Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about an electron's spin state and measuring the probability of it being in certain eigenstates of an operator, plus finding the average value of that operator. Hmm.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of spin, S_z. But the operator whose matrix representation is given isn't S_z; it's another operator with matrix elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. So I need to find the eigenstates of this operator first because the measurement probabilities depend on how |alpha> is expressed in terms of those eigenstates.

Wait, no, actually, the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix looks like this for a 2x2 system (since we have up and down states):
A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]
Wait, because when i≠j, the element is ħ/2, else zero. So yes, it's a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal.

I think this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I multiply that by ħ/2, I get [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], which matches A. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, no, because A_ij is ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So yeah, that's exactly (ħ/2) times σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right?

Wait, wait. The eigenstates of σ_x are indeed those because σ_x flips the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up>
