Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, not necessarily a normalized state.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of their components should equal 1. So I need to find the normalization factor.

Let me compute the normalization. The components are (1+i) and (2 - i). The square of the absolute values would be |1+i|² and |2 - i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7))( (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ).

Okay, now the next part of the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by A_ij, where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. Wait, for a 2x2 system, this would look like a matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. So for a two-level system, the matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are usually defined with entries [0 1; 1 0], so this is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, let me check. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by hbar/2, we get [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], which matches the given A_ij. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of the sigma_x operator are the eigenstates of the given operator. So the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the coefficients.

Alternatively, since the operator is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps I can find the expectation value and the probabilities by using the expectation value formula. But maybe it's easier to find the eigenstates of the operator and then compute the projection.

Let's think about sigma_x. Its eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x is the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, yeah, the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So, the operator in question is (hbar/2) sigma_x, so its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's, just multiplied by a scalar. Therefore, the eigenstates of the given operator are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), respectively.

So now, to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value directly, but the question asks for the probabilities of each eigenstate, which would require projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Wait, let me think. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of |alpha> onto the corresponding eigenstate.

So, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |+x> and |−x>, take the absolute square, and that gives the probabilities.

So, first, let's write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

And the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, the projection of |alpha> onto |+x> is the inner product:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Let me compute this:

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and <up|down> is 0, as they are orthonormal.

So, this simplifies to:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) * 0 + 0 + (2 - i) * 1 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate that.

Wait, the inner product is:

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) ) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ]

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms are zero.

So:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Adding these together:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So,

< +x | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is the absolute square: (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈0.642857.

Hmm, that's approximately 0.64. Now, the other projection onto |−x>.

Compute < −x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] acting on |alpha>.

So,

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 - i) <down|down> ]

Which is:

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

(1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So,

< −x | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

The absolute square is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

But wait, probabilities must add up to 1. Let me check: 9/14 is ~0.6428 and 5/14
