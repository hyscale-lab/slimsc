Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem states that there are three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, right? But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's just a way they found the planets, so perhaps the details of TTV aren't needed for the solution.

The given data includes the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.4. So, T_eq, Planet1 divided by T_eq, Planet2 is 1.4. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T_eq, Planet2 over T_eq, Planet3 is 2.3. 

Also, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So mass of Planet1 over Planet2 is 1.15, and mass of Planet2 over Planet3 is 1.35.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's, given that all three have the same albedo of 0.3. 

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet relates to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, I'm not sure if I remember the exact formula correctly. Alternatively, I think the formula can be simplified when comparing planets around the same star because L and σ would be the same for all.

Oh wait, right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis (distance from the star) and the star's luminosity. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * sqrt( (1 - a) )^(1/4), but maybe I'm mixing some terms. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L(1 - a))^(1/4) divided by D^(1/2), because when you solve the energy balance, the flux from the star is L/(4πD²), and the planet emits as a blackbody with area πR². So F = L/(4πD²) * (1 - a) = 4πR² σ T^4. So solving for T gives T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). 

Since the albedos are the same for all three planets (0.3), the (1 - a) term is the same. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between any two planets depends only on their distances from the star. So T1/T2 = sqrt( (D2/D1) ). Wait, because T is proportional to (L (1-a))^(1/4) / D^(1/2). So T proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So if T1 is higher than T2, then D1 is smaller than D2. Because T1 = [L/(16πσ D1^2)]^(1/4), T2 = [L/(16πσ D2^2)]^(1/4), so T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Therefore, if T1/T2 is 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1. 

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because if D is the distance, and T goes as 1/sqrt(D), then T1 = T_star * (1/sqrt(D1)), T2 = T_star * (1/sqrt(D2)). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2 / D1). So yes, correct. So if T1 is higher than T2, D2 must be larger than D1 because D2 is in the denominator under the square root.

So for Planet1 and Planet2: T1/T2 = 1.4 → sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 ≈ D1 * 1.96.

Similarly, Planet2 and Planet3: T2/T3 = 2.3 → sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2. Let me calculate 2.3 squared. 2.3 * 2.3 is 5.29. So D3 is about 5.29 times D2.

Wait wait, but let me think again. If T2 is higher than T3 (since T2/T3 =2.3), then D3 is larger than D2 because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So yes, D3 = D2 * (T2 / T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 * D2.

So let's compute the distances step by step.

Let me denote D1 as the distance of Planet1, D2 for Planet2, D3 for Planet3.

From T1/T2 =1.4 → D2 = D1 * (1.4)^2 = D1 * 1.96.

From T2/T3=2.3 → D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2 = D2 * 5.29.

Substituting D2 from earlier, D3 = D1 * 1.96 *5.29.

Let me compute 1.96 *5.29. Let's see:

1.96 *5 = 9.8, 1.96 *0.29= approx 0.5684. So total is approx 10.3684. Hmm, maybe more precisely:

1.96 *5.29 = ?

Let me compute 5 *1.96 =9.8. 0.29 *1.96 = let's compute 0.3*1.96=0.588, subtract 0.01*1.96=0.0196 → 0.588 -0.0196=0.5684. So 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684.

So D3 = D1 *10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.37 times D1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period. To find the period, I'll need Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star), assuming the same star. Because for a star, the mass M of the star is much larger than the planets, so the period squared is proportional to D^3/(M), but since M is the same for all, the ratio of periods can be found from the cube roots of the distances.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the form P² ∝ D³. So P = k * D^(3/2), where k is a constant depending on the star's mass and the gravitational constant.

So if I have P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) * sqrt( (M_planet3)/(M_planet1) ) ? Wait, no, Kepler's third law is for the orbit around the same star. The formula is P² = (4π² G⁻¹ M_star⁻¹) * D³. So when comparing two planets around the same star, the periods relate as (D3/D1)^(3/2), since M_star is same.

Wait, but wait, Kepler's third law (simplified for same star) is P² ∝ D³. So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

But wait, the mass of the planet affects the period? No, because the Kepler's law for planets is considering the planet's orbit around the star, and the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the period depends only on the star's mass and the semi-major axis (distance). So the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period. Therefore, the mass ratios given (Planet1/Planet2=1.15, Planet2/Planet3=1.35) might not be directly relevant to the period. Wait, but wait, the question says that the ratio of masses is 1.15 and 1.35. So Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2's mass, Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's mass. So mass of Planet1 is 1.15 * Planet2, which is 1.15 * (1.35 * Planet3's mass) → 1.15 *1.35 = approx 1.5525 times Planet3's mass. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times the mass of Planet3. But as I said, the planet masses are negligible compared to the star, so the period depends on the star's mass and the distance. So the mass ratios might not affect the periods. But wait, perhaps the TTV method (transit timing variations) relies on the gravitational interactions between the planets, so their masses might influence the TTV signals. But for the purpose of calculating the orbital periods, the planet masses are negligible. So the period ratio should be determined solely by the distances, based on Kepler's third law.

So the question is, what's the ratio P3 / P1? Since P² ∝ D³, then P3 / P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

We found earlier that D3/D1 is approximately 10.37, so (10.37)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). Let's break it down.

First, the square root of 10.37 is approximately 3.22, because 3^2=9, 3.2^2=10.24. 3.22^2 is 3.22 *3.22 = let me compute: 3 *3=9, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22*3=0.66, 0.22^2=0.0484. So 3.22^2 = (3 +0.22)^2 = 3² + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22² = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484=10.3684. Which is exactly what 10.37 is. So sqrt(10.37) is 3.22.

So 10.37^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.37))^3 = (3.22)^3.

Let me compute 3.22 cubed.

3.22 *3.22 = about 10.3684 as before.

Then 10.3684 *3.22.

Let's compute 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22 ≈ 1.1855 (since 0.3684 *3=1.1052, 0.3684 *0.22= approx 0.0809, so total 1.1861). So total is approx 32.2 +1.1861=33.386.

So (10.37)^(3/2) is approximately 33.386.

So P3/P1 is about 33.4. So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than Planet1's.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation steps.

1. Calculated T ratios to get D ratios:

   T1/T2=1.4 → D2/D1= (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

   T2/T3=2.3 → D3/D2= (2.3)^2=5.29. So D3=5.29*D2 =5.29 *1.96 D1 =10.3684 D1.

2. Then, for Kepler's law: P² proportional to D³ → P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

3. As above, sqrt(10.3684)=3.22, so 3.22^3= ?

3.22^3: 3 *3.22=9.66; 0.22*3.22=0.7084. So 3.22^3 = (3 +0.22)^3 = 3^3 + 3*(3^2)*0.22 + 3*3*(0.22)^2 + (0.22)^3.

Wait, that's more precise:

= 27 + 3*(9)*0.22 + 3*(3)*(0.0484) + 0.010648

=27 + 5.94 + 0.4356 + 0.010648 ≈ 27 +5.94=32.94 +0.4356=33.3756 +0.010648=33.386 approx 33.386.

So yes, about 33.4. So option D is ~33.4.

Wait a minute, but the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 being larger than that of Planet1. So yes, it's 33.4 times larger. So the answer is D.

But wait, let me check if I considered the right exponents. Because (D3/D1) is 10.3684, and the exponent is 3/2. So (10.3684)^(3/2) → which is the same as (10.3684^1) * (10.3684^0.5) )=10.3684 * sqrt(10.3684). Wait no, that's not right, because 3/2 is 1.5, so it's better to compute as (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

Alternatively, let me compute 10.3684^(1.5).

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as e^( (ln(10.3684)) * 1.5 ).

Compute ln(10.3684)= approximately 2.338.

Multiply by 1.5: 3.507.

e^3.507 is about e^3 is 20.085, e^3.5 is about 33.115. So 3.507 is a touch higher, so e^3.507≈33.4. So yes, approximately 33.4.

So the answer should be option D, ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital distance, and Kepler's third law.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Orbital Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance from the star, assuming the same albedo and star luminosity. The formula for the equilibrium temperature is:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

From the given temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_2 / D_1} = 1.4 \), so \( D_2 / D_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( \sqrt{D_3 / D_2} = 2.3 \), so \( D_3 / D_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

Combining these, the distance of Planet3 relative to Planet1 is:

\[
D_3 / D_1 = D_3 / D_2 \cdot D_2 / D_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684
\]

Thus, \( D_3 = D_1 \cdot 10.3684 \).

### Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance:

\[
P^2 \propto D^3 \quad \text{or} \quad P \propto D^{3/2}
\]

The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet3 and Planet1 is:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 = 10.3684 \):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \)
First, calculate the square root of \( 10.3684 \):

\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, cube this result:

\[
(3.22)^3 = 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \cdot 3.22 \approx 33.386
\]

Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4 \).

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
