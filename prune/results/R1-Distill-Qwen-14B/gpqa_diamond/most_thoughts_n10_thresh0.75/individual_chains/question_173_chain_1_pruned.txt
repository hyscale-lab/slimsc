Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron given its uncertainty in position (Δx) and its speed (v). Hmm.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The principle is often expressed as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Since the question asks for the minimum uncertainty, I guess I should use the equality here, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh right, because energy is related to momentum and kinetic energy. So maybe I can relate Δp to ΔE. Let's think about kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (K) of a particle is (1/2)mv², but since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps ΔK would be related to Δp. Because K = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in K would involve Δp squared over mass or something like that.

Wait, let me think again. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Since the electron's speed is given as v = 2e8 m/s along x, maybe I can find Δp.

Wait, but the speed is given as v, but Δx is the uncertainty in position. So perhaps the uncertainty in momentum is the same as the momentum itself, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, considering that Δp is approximately equal to mΔv, but here we don't have Δv, but perhaps we can find some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is related to the uncertainty in momentum. So, since K = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in K would be (p²)(Δp²)/(2m²) or wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, using differentials, ΔK ≈ (dK/dp) * Δp. Since dK/dp = p/m, then ΔK ≈ (p/m) Δp. But wait, p is m*v, so (p/m) is v. So ΔK ≈ v * Δ
