Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? I think pp-I and pp-II are earlier steps in the proton-proton cycle.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stops about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, that's the same time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. Oh, wait, no, that's the time it takes for photons to reach us. Because neutrinos move at almost the speed of light, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already reached Earth. But wait, neutrinos are produced in the core, so if the process stops, the neutrinos from that process would stop arriving. But wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km. Light takes about 8 minutes to get here, so neutrinos would take about the same time. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have arrived and stopped. But wait, the flux we measure today would have started to decrease because the source is gone.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions are as they were. So other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still producing neutr
