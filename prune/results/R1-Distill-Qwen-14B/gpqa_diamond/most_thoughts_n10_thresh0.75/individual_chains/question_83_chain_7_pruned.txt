Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Alright, first, I think I need to figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 liters). 

Using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05, V1 is 0.020 L. V2 is 0.040 L. So M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 * 0.020)/0.040 = (0.001)/0.040 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when diluted, it dissociates a bit more. But for concentration calculations before titration, I think we just need the concentration.

Now, the titration with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So let's find out how much NaOH is added.

First, find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 0.040 L, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, this will convert 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH into CH3COO^-.

So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the amount of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when doing a titration, the total volume increases because we're adding NaOH. So I need to calculate the total volume at 25% titration to find the concentrations.

Wait, how much NaOH is used? The concentration is 0.1 M. Moles of NaOH used is 0.00025 mol. So volume of NaOH added is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So the total volume of the solution at 25% titration is initial volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations after 25% titration would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but wait, I think I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because it's a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733. Wait, let's calculate it more accurately. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. So log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log([0.00025 /0.0425] / [0.00075 / 0.0425]) ) Wait, no: [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 and [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425. So the ratio is (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) ) = 0.00025 / 0.00
