Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I remember that titration problems usually involve figuring out the pH at certain points, like the equivalence point or specific percentages. 

So, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. 

The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. 

I think the first step is to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume (L). So, initial moles = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. 

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles / total volume. Moles are 0.001, volume is 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. 

Wait, but when we titrate, the amount of NaOH added will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, for each mole of NaOH added, a mole of acetic acid is neutralized, producing acetate ions. 

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid and moles of NaOH added at that point. 

Wait, perhaps I should figure out the equivalence point first. Because maybe that will help me with the second part of the question. 

The equivalence point is when all
