Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is present. The given data includes the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't think I have to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything like that. The temperature is 25°C, which I guess is standard.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is CaEDTA^2- maybe? So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. But wait, the exact stoichiometry might matter here. Oh, right, the problem says it's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so I think that means each Ca^2+ binds with one EDTA^4- to form the complex.

The formation constant, K, is given. Formation constants can be a bit tricky. From what I recall, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formula for Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5x10^10.

Wait, but in this case, we have 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. That means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So we can think that initially, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, this is the concentration at equilibrium. Because the complex is present, the dissociation would be minimal due to the high Kf, which is a very large number, implying that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.

I need to find [Ca^2+]. Let's think about the expression.

The formation constant equation is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in this case, the initial solution is 0
