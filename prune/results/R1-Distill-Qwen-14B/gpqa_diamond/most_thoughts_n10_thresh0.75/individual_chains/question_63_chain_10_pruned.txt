Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled with both rotational and vibrational energy states. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So we're looking for the next state. But wait, what's the next state? Oh right, in the quantum model, the energy levels have specific steps. For the rotational and vibrational parts, each has their own quantum numbers.

Wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that's the rotation-vibration model where the bond isn't perfectly rigid, so the rotational and vibrational energies are coupled. But I'm not sure if that affects the photon energy calculation here. Maybe it does, maybe not. Let me think.

The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by some formula combining rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), and the rotational state with the lowest possible angular momentum (probably J=0, but I'm not entirely sure).

Wait, but when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. However, the problem states that the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I guess that the next possible state would be the next higher energy state overall, which might be the first vibrational excited state (v=1) with the same rotational
