Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. There are two steps given, and I need to choose between the options A to D for the reagents A and B.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh right, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. So when a ketone reacts with CN- (from NaCN), it's typically under certain conditions. I recall that the formation of a cyanohydrin involves adding a CN- to the carbonyl group. The mechanism usually involves the CN- acting as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate which then gets protonated.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's think about the structure of the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: the nitrile is on carbon 1, then a CH2 group, then a carbon with hydroxyl and methyl groups. Wait, maybe I need to draw it out.

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but that's not right. Wait, nitrile is -CN, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's pentanenitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, it would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation adds a hydroxyl and a nitrile group to the carbonyl carbon. So for (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So let's see: butanenitrile would be four carbons
