Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two particles of opposite charge, A+ and A-. The equation given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Wait, no, wait. The question says it's 2A+ and 2A-? So four particles in total? Or two each. Oh, right, yeah. So each A is maybe a pion or something else, but the specifics might not matter. The important part is the masses and the energy involved.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, its speed is much less than the speed of light. That probably means we can use non-relativistic approximations for the antiproton's energy. But wait, no, wait, because when particles annihilate, the products can have relativistic speeds. So the particles A might be moving at significant fractions of the speed of light.

The given mass of A is m_A c² = 300 MeV. I'm trying to remember, the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So the A particle is much lighter than a proton. Hmm, that's something to note.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So, I need to figure out the velocity using the conservation laws—probably energy and momentum.

Since it's an annihilation process, the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The proton is probably at rest? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. But wait, in annihilation processes, the initial particles' momenta will affect the products. Hmm.

Wait, let's read the problem again. The antiproton is slowly moving. So the initial state is a proton (maybe at rest) and an antiproton moving slowly. So in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is the momentum of the antiproton. But if it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate certain things.

But wait, in annihilation, the energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much
