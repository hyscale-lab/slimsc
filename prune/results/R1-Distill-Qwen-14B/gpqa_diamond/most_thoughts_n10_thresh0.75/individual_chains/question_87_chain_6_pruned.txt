Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR peaks indicate a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Hmm, wait a second. Di-substituted aromatic ring means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. Oh, but wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents contribute 2 more carbons. Because 6 (from benzene) + 2 = 8. So the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. But wait, each substituent is attached to the benzene. Let me think: substituents could be two single-carbon groups or maybe one with more.

But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. A carbonyl is usually a C=O. So one of the substituents is a carbonyl. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond. So another substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br.

Wait, but substituents on benzene can't be just any groups. So, the two substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen (-X). Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, but if the substituents are each single atoms (like X and O?), but that wouldn't add up. Because substituent groups usually have more carbons. Wait, maybe the substituents are an acyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene (6) + substituents (2) = 8. So substituents have two carbons total. So perhaps each substituent is a single carbon, but wait, that might not add up. Let me think: substituent 1 could be a carbonyl group, like -CO-R, but maybe R is a methyl or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkoxy group.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen. But wait, that would be two substituents each contributing one carbon. But a carbonyl group like -
