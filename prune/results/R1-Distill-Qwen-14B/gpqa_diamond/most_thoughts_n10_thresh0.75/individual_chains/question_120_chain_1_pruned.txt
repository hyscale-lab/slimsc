Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that means their density is the same everywhere, right? Wait, no, uniform distribution usually implies that the number per unit volume is constant. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. If they're uniformly distributed in the sky, does that mean they're spread out uniformly in space, or just on the celestial sphere? Hmm, I think it refers to their spatial distribution, not just their apparent positions. So, imagine the universe is filled with stars with a uniform density.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So, I'm thinking about parallax here. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So, higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, the problem is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So, like, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range? And how does this number depend on plx.

Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. Let's denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec). So, in a small volume dV, the number of stars is n * dV.

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax is a measure of distance, and distance is the key here. So, let's think about a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4πd² dd. Because if you have a sphere of radius d, the volume is (4/3)πd³. The shell's volume is the difference between (4/3)π(d+dd)^3 and (4/3)πd³. For small dd, this approximates to 4πd² dd.

So, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd. But wait, we're interested in the number per unit parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. Let me express everything in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd
