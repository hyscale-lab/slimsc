Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a higher parallax value. Like, plx = 1/distance or something like that. So the higher the parallax, the closer the star.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So uniform distribution in space? Or in some other way? Wait, I think in astronomy, when they say stars are uniformly distributed, it usually means that their density is uniform in space. So the number of stars per volume is the same everywhere.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So it's about the number of stars in a given parallax interval, like between plx and plx + dplx. How does that count change as plx changes?

Let me visualize this. If I imagine a sphere with radius r, the volume is (4/3)πr³. So the number of stars in that volume would be the density times the volume. But since the density is uniform, the number increases with volume, which is proportional to r³, or 1/(plx)^3 because r is inversely proportional to plx.

Wait, right, because plx = 1/(distance), so distance = 1/plx. So the volume is
