Okay, so I've been given this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, parallax is a concept I remember from my astronomy classes. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, the closer the star, the larger the parallax because you can see the shift more easily. So a larger parallax means the star is closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that probably means they spread out evenly in all directions, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the number of stars we count. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I think about it, the number of stars in a certain parallax range. Like, how many stars have parallax between, say, 1 arcsecond and 2 arcseconds.

Wait, what's the relation between distance and parallax? Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if a star has a parallax of 1 parsec, it's 1 parsec away. If another has 0.5, it's twice as far. So higher parallax means closer.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on the volume of space they occupy. Because in a uniform distribution, the number of stars you encounter depends on how much volume you're looking at. But because we're dealing with parallax, which is related to distance, I think the distribution in terms of distance isn't uniform in parsecs. Oh, right, because when you go further away, each parsec you cover is a larger volume than the previous.

Wait, let me think about how the number of stars per unit distance changes. In a uniform distribution, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So if we consider a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, the volume is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r² dr. Because number density is uniform, so N(r) dr = n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density.

But wait, the question is about parallax, not distance. So we need to relate this to parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/pl
