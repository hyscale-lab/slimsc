Okay, I need to figure out the correct reagents for these two reactions. Let's start by looking at each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. Normally, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions where the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. Sodium cyanide would provide the CN- ion. But wait, under what conditions does this happen? I think that in acidic conditions, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic because the ketone gets protonated. So maybe reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or H2SO4 or something similar. But looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ and NaHSO3.

But wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Which is a weaker acid, right? Or is it used in another type of reaction? Oh, wait, if the carbonyl is protonated, then the nucleophilic attack can happen. So butan-2-one plus NaCN would need acid to activate the carbonyl. So A could be H3O+.

Now the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a C-OH and a C-CN group? Wait, wait. No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is added to the carbonyl carbon. So after adding CN-, the product would have the structure NC-C-(OH)(CH3)2? Because when a ketone reacts with CN-, it adds to the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in the product, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone, which then gets protonated. But then
