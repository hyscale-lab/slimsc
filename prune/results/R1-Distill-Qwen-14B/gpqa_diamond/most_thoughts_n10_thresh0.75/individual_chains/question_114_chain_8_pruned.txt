Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually via some kind of substitution or addition. Wait, butan-2-one is acetone. So the first reaction is between acetone and NaCN, but with some reagent A. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group, so maybe it's a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN and something else?

Wait, acetone (propan-2-one) has the structure (CH3)2CO. Reacting it with NaCN probably involves some kind of nucleophilic substitution. But wait, acetone isn't a good substrate for SN2 because the carbonyl group is a poor leaving group. Oh wait, but maybe it's an addition-elimination mechanism, like the formation of cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation reaction. That's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group.

So, the cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin, which has both OH and CN groups attached to the same carbon. For that, the ketone would add CN- (from NaCN) and water or another proton source. Wait, the mechanism: the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then, CN- attacks, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the leaving group is water, which takes a proton, and then the hydroxyl group is formed.

So the reagent A must be an acid catalyst. Because in the cyanohydrin formation, you typically use an acid like H3O+ (sulfuric acid maybe) as a catalyst. So looking at the options, for reagent A, it's either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: could it be a hydrolysis reaction? Let's think. If acetone reacts with NaCN under certain conditions, maybe via a different pathway. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of the formation of an imine or something else, but I think the cyanohydrin is more likely here.

So A is probably H3O+ as the acid catalyst. Now looking at the options, in option A, A is H3O+, and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Option C has A as NaHSO3, B as HCl. Option D has both as NaHSO3 and CH3COOH.

So for the first
