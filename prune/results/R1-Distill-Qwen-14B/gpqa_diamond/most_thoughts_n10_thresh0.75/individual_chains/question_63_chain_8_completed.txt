Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about determining the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when absorbed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me start by recalling what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I remember that in such models, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are considered as a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. The model probably treats the molecule as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator combined, but since it's called non-rigid, maybe there's a bit more to it. Wait, no, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length doesn't change, while the non-rigid rotor (or sometimes called the "rotating dumbbell") allows for some stretching. Oh, but wait, maybe the question is actually talking about the rigid rotor plus a harmonic oscillator for vibration. Because the bond length is given, and the angular frequency. So perhaps it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state. For a harmonic oscillator, the fundamental state is n=0. But wait, when considering rotation and vibration together, the states are a product of rotational and vibrational states. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), right? Or is it possible that the fundamental state includes the next rotational state? No, I think J=0 is the lowest rotation state.

The question asks what photon momentum is needed to switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state after the fundamental. So the fundamental state is the lowest. The next higher state would be the next possible energy level. In a rotational-vibrational model, the energy levels are quantized and have specific spacing. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases by the photon's energy, which corresponds to a transition to a higher state.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the initial state is the lowest possible. To find the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think it's the next energy level above the fundamental. But I need to figure out what that transition is. Because in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The vibrational energy is (n + 1/2) ħω, and the rotational is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The fundamental state is n=0 and J=0, so E_initial = (0 + 1/2) ħω + (0)(0+1) ħ²/(2I) = (1/2) ħω.

Now, the next state with the lowest energy. Hmm, what's the next possible higher energy state? It could be either an increase in J (rotational state) or an increase in n (vibrational state). Wait, but in the rotational-vibration model, the energy levels are not just simply adding; each level has a certain order, and the transitions can be either vibrational or rotational or a combination.

But in this case, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires less energy? Going from J=0 to J=1 (rotational transition) would require a certain amount of energy, and going to n=1 (vibrational) would require a higher energy because the vibrational energy levels are spaced by ħω each, which is typically much larger than the rotational energy spacing.

Wait, but the spacing between rotational levels depends on the moment of inertia. Let me think: the energy difference between J and J+1 is given by ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] * ħ²/(2I) = (2J+3) ħ²/(2I).

At J=0, the ΔE for rotation is (2*0 +3) * ħ²/(2I)= 3 ħ²/(2I).

The vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is ħω.

So which is smaller: 3 ħ²/(2I) or ħω?

If the vibrational transition requires less energy, then the next state would be vibrational. Otherwise, it would be rotational.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we need to find the photon that switches it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment.

So, I need to compute both ΔE_rot (from J=0→1) and ΔE_vib (from n=0→1) and see which is smaller.

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is quantized, and the spacing between J and J+1 levels is about (2J+1)ħ²/(2I). For J=0, that's 3ħ²/(2I). So the energy needed for a rotation transition is 3ħ²/(2I). 

So let me compute both possible ΔE's.

First, compute I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/(22) = approximately 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert amu to kg for calculations.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (let's approximate 1.818 ≈ 1.82)

1.82 * 1.6605 = approximately 3.017.

So μ ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.068e-47 kg m² ≈ 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ΔE_rot for J=0→1.

ΔE_rot = 3 ħ²/(2I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So ΔE_rot = 3 * (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2068e-46) ) J.

Let me compute denominator: 2 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.4136e-46.

So numerator: 3 * 1.112e-68 = 3.336e-68.

So 3.336e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ (3.336 / 2.4136) * 1e-22 ≈ 1.382 * 1e-22 = 1.382e-22 J.

Alternatively, wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22. So yes.

Now, compute ΔE_vib, which is ħω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, compare the two ΔE's:

ΔE_rot ≈ 1.382e-22 J

ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J

So ΔE_rot is much smaller than ΔE_vib. Therefore, the photon should cause a transition to the next rotational state (J=1), because that requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait. No, because the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state after the fundamental (n=0, J=0) would be either J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0. Which has lower energy? Let me see:

E(J=1, n=0) = (1/2) ħω + [ (1)(2) * ħ²/(2I) ) ] = (1/2) ħω + [2 ħ²/(2I)] = (1/2) ħω + ħ²/(I).

E(J=0, n=1) = (1/2 + 1) ħω + [0 * 1 * ħ²/(2I)] = (3/2) ħω.

So which is smaller, (1/2 ħω + ħ²/(I)) or 3/2 ħω?

Compute (1/2 ħω) + (ħ²/I) compared to (3/2 ħω).

The difference would be [ (3/2) - (1/2) ] ħω = ħω and subtracting (ħ²/I).

So if (ħ²/I) < ħω, then E(J=1, n=0) is lower than E(n=1, J=0).

Wait, let me compute the two terms.

From earlier, ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2068e-46) → Let me compute this.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Compare this to ħω =1.054e-34 * 4e14 = approx 4.216e-20 J.

So 9.21e-23 J is much less than 4.216e-20 J. Therefore, (1/2 ħω + 9.21e-23) is (2.1e-20 + 9.21e-23) ≈ 2.19e-20 J. Whereas 3/2 ħω is 6.324e-20 J.

So E(J=1, n=0) is about 2.19e-20 J, and E(n=1, J=0) is 6.324e-20 J. Thus, the next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0, since it's lower than n=1, J=0.

Therefore, the transition is from (n=0, J=0) to (n=0, J=1). So the photon energy needed is the difference in rotational energy: 3 ħ²/(2I) ≈ 1.382e-22 J.

Wait, earlier I thought the rotational ΔE was 1.38e-22 J. So that's the energy of the photon needed.

But the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E = pc (since for photons, E = pc, because their mass is zero and they move at speed c).

So E_photon = pc → p = E_photon / c.

Wait, E_photon is 1.382e-22 J. Let's compute p.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

p = 1.382e-22 J / 3e8 m/s.

1.382e-22 / 3e8 = (1.382 /3 )e-30 ≈ 0.4607e-30 = 4.607e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me check my calculation of ΔE_rot again.

Wait, earlier when I calculated ΔE_rot, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

ΔE_rot is for J=0 → J=1.

The energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (J(J+1) ħ²)/(2I).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = [ (1*2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, wait a minute! That's different from what I thought earlier. Because I had earlier said 3 ħ²/(2I) for ΔE_rot, but that would be the case for the (2J+1) factor in the selection rule, but perhaps the actual energy difference is just E_1 - E_0.

Wait, no, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = [ (1*2) / (2I) ] ħ² - [0/(2I)] ħ² ) = (2/(2I)) ħ² = (1/I) ħ².

Wait, yes, because E_J = [ J(J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I) )

So E_1 = [2] * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I)

E_0 = 0.

So the difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I ) = 1.112e-68 J·s² / 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Wait, but let me compute that again.

ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s² (Wait, actually, no. ħ has units of J·s. So ħ squared has units J²·s². But I'm dividing by I, which is kg·m². So the units of ħ²/I would be (J² s²)/(kg m²) ). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here, but perhaps it's easier to just compute the numerical value.

Compute ħ²/(I):

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.2068e-46 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

So the energy difference ΔE_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

Ah, so that's the energy required for the transition. So the photon's energy should be this value.

But wait, earlier I thought the ΔE_rot was 3ħ²/(2I), but that's not correct. The correct difference is ħ²/(I).

So the correct ΔE_rot is about 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but now compare that to ΔE_vib, which is ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

So 9.21e-23 J is much smaller than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule will transition to the next state via a rotational change, not vibrational.

So the photon's energy must be 9.21e-23 J.

So the momentum p is given by E = pc, so p = E / c.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me compute this exactly.

9.21e-23 / 3e8 = (9.21 / 3) * 1e-31 = 3.07 * 1e-31 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them are in the 1e-31 range. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) p = 1.9e-28 N·s → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s

B) p = 2.3e-27 kg·m/s

C) p = 1.1e-27 kg·m/s

D) p =1.4e-28 kg·m/s

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg·m/s is 3.07e-31 = 0.307e-30 = 3.07e-31. But none of the options are in that range. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait a second, perhaps I mixed up the rotational and vibrational energy transitions. Because maybe the photon needs to cause a transition where both rotational and vibrational states change, but I thought the next lowest state would be just J=1, n=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the first overtone in vibration, but that would require a higher energy. Or perhaps the model allows for other transitions. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the next state is a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The next state with the lowest energy after the fundamental state would be the next available state, which is either the first rotational state or the first vibrational state.

But from earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy, so that's the one the photon would cause.

Wait, but the momentum calculation I did gave me 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So I must have made a mistake in some of the calculations.

Let me go back and recheck the steps.

First, let me recompute the moment of inertia I. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let me compute:

1.818 * 1.6605 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.6605= approx 2.989, and 0.018 * 1.6605= approx 0.0299 → total approx 3.0189e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0189e-27 kg.

Bond length r=2 angstroms= 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.0189e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0189e-27 * 4e-20 = 12.0756e-47 kg m² = 1.20756e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ħ²/(I):

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.20756e-46 = Let's compute that.

Dividing 1.112e-68 by 1.20756e-46 → 1.112 / 1.20756 ≈ 0.92, and 1e-68 /1e-46 =1e-22.

So ħ²/(I) ≈ 0.92e-22 J = 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy must be 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the photon's momentum p is E/c.

E = 9.2e-23 J.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.07 * 1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the transition is a vibrational one, but that would require a larger energy, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibration is considered, but the main energy comes from rotation.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the energy difference in the rotational state, but in the vibrational state. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the model in question includes the bond vibrations, so the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next higher state would be the next vibrational state (n=1), which requires a photon with energy ħω.

But wait, earlier I calculated that the rotational transition requires less energy (9.2e-23 J) compared to the vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J). So the photon's energy should be the smaller one, leading to a rotational transition.

So why is the calculated momentum so much smaller than the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the model. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the next state, not the rotational one. But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational transitions. But that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are considered as the sum of rotational and vibrational terms, and the next state is the first state where either n or J increases. But the minimal energy increment is in the rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is around 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns since 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s

B) 2.3e-27...

C) 1.1e-27...

D) 1.4e-28...

So 3e-31 is much smaller than the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the vibrational transition. Let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħω.

p = E_photon / c = (1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 1/s ) / 3e8 m/s.

Compute numerator: 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Then p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the rotational transition requires less energy, so this would not be the next state. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is considering the next state as the first vibrational state, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference.

Wait, let's re-examine the energy difference for the rotational transition. For J=0→J=1, E = [ J(J+1) - J'(J'+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I)).

Wait, J goes from 0 to 1. So E_0 = 0, E_1 = (1*2) ħ²/(2I) = 2 ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

So photon energy is 9.2e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But again, none of the options match this. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the next state refers to the next energy level in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, which is the combination of both. But that's more complicated, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expected is purely rotational, and the question is only considering rotational transitions. But in that case, the energy is the rotational transition, but the momentum is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the bond as a rigid rotor, and the vibrational part as a harmonic oscillator, but perhaps the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the next state is n=1, requiring a photon with energy ħω.

In that case, p_photon = (ħω) / c.

Compute that: ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s, ω=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s → 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

But according to our earlier analysis, the rotational transition requires less energy, so why would the next state be the vibrational one?

Ah, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational model, not the rotational, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Or perhaps the non-rigid rotor model is actually considering the stretching, and the fundamental state is n=0, J=0, and the next state is n=1, J=0.

But given that the rotational transition requires less energy, perhaps the correct photon's energy should be the rotational one, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the next state is the first vibrational state, so the photon's energy is ħω, leading to p=1.4e-28, option D.

But why would that be? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational energy. Perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotation is treated as a separate entity, and the question is focusing on the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state (n=0), but the rotational state could be in a higher J. But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the next state after the fundamental is the first overtone in vibration, but that requires more energy.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible answers. Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which would correspond to the vibrational transition. But according to our earlier calculation, the rotational transition is possible with a much lower momentum.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the photon causing a transition to the next state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational transition, but according to the quantum selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for rotational transitions in a diatomic molecule are ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δn = ±1. So if the molecule is in the J=0 state, it can transition to J=1 upon absorbing a photon with the appropriate energy.

So, perhaps the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition, but the options don't show that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, which would give option D.

But given that the rotational transition requires less energy, I'm confused why the answer isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me try to compute the energy difference between the vibrational and rotational transitions.

Wait, the vibrational energy quantum is much larger than the rotational quantum. So the next state after the fundamental is the first vibrational excited state (n=1, J=0), requiring a photon with energy ħω.

So E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 → 1.406e-28 kg m/s → approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition would be lower, so the molecule would transition to J=1, n=0 first. However, perhaps in the context of the question, the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the next vibrational state. Or perhaps the problem is to consider only vibrational transitions.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational and vibrational energies are treated differently. Or perhaps the question is simplified, considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't allow for rotational transitions because the bond is rigid. But no, the question states it's the non-rigid rotor model, which allows for bond stretching and thus rotational transitions.

Hmm. I'm stuck. All my calculations suggest that the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't have the corresponding momentum. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I, or the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of I.

Wait, r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ * r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, which gives p_photon ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close to this.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the energy change. Because for a rigid rotor, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B, where B is the rotational constant, B= ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference is 2B.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is B (from J=0 to J=1).

Wait, let me re-express the rotations.

Energy levels: E_J = B J (J+1), where B = ħ²/(2I).

So for J=0, E=0.

J=1: E=2B.

So the energy difference is 2B.

B = ħ²/(2I) → 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.207e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.21e-23 J, which matches the earlier calculation. So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

So p_photon = 9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps the problem is not about the rotational transition but the vibrational one.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the harmonic oscillator model, where the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0), and the first transition is to n=1, which requires a photon with energy ħω.

In that case, E_photon = ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p_photon=4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s → approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So according to this, the answer is option D.

But why would the question not consider the rotational transition, which requires less energy? Maybe the question is simplified and only considering the vibrational transition. Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model in this problem is considering the vibrational energy as the main factor, and the rotational transition is not considered.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reread the question.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is n=0 and J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the state with the smallest energy increment. So the possible next states could be:

1. n=0, J=1 → ΔE_rot = 2B =9.2e-23 J.

2. n=1, J=0 → ΔE_vib = ħω =4.2e-20 J.

So the first is much lower in energy. So the photon should have energy 9.2e-23 J, which gives p_photon = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects the answer based on the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me compute the rotational energy again.

I have I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / (2.414e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

So for J=0→1, ΔE = E_1 - E_0 = 2B = 9.214e-23 J.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the momentum into Ns. Because 1 Ns is 1 kg·m/s.

So p_photon = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is much larger. So perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, even though it's higher in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model, and the next state after the fundamental is the first vibrational state, not considering rotation.

But according to the earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's momentum would be 3e-31 Ns, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition.

But why the discrepancy? Maybe the question intended to have the next state as a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the photon's energy as the sum of rotational and vibrational transitions, but that doesn't make sense because the next state should be the one with the minimal energy increase.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's energy to be in the ground vibrational state (n=0) but in a higher rotational state (J=1), and the photon induces a transition to a higher energy but in the same vibrational state. Or perhaps the question is asking about the next state when considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

Mass of X: 20 amu.

Mass of Y: 2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20/11 is approximately 1.818, yes.

So μ = 1.818 amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 → 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy difference in terms of the rotational constant B.

B = ħ²/(2I) = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.207e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 ≈4.607e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot =2B= 9.214e-23 J.

Again, same result.

So the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is expecting only the vibrational transition, and the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference. Let me compute it again.

Another approach: perhaps the energy difference is being calculated as (J+1) times B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the energy for J=0 is 0, J=1 is 2B, so the difference is 2B.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the photon's energy as the vibrational transition, which is ħω, leading to p_photon = ħω/c.

Which is 1.05457e-34 *4e14 /3e8 = (4.218e-20)/3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But why would that be the case, given the rotational transition is lower in energy?

Perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Given the options, the only matching one for the vibrational transition is D.

So the answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to switch the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could either involve a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) or a vibrational transition (n=0 → n=1). The energy required for each transition is compared to identify the correct photon momentum.

### Key Calculations and Analysis:

1. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]
   The bond length is given as \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). The moment of inertia is:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition (J=0 → J=1):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1),
   \]
   where \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The energy difference for \( J=0 \to J=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Vibrational Energy Transition (n=0 → n=1):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
   \]
   where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). The energy difference for \( n=0 \to n=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega.
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Comparison of Energy Transitions:**
   The rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)) requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)). However, none of the provided options match the momentum corresponding to the rotational transition. Therefore, the problem likely assumes the vibrational transition is being considered, even though it requires more energy.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]
   Converting to \( \text{N·s} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{kg·m/s} = 1 \, \text{N·s} \)):
   \[
   p \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated momentum for the rotational transition does not match any of the provided options. Based on the given options and the assumption that the vibrational transition is being considered, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
