Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Similarly, for the second state with Δt2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

Now, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, I think. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 ≈ 7.25e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. Or is it the maximum of the two? Hmm. Because the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties to be resolved. So the energy difference must be greater than the sum, otherwise the two states' energies could overlap in the uncertainty intervals. So yes, the minimum ΔE needed is about 7.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001 meV. That's way smaller than 7e-7 eV. So too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. No.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 7e-7. So 1e-4 is bigger than 7e-7, which is 0.0000007. So 0.0001 is much bigger than that. So this would be sufficient.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's still smaller than 7.25e-7. Because 7.25e-7 is 0.000000725. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller. So not enough.

Wait, so the correct energy difference should be at least approximately 7.25e-7 eV. So among the options, the only one larger than that is option C at 1e-4 eV. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again. Did I get the exponents right?

Wait, for ΔE1: 1e-9 s. So 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J. 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.25e-7 eV. Correct.

ΔE2 is 1e-8 s, so 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 6.25e-8 eV.

Sum is 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 = 7.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 7.875e-7 eV. The options provided:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's 100 times larger than 7.875e-6 eV (since 7.8e-6 is 0.0000078 eV). Wait, no, wait: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.8e-7 eV (which is 0.00000078 eV). Because 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger than 7.8e-7.

So yes, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than what's needed. So that would allow the two states to be clearly resolved.

Wait, but why is the option C 1e-4 eV? Because that's 0.0001 eV. That's a pretty sizable energy difference, but in terms of quantum mechanics, I think it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the time as the standard deviation, so the uncertainty is ħ/(2Δt). Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So perhaps I should have used that.

Wait, so the correct formula is ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So maybe I should have considered that. Let me recalculate.

For ΔE1: ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.055e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ) = (1.055e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.275e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, for Δt2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.055e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.275e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.275e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than ~3.6e-7 eV.

Looking back at the options, the only option larger than this is C (1e-4 eV), which is 1e-4 is 1e4 times bigger than 3.6e-7. So that's definitely larger.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate uncertainties for each state
For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]
Convert to electron volts:
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in energy difference
To resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \) must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \text{meV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than Option A. Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is significantly larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
