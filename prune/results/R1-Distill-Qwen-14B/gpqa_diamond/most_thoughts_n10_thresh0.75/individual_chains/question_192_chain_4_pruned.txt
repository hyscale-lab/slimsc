Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The point's distance from the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So I need to find the electric field E at point P.

I remember that when dealing with conductors and charge distributions, the concept of electrostatic shielding might come into play. Wait, but the conductor is uncharged. So how does the charge inside the cavity affect the outside?

I think that when a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges on the conductor reside on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged. So if we have a charge inside a cavity, which is within the conductor, how does that influence the charges on the conductor itself?

Oh, right! If the conductor is neutral, the presence of the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. The inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is neutral and the positive charge inside attracts opposite charges. But then, what happens on the outer surface?

Wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, which means the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge is zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, the inner induced -q must be balanced by a +q on the outer surface.

So, for the point P outside the conductor (since L > R), the electric field should be due to the outer charge. But wait, the outer surface charge is distributed uniformly because the conductor is spherical. Or wait, is the outer surface charge distribution affected by the position of the cavity's charge?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface will have a charge of +q. But because the outer surface
