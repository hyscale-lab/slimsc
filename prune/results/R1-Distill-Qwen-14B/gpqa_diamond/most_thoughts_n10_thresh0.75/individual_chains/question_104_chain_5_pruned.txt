Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, and this causes shifts in the spectral lines.

The setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as each other, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding how the RV method relates the observed shift to the planet's orbital parameters. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift (or the radial velocity) is proportional to the velocity of the star. The actual formula I recall is:

K = (V) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_*)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler approximation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. Since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun, we can probably ignore M_p in M_* + M_p. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so that term simplifies.

Another approach I remember is that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But wait, there's a more straightforward formula when the star's mass dominates. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (P)^{1/3} * c ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a relationship between the RV shifts and the orbital periods, given that the stars have the same mass.

Both stars have the same mass, M. The planets have similar masses, but wait the question says both have masses similar to Neptune, which is about 17 Earth masses. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So the only variables here are the orbital periods, P.

Wait, but the RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K is what's given here. The shift in the spectral lines is proportional to K. So K is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is what causes the Doppler shift.

So the question gives K1 = 5 milliangstroms, K2 = 7 milliangstroms. Wait, no, the
