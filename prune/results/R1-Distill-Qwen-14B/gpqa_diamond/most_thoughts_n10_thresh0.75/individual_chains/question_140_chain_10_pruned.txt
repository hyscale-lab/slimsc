Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. This reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W. The fact that W's molecule has equal numbers of protons and neutrons suggests it's something like H2O (but wait, that's H and O; protons and neutrons? Let me think. H has 1 proton, O has 8, so H2O has 2 H and 1 O, so maybe not. Wait, another possibility: maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has one C and two O. The molecule could be something else. Wait, the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule must be the same. So for example, if W is CH4, each molecule has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons?), but CH4 has 5 H each. Wait, no, the molecule's total protons and neutrons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the gas W: each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, maybe for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons. For example, H2O: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So H2O has 2 protons and 8 neutrons (since O has 8 neutrons in H2O?), wait no, O can have different isotopes. Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom contributes to the total. Or perhaps each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in its entire molecule. So, for example, if W is CO2, the total protons would be 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Neutrons
