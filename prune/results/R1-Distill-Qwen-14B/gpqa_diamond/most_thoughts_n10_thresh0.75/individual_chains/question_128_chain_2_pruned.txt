Okay, so I've just started my job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 and then purify it quickly. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid to use. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.

So, the goal is to express the P53 protein efficiently in E. coli. I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have a strong promoter, the gene should be in the correct reading frame (same as the ribosome binding site), and it should have a start codon (like ATG) at the beginning. Also, E. coli uses certain codons more frequently, so the gene should be optimized for that, but maybe that's not the main issue here.

Looking at the options, each plasmid starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's good. Now, what's the difference between the options? Let me look more carefully.

Wait, the question is about which plasmid contains the correct sequence for the Human P53 protein. So it's about matching the provided amino acid sequence to the corresponding DNA sequence in the plasmids.

But wait, the amino acid sequence is given, so I need to figure out which of the plasmids has the correct DNA coding for that sequence, considering reading frame and stop codons.

Wait, all the options are DNA sequences. Let me see: each is a long string of nucleotides. I need to see which one, when translated, matches the human P53 protein sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid must include the correct start and stop codons, and the ORF (open reading frame) must be correct.

Wait, the P53 protein's amino acid sequence starts with Met (M), which is encoded by ATG. All the options start with ATG, so that's fine.

But I might need to check the rest. Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is the correct ORF, while others have frameshifts or other issues.

Wait, looking at the options, they all start with ATG, but let's check the end. The gene should end with a stop codon. The human P53 doesn't have a stop codon in the middle; it's a single
