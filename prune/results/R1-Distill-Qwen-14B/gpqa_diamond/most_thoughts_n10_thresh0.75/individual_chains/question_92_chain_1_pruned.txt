Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Wait, enthalpy of formation... Oh right, that's the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I think I need to use bond energies here. I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products, but wait, no, that's more for reactions. Oh wait, no, actually, the standard approach is to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and formed in the products. Or wait, maybe for enthalpy of formation, I need to think in terms of the elements.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this differently. Oh, right, another method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization method. So, the enthalpy of formation of a compound is the enthalpy required to break all bonds in the compound and form all the elements, minus the enthalpy released when forming the compound's bonds from the elements.

Wait, let me think. The formula I think is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in the compound) - (sum of bond energies in the elements). Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting it backwards. Oh right, the ent
