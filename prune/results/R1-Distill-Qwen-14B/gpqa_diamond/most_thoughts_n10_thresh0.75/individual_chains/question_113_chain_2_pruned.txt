Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

First, I'll break down each spectroscopic data point.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group (-OH) or possibly a carboxylic acid or something like that. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe a carbonyl in a different environment, like an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's in the formula options here.

So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or one with a peak at 1700 and another at 1650. Wait, but the options don't all have O or O2. Let's see the options again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

If the IR shows a broad peak, let's consider that. Broad peaks could be from -OH (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or possibly from an amide, but amides are less likely here. Let's think about the other peaks. 1700 is a strong peak, which can be a carbonyl. For example, esters, ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated. So maybe there's an ester group, which has a carbonyl around 1700, and maybe another group like a conjugated double bond, but wait, the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. So maybe there's an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and an alkene nearby, causing another peak in IR? Or perhaps the compound is something like an unsaturated ester or a ketone with a double bond.

Wait, but the options include oxygen counts. Let's look at the possible formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2nOx. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 -
