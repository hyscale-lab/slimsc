Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? Lithium typically has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

So the problem is to find the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96 the speed of light. The options are all in GeV, so the answer will be in that unit.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, v is 0.96c here.

So first, I need to find gamma for v=0.96c. Then, I multiply gamma by the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, wait. The rest mass energy would be the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But since we're working in GeV, which is a unit of energy, and the mass is in atomic mass units (I think), I need to convert that correctly.

So, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Find the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons, 3 neutrons). The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, each nucleon contributes about 938 MeV in rest mass. But wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less due to binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate it using the sum of the individual masses. Or maybe the problem expects us to treat the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, each with their rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each about 938 MeV/c² each. Let me calculate that.

But wait, wait. The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So each proton is about 938.3 MeV, each neutron about 940 MeV. So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, total would be (3 * 938.3) + (3 * 939.565) MeV.

Wait, is that correct? Or should I consider that the nucleus has a mass equal to the sum of the individual nucleons' masses minus the mass defect due to binding energy? But for this problem
