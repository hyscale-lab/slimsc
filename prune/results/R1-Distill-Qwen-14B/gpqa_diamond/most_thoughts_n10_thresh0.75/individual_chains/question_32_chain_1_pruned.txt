Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

First, the question says that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons, so it's Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. Okay, so the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass I might need to calculate.

The problem is to find the energy of RHIC when the speed v of the nucleus is 0.96c. So, relativistic speed. I remember that at such speeds, we need to use the relativistic equations for energy, not the classical ones.

The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². So I need to find gamma, the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 is 7/25, so 25/7 is about 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me get exact. Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0c². For a nucleus, the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons, but considering binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can take the atomic mass and convert it into energy.

Wait, but atomic mass includes electrons. Hmm, but for a nucleus, it's protons and neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon, but wait, no, the nucleus is Li-6, which is 6 nucleons. So the mass is 6 times the mass of a proton (since Li-6 has 3 protons and
