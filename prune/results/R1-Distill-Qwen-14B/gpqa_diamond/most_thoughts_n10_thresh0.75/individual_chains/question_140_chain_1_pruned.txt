Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases substance B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B is probably a solid at that temperature.

Also, when a keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Its very close analog is also a reagent, so I'm thinking maybe something like sodium or potassium hydroxide, which are common reagents.

Let me try to figure out what X could be. If X reacts with a liquid (Y), which is probably water but maybe another liquid. When X reacts with Y, it forms gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. That sounds like H2O (water vapor), but wait, H2O would have 2 H and 1 O. Neutrons and protons: H has 0 neutrons, O has 8. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Oh, wait, the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each atom in the molecule, the number of neutrons equals the number of protons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is CH4? No, because CH4 has 6 neutrons (C has 6) and each H has 0. No, that's not equal. Or maybe CO2? CO2 has C with 6 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming 12C), and O has 8 each. No, that's not matching. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NH3? Let's calculate. N has 7 protons, each H has 1. But NH3 has 10 protons (7 + 3), and neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (for 14N), H has 0. Wait, 7 neutrons in total? Not sure.

Alternatively, the molecule could be CO? No, that's a diatomic molecule. Wait, CO has C (6 protons) and O (8 protons). The molecule would have 14 protons. The number of neutrons would be: C has 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), O has 8 (if 16O). So total neutrons would be 14. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Oh, that's possible. So CO could be the gas, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's something like H2O. Let's see: H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons each. O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 2 H (total protons 2, neutrons 0) and O (8,8). So total protons: 10, neutrons:8. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think of another approach. What if the gas is something like CH3Cl? No, that's not likely. Wait, maybe it's a noble gas. For example, Argon has 18 protons and 18 neutrons (since Ar has atomic number 18 and is usually 40Ar, which is 18 protons and 22 neutrons, that doesn't match). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and B. Wait, but then B would be something else. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, when heated, it might decompose into something else. Wait, but if the melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4°C, then B is a solid, like maybe NaOH? Wait, no, NaOH's melting point is higher, around 318 K. Hmm.

Wait, the melting point of B being near 277 K. Let me think about common substances. 277 K is approximately 4°C, so maybe B is something that's solid at that temperature, like ice? No, because ice is H2O. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? Wait, no, NaCl's melting point is much higher.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a hydroxide, which upon heating loses water or something else. For example, in the case of a carbonate: CaCO3 when heated decomposes into CaO and CO2. But
