Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me see. The setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center, because the center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity's center is s away from the conductor's center. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r < R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, they've placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are four different expressions for E, involving these variables. So I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think about what I know about conductors and electric fields. When a conductor is neutral and there's a charge inside a cavity, the charges redistribute in a specific way. Oh right, the method of images might come into play here, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Wait, in electrostatics, any excess charge on a conductor resides on the surface. But since the conductor is initially uncharged, and then a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor must respond by redistributing its charges. But since it was uncharged, how does that work?

Ah, right. When a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So if +q is inside, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have -q. But because the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. If there's +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge (inner -q, outer +q, and cavity +q) sums to zero. Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The original charge is +q inside the cavity. The conductor is neutral, so it has no net charge. The charges inside the conductor (the material) will redistribute. The inner surface must have -q, because the charge inside the cavity creates an electric field, which according to Gauss's law, induces a charge on the inner surface to cancel the field within the conductor. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the inner surface is -q, and the outer surface is +q. That way, the total charge on the conductor is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. And the cavity has +q, so the conductor's charges are -q and +q, but the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So when considering a point outside, the field should be as if the charge +q were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R, and L is the distance from the conductor's center to P. So the field at P should be due to the +q on the outer surface. And since the outer charge is distributed as a spherical shell, the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). That seems familiar; that's the same as Coulomb's law for a point charge.

Wait, but the cavity is not at the center. So the induced charges are not symmetrically placed. Oh wait, but the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So when considering the field outside the conductor, only the outer surface's charge contributes. And the outer surface's charge distribution is symmetric around the conductor's center, regardless of where the cavity is. Because the cavity is off-center, the inner charges are asymmetric, but the outer charges arrange themselves to be symmetric. Because the conductor must be an equipotential, and the outer surface's induced charge will arrange to make the overall field outside symmetric as per the conductor's center.

So the point P's electric field is just due to the +q charge on the outer surface. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B. The other options involve l and theta, but I don't think they matter because the field outside is only dependent on the distance from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but what if the charge inside the cavity is off-center? Does that affect the external field? Let's think about it. The inner surface has -q, but because the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform. But the outer surface's charge is symmetric because the conductor as a whole must have a symmetric field outside. So the external field is due to the +q on the outer shell, which is uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere.

Therefore, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the external field is the same as if the charge were at the center, and the field at P is E = k q / L², where k = 1/(4πε₀).

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) and a small positive charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at point $P$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of a neutral conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (facing the cavity) induces a charge $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, which is distributed symmetrically due to the spherical shape of the conductor.

For a spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge located at the center of the shell. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This result is independent of the offset $s$ of the cavity or the angle $\theta$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point $P$. Among the given options, this corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
