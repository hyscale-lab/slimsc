Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and each angle alpha, beta, gamma is 30 degrees. The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I think the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law, or maybe the interplanar spacing formula. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ), where (l m n) are the Miller indices, right? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, no, perhaps the general formula is different. Oh wait, the formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by d = (a^2 (l m n)) / (sqrt( (l^2 + m^2 + n^2) - (l(m + n) cos α) ... )) No, wait, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should think about the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me remember. For a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but in non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, the formula is more complicated. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

Wait, but wait, I think the cos terms are for the angles between the axes. In a rhombohedral system, all angles are the same, alpha = beta = gamma. So in this case, each angle is 30 degrees.

So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

But wait, I think the formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors, which in rhombohedral is given as gamma, but maybe I should think about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the lattice vectors and the reciprocal basis.

Wait, I
