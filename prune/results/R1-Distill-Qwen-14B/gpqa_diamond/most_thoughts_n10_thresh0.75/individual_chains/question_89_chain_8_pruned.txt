Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to unpack each part carefully.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The dibromo substitution is on the 1 and 3 positions. When heated with KOH, especially in excess, I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably eliminating HBr. But wait, since it's dibromo, maybe it's a double elimination. So the product would have a double bond.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum shows specific peaks. Let me think about the NMR data. The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Oh, and there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. That IR peak is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester. But considering the reaction conditions, which is KOH and heat, it's more likely an elimination forming a double bond, but where's the carbonyl coming from?

Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination isn't just forming a double bond but is forming a carbonyl. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: heating with KOH could lead to a double elimination, forming an alkene, but how does that give a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically gives alkenes. Wait, maybe the structure after elimination has a carbonyl group because the elimination leads to a ring formation with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is used, especially in a high temperature, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of two bromides, forming a double bond. But if the molecule is symmetric, maybe the double bond forms in a way that creates a bridgehead double bond, which is allowed. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so bridgehead double bonds are possible under certain conditions.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group. So maybe the elimination isn't just forming a double bond but a ketone. How? Oh, wait, maybe each elimination step is dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is removed, and the adjacent C becomes a carbonyl. Wait, if two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgeheads, maybe elimination would lead to a ring contraction or expansion, creating a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an epoxide? No, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent for that. Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone.
