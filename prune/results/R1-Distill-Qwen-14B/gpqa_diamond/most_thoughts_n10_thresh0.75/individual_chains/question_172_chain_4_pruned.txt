Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights and ΔE is the energy difference. But wait, since the question is about excitation, I think they're comparing the populations of two energy levels.

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Let's denote the excitation as being in an upper energy level. So for star_1, let's say N1_upper is twice N2_upper. But wait, because the ratio is given, maybe it's better to model it as (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = something, and (N2_upper)/(N2_lower) = something else. But the key is that the ratio between the two stars is given as 2.

Wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are "twice as excited" as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio of the excited state population (upper level) to the ground state (lower level) is higher in star_1. So (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower). Hmm, but wait, let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's that for both stars, each is in LTE, so for each, the ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is N1_upper / N1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and similarly for star 2, it's N2_upper / N2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star
