Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states based on temperature.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. So the excitation level is twice as much. That probably relates to the ratio of populations of two energy states.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's 1.38 times 10^-23 joules. Wait a second, 1.38 is also the approximate value of the Boltzmann constant k in J/K. So maybe that's a clue. Because the Boltzmann constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K, so the energy difference ΔE here is equal to k multiplied by some temperature? No, wait, no. I think the energy difference is already given, so the ratio of populations is what we're after.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to e^(-ΔE/(k*T)). So if we have two stars, star_1 and star_2, their temperatures T1 and T2 will affect this ratio.

In star_1, the number of excited atoms (n1) is twice that in star_2 (n2). Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. Wait, but the question is about the population ratio. So the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is compared to n2_upper / n2_lower.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe that means that the excitation (the number in the higher state) is twice as much. So
