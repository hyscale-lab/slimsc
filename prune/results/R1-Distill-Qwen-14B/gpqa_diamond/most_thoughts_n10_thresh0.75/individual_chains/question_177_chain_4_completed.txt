Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Okay, we're dealing with the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. 

The given information is that Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Same goes for their masses—Star 1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star 2. Interesting. The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Also, the radial velocities are given: Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star 2 is moving at 700 km/s. 

The problem states that the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, and we have to find that factor. The options are A to D, with numbers around 2.2 to 2.35. 

Hmm. So, to approach this, I think I should start by recalling the formulas related to blackbody radiation and luminosity. The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K), and T is the effective temperature of the star. 

Since the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. Because b is a constant, so λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2, right? 

Wait a second, but wait. What about Doppler shift? Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would shift. Oh, right! The radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength. Oh, but wait the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same. 

So, I need to factor in the Doppler effect here. Because Star 2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s (radial velocity), its observed wavelength would be blueshifted. That would mean that the observed λ_max for Star 2 is shorter than its actual emitted λ_max. But since both observed λ_max are the same, the Doppler shift must adjust for the temperature difference. 

Wait, maybe I should think about this more carefully. Let me denote the actual (intrinsic) temperature of Star 2 as T2, and Star 1 as T1. But because Star 2 is moving, the observed temperature would be different. 

The Doppler effect for light is given by the relativistic formula, but since velocities are given in km/s, perhaps non-relativistic approximation is better. The Doppler shift formula in terms of wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light. But wait, this is the non-relativistic approximation. So the observed wavelength λ_observed is λ0*(1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive when moving away (redshift) and negative when moving towards (blueshift). 

In this case, Star 2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Since radial velocity is 700, I think that's the velocity towards us. Wait, the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So Star_1 has v_r =0, Star_2 has v_r =700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving towards us. So for Star_2, observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 - v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s. Because when a source moves towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so λ_obs = λ_source * (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)? Wait, wait, no, I think the non-relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_source * (1 + v_r / c), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is: λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when moving towards, but that's the relativistic formula. Alternatively, the non-relativistic (approximate) formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, v_r is negative. So the observed wavelength is shorter. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c) where v_r is negative in that case. 

Wait, maybe it's better to write the exact Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is λ = λ_0 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta = v/c. But if the velocities are small compared to c, we can approximate this. 

Alternatively, the approximate formula is λ = λ0 (1 + v/c) when moving away (v positive), and λ = λ0 (1 - v/c) when moving towards. No, wait, I think I got that inverted. Because if a source is moving towards you, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs < λ_emit. So, the formula should be λ_obs = λ_emit (1 - v/c), if v is towards the observer. But wait, I've seen the formula written as λ_obs = λ_emit (1 + v/c) for when the source is moving away. So, if v is negative (moving towards), then λ_obs = λ_emit (1 - |v|/c) — because (1 + (-|v|/c)) = 1 - |v|/c.

But in any case, the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 - v2/c), since it's moving towards us. 

But the problem states that both observed λ_max are the same. So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

But Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so λ1_obs = λ1_emit. 

So, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 - v2/c) 

But from Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T. So, λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2. 

So, substituting: 

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c) 

The b's cancel out: 

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 - v2/c) 

Which gives T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c) 

Wait, because if I rearrange:

1/T1 = (1 - v2/c) / T2 → T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c) 

But since v2 is 700 km/s, which is 700,000 m/s, and c is about 3e8 m/s. So v2/c is 7e5 / 3e8 = approximately 0.002333. So 1 - v2/c is about 0.9976667. So T1 is T2 divided by 0.9976667, which is about 1.00234 times T2. So T1 is a bit hotter than T2. 

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute v2/c. 

v2 = 700,000 m/s (since 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s). 

c = 3e8 m/s. 

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = (7/3) * 1e-3 = approximately 0.00233333.

So 1 - v2/c = 1 - 0.00233333 = 0.99766667.

So T1 = T2 / 0.99766667 → T1 ≈ T2 * 1.00234. 

So T1 is about 0.234% hotter than T2. 

But this might be a small effect. Hmm. But let's proceed.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, the luminosity ratio L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) 

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, and from before, T1 ≈ (1 / (1 - v2/c)) T2. 

So R1² = (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2².

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c) → T1 = T2 * [1 + (v2/c) + (v2/c)^2 + ... ] ≈ T2 (1 + v2/(c)) for small v2/c. But maybe it's better to proceed exactly.

So T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c) → T1^4 = T2^4 / (1 - v2/c)^4. 

So L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * [ T2^4 / (1 - v2/c)^4 T2^4 ] 

Wait, wait no. Let me correct that. 

Wait, R1 is 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². 

T1^4 is (T2 / (1 - v2/c))^4. So (T1^4) = (T2^4) / (1 - v2/c)^4.

So putting it all together: 

L1/L2 = [ (2.25 R2²) * (T2^4) / (1 - v2/c)^4 ) ] / [ (R2²) * (T2^4) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (2.25 R2² T2^4) / (1 - v2/c)^4 

Denominator: R2² T2^4 

So L1/L2 = [ 2.25 / (1 - v2/c)^4 ] 

Because R2² and T2^4 cancel out. 

So now, compute 1 - v2/c = 0.99766667. 

So (1 - v2/c)^4 = (0.99766667)^4. Let's compute that.

Compute 0.99766667^4.

Let me compute it step by step. 

First, compute 0.99766667 squared.

0.99766667 × 0.99766667 ≈ 

Well, 1 - 0.00233333.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a² where a=0.00233333.

So 1 - 2*(0.00233333) + (0.00233333)^2.

Which is 1 - 0.00466666 + 0.00000544444.

≈ 0.99533378.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 0.99766667 × 0.99766667 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.99766667 × 0.99766667:

Approximately,

(0.99766667)^2 = (approx) 0.99766667 * 0.99766667 

= Let me compute 1000000 parts: 997666.67 * 997666.67 → but perhaps it's easier to compute as:

= (1 - 0.00233333)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00233333) + (0.00233333)^2.

= 1 - 0.00466666 + 0.00000544444 

≈ 0.99533378444.

So (0.99766667)^2 ≈ 0.9953337844.

Then, to compute (0.99766667)^4, square that result.

So 0.9953337844 squared is:

Again, using (1 - a)^2 where a=0.0046662156.

Wait, 0.9953337844 is 1 - 0.0046662156.

So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a².

a = 0.0046662156 → 2a = 0.0093324312 → a² ≈ 0.0046662156^2 ≈ 0.00002177.

So:

1 - 0.0093324312 + 0.00002177 ≈ 0.99068934.

So (0.99766667)^4 ≈ 0.99068934.

But let me compute it more accurately, perhaps with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using logarithms or exponents, but maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, but let me think of it this way: the denominator is (0.99766667)^4 ≈ 0.9906893.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.9906893 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 divided by 0.9906893.

So 2.25 / 0.9906893.

Well, 2.25 / 0.99 is approximately 2.2727 (since 0.99 × 2.2727 ≈ 2.25). 

But since the denominator is 0.9906893, which is a bit larger than 0.99, so the result will be a bit less than 2.2727.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute denominator: 0.9906893.

So 2.25 divided by 0.9906893.

Hmm, 0.9906893 is approximately 0.9906893.

Let me compute 2.25 / 0.9906893.

Alternatively, compute 2.25 × (1 / 0.9906893).

1/0.9906893 ≈ 1.0094.

Because 0.9906893 × 1.0094 ≈ 1.

So 2.25 × 1.0094 ≈ 2.25 × 1.0094 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.0094 = 0.02115

So total is approximately 2.25 + 0.02115 = 2.27115.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.27115.

Looking at the options, option B is ~2.32, option C is ~2.35, option D is ~2.23, and A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Because (0.99766667)^4 is approximately 0.9906893, as I calculated.

So the ratio L1/L2 is 2.25 / 0.9906893 ≈ 2.271. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is ~2.23, but wait, 2.27 isn't exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me recheck the earlier steps.

Wait, another approach: since v2 is 700 km/s, which is significant compared to the speed of light? Let me compute v2 in terms of c.

700,000 m/s / 3e8 m/s = 7e5 / 3e8 = (7/3) * 1e-3 → approximately 0.00233333 c. So, 0.2333% of the speed of light.

So (1 - v2/c) is 0.997666667.

So (1 - v2/c)^4 is 0.997666667^4.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 0.997666667^2:

= (0.997666667) * (0.997666667)

= Let me compute 0.9976 * 0.9976.

But perhaps a better way is to use the binomial expansion for (1 - a)^n where a is small.

Wait, a = 0.00233333.

So (1 - a)^4 ≈ 1 -4a + 6a² -4a³ + a^4.

a = 0.00233333

a^2 = 0.00233333^2 ≈ 5.4444e-6.

a^3 ≈ 1.2667e-8.

a^4 ≈ 3.000e-11.

So,

1 -4a = 1 - 4*(0.00233333) = 1 -0.00933332 = 0.99066668.

+6a² → 6 *5.4444e-6 ≈ 3.2666e-5 → 0.99066668 + 0.000032666 ≈ 0.990699346.

-4a^3 → 4 *1.2667e-8 = 5.0668e-8 → subtract that: 0.990699346 - 0.000000050668 ≈ 0.990699295.

+ a^4 → 3e-11 → negligible. So approximately 0.9906993.

So (1 - a)^4 ≈ 0.9906993.

So denominator is 0.9906993.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.9906993 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 0.9906993.

Let's compute 0.9906993 * 2.27 = ?

0.9906993 * 2 = 1.9813986

0.9906993 * 0.27 = approx 0.2675388.

So total ≈ 1.9813986 + 0.2675388 = 2.2489374.

Which is approximately 2.2489, which is just under 2.25. So 2.2489 is less than 2.25, meaning that 2.25 / 0.9906993 is approximately 2.27. 

Wait, but 0.9906993 * 2.27 = 2.2489374, which is just under 2.25. So 2.25 / 0.9906993 is approximately 2.27. So L1/L2 is about 2.27.

Looking back at the options: 

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.27 isn't exactly any of them, but the closest is option B (~2.32) or option D (~2.23). Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the luminosity ratio.

Another approach: since Star_2 has a radial velocity, its observed temperature is different. So when we calculate the luminosity, do we use the intrinsic temperature, or the observed one? Because the problem says the stars are radiating as black bodies, but their observed wavelengths are the same. So for the purpose of calculating luminosity, which temperature do we use?

Wait, no. The luminosity is an intrinsic property, so we should use the actual temperatures, not the observed ones. Oh wait, but we are told that the stars are radiating as black bodies, but the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same, which includes Doppler shifts.

So for each star, the observed λ_max = λ_emit * Doppler factor.

But the actual emitted λ_max is determined by their actual temperatures. So, for Star 1, λ1_emit = b / T1.

For Star 2, λ2_emit = b / T2.

But observed λ_max for Star 1 is λ1_emit, because its radial velocity is zero. Observed λ_max for Star 2 is λ2_emit * (1 - v2/c). 

Since the observed λ_max are the same, λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 - v2/c).

Which gives T1 = [ (1 - v2/c) * T2 ]^{-1} * b → wait, no, using λ_max = b/T.

So, λ1_emit = (b / T1), λ2_emit_observed = λ2_emit * (1 - v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c).

Since λ1_emit = λ2_emit_observed, because their observed λ_max is same.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 - v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 - v2/c)

→ T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c)

Which brings us back to the same equation as before.

So, T1 = T2 / (1 - 0.00233333) ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

So, the temperature of Star 1 is a bit higher than Star 2. So when calculating their luminosities, we must include this. 

Thus, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 ) / (R2² T2^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1² = 2.25 R2².

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c) → T1^4 = T2^4 / (1 - v2/c)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2²) * [ T2^4 / (1 - v2/c)^4 T2^4 ] / (R2²) → the R2² and T2^4 cancel.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 - v2/c)^4.

As before, (1 - v2/c)^4 is approximately 0.9906993.

So, 2.25 / 0.9906993 ≈ 2.271.

Looking back at the options, none of them is exactly 2.271, but the closest is option B (2.32), but wait let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the denominator more accurately, perhaps using more precise exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift effect. Let me think again about the Doppler formula.

Wait, another approach: the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Wait, but when the source is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ).

Wait, but that's the relativistic Doppler shift. So, using that, let's compute again.

Given that Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s towards us. So beta = v/c = 700e3 / 3e8 = 0.002333333.

So, lambda_obs for Star_2 is lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

= lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - 0.002333333)/(1 + 0.002333333) )

Compute the numerator and denominator inside the square root:

1 - 0.002333333 = 0.997666667

1 + 0.002333333 = 1.002333333

So, (0.997666667)/(1.002333333) = approximately 0.99536743.

Take the square root: sqrt(0.99536743) ≈ 0.997683.

So, lambda_obs = lambda_2_emit * 0.997683.

But since Star_1 has zero velocity, its lambda_1_emit = lambda_obs.

So,

lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit * 0.997683 → lambda_2_emit = lambda_1_emit / 0.997683.

But from Wien's law, lambda_max = b / T.

So,

lambda_1_emit = b / T1 → T1 = b / lambda_1_emit.

lambda_2_emit = b / T2 → T2 = b / lambda_2_emit.

But lambda_2_emit = lambda_1_emit / 0.997683.

So,

T2 = b / (lambda_1_emit / 0.997683) ) = (b * 0.997683) / lambda_1_emit = 0.997683 * (b / lambda_1_emit) ) = 0.997683 T1.

So T1 = T2 / 0.997683 → T1 = T2 * (1/0.997683) ≈ T2 * 1.00234.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 1/0.997683.

1 / 0.997683 ≈ 1.00234.

So T1 is approximately 1.00234 T2.

So the temperature ratio T1/T2 ≈ 1.00234.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is:

( R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) * (T1^4) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2^2) * ( (T2 * 1.00234)^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

R2^2 cancels, T2^4 cancels.

So,

= 2.25 * (1.00234)^4.

Compute (1.00234)^4.

Let me compute this step by step.

(1.00234)^2 = 1.00234 * 1.00234.

Compute 1.00234 * 1.00234:

= 1.004704 (approximate, but let's compute more accurately.)

1.00234 * 1.00234:

= (1 + 0.00234)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.00234) + (0.00234)^2 → 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756 → ≈1.0046855.

Then, (1.0046855)^2 → let's compute this.

1.0046855 * 1.0046855.

Approximated as:

= (1 + 0.0046855)^2 → 1 + 2*0.0046855 + (0.0046855)^2.

= 1 + 0.009371 + 0.00002195 → ≈1.00939295.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009393.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009393 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009393.

Compute 2.25 × 1.009393:

= 2.25 * 1 = 2.25

+ 2.25 * 0.009393 = ~0.0211.

So total ≈ 2.25 + 0.0211 = 2.2711.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.271.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option B (~2.32) is a bit higher. Option D is ~2.23, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe this suggests that I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps in the Doppler shift.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the Doppler effect step. Because when using the relativistic Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is shorter, so lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) → which for beta=0.002333, gives sqrt( (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ) = sqrt(0.9953674) ≈ 0.997683.

So lambda_obs = lambda_emit * 0.997683.

Wait, but since Star 2's observed lambda is equal to Star 1's, which is lambda_1_emit.

So, lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit * 0.997683.

This implies lambda_2_emit = lambda_1_emit / 0.997683 ≈ lambda_1_emit * 1.00234.

Which gives T2 = b / lambda_2_emit = b / (lambda_1_emit * 1.00234) → T2 = T1 / 1.00234 → T2 = 0.997683 T1.

So T1 = T2 / 0.997683 → approximately 1.00234 T2.

But wait, earlier calculation using the non-relativistic Doppler shift gave T1 = T2 * 1.00234 as well. So, this part is consistent.

So, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * (1.00234)^4 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00939 → ~2.271.

Hmm. But the options don't have this. So is it possible that I missed something else?

Wait, the problem says the stars have the same observed wavelength. Did I account for that correctly in terms of temperature?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the effective temperatures and Doppler shifts again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the fact that the observed wavelength is the same for both stars. So, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit_observed.

So, lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Wait, no, wait: the relativistic Doppler shift is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) when the source is moving towards the observer.

So, for Star_2, moving towards us, lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Given that lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_obs → lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, lambda_2_emit = lambda_1_emit / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

= lambda_1_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

lambda_2_emit = lambda_1_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which makes sense, because if the source is moving towards us, the emitted wavelength is longer than the observed.

Wait, but wait, no. If the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so the emitted wavelength must be longer. So yes, lambda_2_emit is longer than lambda_2_obs.

Now, using Wien's law, lambda_1_emit = b / T1, lambda_2_emit = b / T2.

So,

lambda_1_emit = lambda_2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Substituting,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is the same as T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

beta = v/c = 0.00233333.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1.0023333)/(0.99766667) ≈ 1.0047092.

Taking the square root gives approximately 1.00235.

So,

T1 = T2 * 1.00235.

So, T1/T2 ≈ 1.00235.

Now, compute (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00235)^4.

As before, (1.00235)^2 ≈ 1.00471.

Then, (1.00471)^2 ≈ 1.00946.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.00946.

So, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * 1.00946 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00946 ≈ 2.271.

So, approximately 2.271.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option D (2.23) but that's lower than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options have been rounded, and the correct answer is approximately 2.27, which isn't exactly any of the options, but the closest is option B (~2.32), but that's a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, in the calculation of (1.00235)^4, I get 1.00946. So 2.25 * 1.00946 is 2.271.

Looking at the options again:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, 2.27 isn't exactly any of them. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the Doppler factor.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift in terms of temperature is different. Let me think again. Because when the star is moving towards us, the observed temperature is higher. So maybe I should have considered that the observed temperature is higher for Star_2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the observed peak wavelengths are the same, so their observed temperatures are the same. Because T_obs = b / lambda_obs.

So, for Star_1, T1_obs = b / lambda1_emit.

For Star_2, T2_obs = b / lambda2_obs.

But lambda1_emit = lambda2_obs → T1_obs = T2_obs.

So, if the observed temperatures are the same, then the Doppler shift must make the observed temperatures equal.

So, perhaps I should use the observed temperatures in the luminosity calculation.

Wait, no. Because luminosity depends on the intrinsic temperature, not the observed. Unless the problem is telling us that the observed lambda_max is the same, which implies that the observed temperatures are the same.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

The luminosity of a star is an intrinsic property, so it's based on the star's actual temperature and radius. The observed temperature (as perceived from Earth) would be affected by the Doppler shift. So when we calculate L, we must use the intrinsic T, not the observed T. But the problem states that the observed lambda_max (which affects the observed T) are the same. Thus, the intrinsic Ts are related by the Doppler shift.

So, to compute L1 and L2, we need to use the intrinsic Ts, which are related via the Doppler shift.

But regardless, the earlier approach seems correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is implying that the stars emit at the same wavelength, but when considering their velocities, the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but their observed are same.

So, for Star 1: lambda1_emit = lambda_obs.

For Star 2: lambda2_emit * (1 - v2/c) = lambda_obs.

So, lambda2_emit = lambda_obs / (1 - v2/c).

But according to Wien's law, lambda1_emit = b / T1, lambda2_emit = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = lambda_obs → T1 = b / lambda_obs.

b/T2 = lambda_obs / (1 - v2/c) → T2 = b (1 - v2/c) / lambda_obs.

So,

T1 = b / lambda_obs.

T2 = (b (1 - v2/c)) / lambda_obs.

Thus,

T1 = T2 / (1 - v2/c).

Which brings us back to the same conclusion as before.

So, the earlier calculation holds, leading to L1/L2 ≈ 2.27, which isn't exactly any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.00234)^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (1.00234)^4:

First, compute (1.00234)^2.

1.00234 × 1.00234:

= 1 + 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2.

= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756.

= 1.0046854756.

Now, compute (1.0046854756)^2.

= (1 + 0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 2*0.0046854756 + (0.0046854756)^2.

= 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.000021951.

= 1.0093929022.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0093929.

Thus, 2.25 × 1.0093929 = ?

2.25 × 1 = 2.25.

2.25 × 0.0093929 = 0.021100575.

So total is 2.25 + 0.021100575 = 2.271100575.

So, 2.2711.

Looking at the options, it's not exactly any, but perhaps the options are approximations. Option B is ~2.32, which is higher. Option D is ~2.23, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I should use the Doppler formula correctly. When a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so the observed temperature is higher. So the observed temperature of Star_2 is higher than its intrinsic temperature. But the observed temperatures of both stars are the same.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, their observed temperatures are the same, because T = b / lambda.

So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

So, T_obs1 = T1 (since v1=0).

T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c), because when a star moves towards us, the observed temperature is higher.

Wait, wait, that might be a different approach. Because the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for temperature (assuming non-relativistic) is T_obs = T_emit * (1 + v_r/c).

Because when a star moves towards us, the observed temperature is higher.

So, T_obs1 = T1 (since v1=0).

T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

Since T_obs1 = T_obs2,

T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's a different approach. Because earlier, I considered the observed lambda, which relates to T via Wien's law. But perhaps it's more straightforward to use the Doppler effect on temperature.

So, if the observed temperatures are the same, then T_obs = T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

Because for Star_2, moving towards us, T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

So, v2 is 700 km/s, so v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.00233333.

So, (1 + v2/c) = 1.00233333.

Thus, T1 = T2 * 1.00233333.

Then, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1/T2 is 1.00233333.

So,

(1.00233333)^4 ≈ ?

Compute (1.00233333)^2 = 1.00467.

Then, (1.00467)^2 = approximately 1.00938.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00938 ≈ 2.2711.

Same result as before.

So, the ratio is approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options again, none exactly match. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but considering the options, the closest is option D (~2.23) but that's lower than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me think, perhaps I should compute (1.00233333)^4 more accurately.

Compute 1.00233333^4:

Compute step by step.

First, 1.00233333^2.

= 1.00233333 * 1.00233333.

= 1 + 2*(0.00233333) + (0.00233333)^2 → 1 + 0.00466666 + 0.00000544 → 1.00467209.

Wait, wait, that's not accurate. Let me compute 1.00233333 * 1.00233333.

Let me think of it as 1.00233333 * 1.00233333.

= (1 + 0.00233333)^2 = 1^2 + 2*1*0.00233333 + (0.00233333)^2.

= 1 + 0.00466666 + 0.000005444.

= 1.004672104.

So, (1.00233333)^2 ≈ 1.004672104.

Now, compute (1.004672104)^2.

= (1 + 0.004672104)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.004672104) + (0.004672104)^2.

= 1 + 0.009344208 + 0.000021828.

= 1.009366036.

So, (1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1.009366.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009366 = ?

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009366 = 0.021129.

So, total ≈ 2.25 + 0.021129 = 2.271129.

So, about 2.2711.

But the options don't have this exact value. However, option D is ~2.23, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the Doppler shift effect, but that can't be right because the problem explicitly gives the radial velocities.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is negligible, but in this case, it's about 0.23% which might not be entirely negligible, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore it, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the Doppler shift in a different way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature ratio is T1 / T2 = (1 + v1/c) / (1 + v2/c), but since Star_1's v is zero, T1_obs = T2_obs * (1 + v2/c). Because Star_2 is moving towards us, so its observed temperature is higher, which must match Star_1's observed temperature.

Wait, that's possible. Let's see.

If T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But T_obs1 = T1 (since v1=0).

T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c), because when moving towards, observed frequency increases, so temperature (which is proportional to frequency) increases.

So T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

So,

T1 = T2 * 1.00233333.

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1.00233333)^4 = 2.25 * 1.009366 ≈ 2.271.

Again, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift, but that's not justifiable. But if we ignore it, then T1 = T2, and L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 → option A.

But the problem gives radial velocities, so the Doppler shift must be considered. So the intended answer is probably option B (~2.32), but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent. Let me recompute (1.00233333)^4.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculation:

Compute (1.00233333)^4.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 1.00233333^1 = 1.00233333.

1.00233333^2 = 1.00233333 * 1.00233333.

Compute as:

1.00233333 * 1.00233333:

= 1 * 1.00233333 + 0.00233333 * 1.00233333.

= 1.00233333 + 0.002338.

= 1.00467133.

Wait, that's more precise.

Then, 1.00467133^2.

= (1 + 0.00467133)^2.

= 1^2 + 2*1*(0.00467133) + (0.00467133)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934266 + 0.00002182.

= 1.00936448.

So, (1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1.00936448.

Thus, 2.25 * 1.00936448 = ?

2.25 * 1.00936448.

Compute 2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.00936448 = 0.02112764.

Total is 2.25 + 0.02112764 = 2.27112764.

So, about 2.2711.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 2.27, which isn't among the options. But looking at the options again:

A) ~2.25 → 2.25 is less than our calculation.

B) ~2.32 → 2.32 is higher.

C) ~2.35 → higher.

D) ~2.23 → lower.

Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the initial assumption. For example, perhaps the Doppler shift should be applied differently. Oh! Wait, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, but the problem states radial velocities of 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_2 is moving towards us, which blueshifts its light, making its observed wavelength shorter. But since both observed wavelengths are the same, Star_1 must have a longer intrinsic wavelength, which would imply a lower temperature. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Let me think.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength is shorter than its emitted wavelength. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which is stationary, Star_2's emitted wavelength must be longer than Star_1's. Because when you blueshift, lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 - v/c), so lambda_emit = lambda_obs / (1 - v/c).

So, if lambda_obs is same for both, lambda_2_emit = lambda_obs / (1 - v2/c), which is longer than lambda_obs, because denominator is <1.

So, Star_2's emitted wavelength is longer than Star_1's. So, using Wien's law, T2 = b / lambda_2_emit.

Which would make T2 < T1, because lambda_2_emit > lambda_1_emit → T2 = b/lambda_2_emit < b/lambda_1_emit = T1.

So, this supports the earlier conclusion that T1 > T2.

Thus, the calculation seems correct, but the options don't have an exact match. Perhaps the intended answer is option D, ~2.23, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift factor for luminosity is (1 + v/c), but I applied it as (1 - v/c). Let me think. Oh wait, no, because the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so the observed temperature is higher. So if T_obs is same for both, then T1 must be higher than T2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's compute T_obs for both stars.

Star_1: no velocity, so T_obs1 = T1.

Star_2: moving towards us, so T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

Given that T_obs1 = T_obs2.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c) → T1 = T2 * 1.00233333.

Thus, the same as before.

So, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * (1.00233333)^4 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended us to ignore the Doppler shift. If so, then T1 = T2, and L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 → option A. But the problem gives radial velocities, so this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler factor. Let me recompute (1.00233333)^4 accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

(1.00233333)^2 = 1.00467209.

(1.00467209)^2 = ?

Compute 1.00467209 × 1.00467209.

Compute step by step:

1.00467209 × 1 = 1.00467209.

1.00467209 × 0.004 = 0.004018688.

1.00467209 × 0.0006 = 0.000602803.

1.00467209 × 0.00007 = 0.000070327.

1.00467209 × 0.000002 = 0.000002009.

Add them up:

1.00467209 + 0.004018688 = 1.00869078.

+ 0.000602803 → 1.00929358.

+ 0.000070327 → 1.00936391.

+ 0.000002009 → 1.00936592.

So, (1.00467209)^2 ≈ 1.00936592.

So,

(1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1.00936592.

Thus,

2.25 × 1.00936592 = 2.27112682.

So, approximately 2.271.

Hmm.

Given the options, none match exactly. However, perhaps the intended answer is option B, ~2.32, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be considered in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Doppler shift in terms of the star's luminosity as observed. But no, the luminosity is an intrinsic property. So I think the calculations are correct.

But perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the observed temperatures, not the intrinsic ones, leading to a different ratio. Let's see.

If observed temperatures are same, then T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But T_obs1 = T1 (since v1=0).

T_obs2 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 + v2/c).

So,

T1/T2 = 1.00233333.

Thus, the same as before.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. The calculated ratio is approximately 2.27, but the options don't have this. Perhaps the intended answer is option D, ~2.23, but I can't see why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be ignored, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25, option A.

But that doesn't make sense given the information provided about the radial velocities. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but if I have to choose the closest, option D is ~2.23, which is a bit lower than 2.27. Alternatively, perhaps a calculation mistake exists.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2.25 / (1 - v2/c)^4 more accurately using the precise value of (1 - v2/c).

v2/c is 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) → 0.02333333333.

Wait, wait, Wait a minute! Wait, 700,000 m/s is 700 km/s. So 700e3 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s is 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) → 0.00233333333.

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake here in an earlier calculation. Because 700,000 / 3e8 is 7e5 / 3e8 = (7/3) * 1e-3 → which is 0.00233333333.

So, 1 - v2/c = 0.9976666667.

So, (0.9976666667)^4.

Wait, let me compute (0.9976666667)^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.9976666667^2.

= 0.9976666667 * 0.9976666667 = ?

Let me compute:

0.9976666667 × 0.9976666667.

= (1 - 0.00233333333) × (1 - 0.00233333333).

= 1 - 2*0.00233333333 + (0.00233333333)^2.

= 1 - 0.00466666666 + 0.00000544444.

= 0.9953387778.

So, 0.9976666667^2 = 0.9953387778.

Now, compute (0.9953387778)^2.

= 0.9953387778 * 0.9953387778.

= Let me compute:

= (1 - 0.0046612222) * (1 - 0.0046612222).

= 1 - 2*0.0046612222 + (0.0046612222)^2.

= 1 - 0.0093224444 + 0.0000217333.

= 0.9906992889.

So, (0.9976666667)^4 ≈ 0.9906992889.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 0.9906992889 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 0.9906992889.

Let me do this division accurately.

Compute 0.9906992889 × 2.27 → approximately 2.25.

Because 0.9906992889 × 2.27 ≈ 2.25 (since earlier calculation showed 2.27 gives 2.2489374, which is very close to 2.25).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can compute 2.25 / 0.9906992889.

Let me compute 2.25 / 0.9906992889.

Compute 0.9906992889 × 2.27 = ?

0.9906992889 × 2 = 1.981398578.

0.9906992889 × 0.27 = 0.267538808.

Total = 1.981398578 + 0.267538808 = 2.248937386.

Which is very close to 2.25. So, 0.9906992889 × 2.27 ≈ 2.248937386, which is just slightly less than 2.25.

Thus, 2.25 / 0.9906992889 ≈ 2.27.

So, the ratio is approximately 2.27.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, ~2.23, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to ignore the Doppler shift effect, in which case, the luminosity ratio would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that would imply that the given radial velocities are irrelevant to the problem, which seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to give the same observed wavelengths, which includes Doppler shifts, but the approach to calculate the luminosity ratio is different.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity is based on the observed flux, but no, the problem states that the stars are radiating as black bodies, and we're to compute their luminosities.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the calculations, the correct ratio is approximately 2.27, but the options don't include this. The closest option is D) ~2.23, but it's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B) ~2.32.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 2.25 / (0.9906992889) more accurately.

Compute 2.25 / 0.9906992889.

Let me write it as 2.25 ÷ 0.9906992889.

Using a calculator approach:

We can compute it as:

0.9906992889 × 2.27 = 2.248937386.

Which is 2.248937386, which is less than 2.25 by about 0.001062614.

So, the difference is 0.001062614.

To find how much more than 2.27 we need to get to 2.25.

Let me compute:

Let x = 2.27 + d.

So,

0.9906992889 × (2.27 + d) = 2.25.

We have 0.9906992889 × 2.27 = 2.248937386.

So,

2.248937386 + 0.9906992889 × d = 2.25.

Subtract 2.248937386 from both sides:

0.9906992889 × d = 0.001062614.

So,

d = 0.001062614 / 0.9906992889 ≈ 0.0010725.

So, x ≈ 2.27 + 0.0010725 ≈ 2.2710725.

So, 2.25 / 0.9906992889 ≈ 2.27107.

Thus, the ratio is approximately 2.271.

So, perhaps the answer is option D, which is ~2.23, but that's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B, ~2.32, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct answer is 'A) ~2.25', but that would ignore the Doppler shift. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation and the correct ratio is 2.32.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift affects the observed luminosity, but that's not correct because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be considered, leading to option B. But without a precise match, it's unclear.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the correct ratio is approximately 2.27, which isn't listed. But among the given options, the closest is option D (~2.23), but it's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B (~2.32), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation of the Doppler factor has an error. Let me compute (1 - v2/c) again.

v2 = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

v2/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.002333333333.

So, 1 - v2/c = 0.9976666667.

Compute (0.9976666667)^4.

Earlier, I computed it as approximately 0.9906992889.

But perhaps more accurately, let me compute it.

Compute (0.9976666667)^2 = 0.9953387778.

Then, (0.9953387778)^2.

= 0.9953387778 * 0.9953387778.

Compute step by step:

0.9953387778 × 0.9953387778.

= (1 - 0.0046612222) × (1 - 0.0046612222).

= 1 - 2×0.0046612222 + (0.0046612222)^2.

= 1 - 0.0093224444 + 0.0000217333.

= 0.9906992889.

Thus, (0.9976666667)^4 = 0.9906992889.

So, 2.25 / 0.9906992889 = approx 2.271.

I think this is correct, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, ~2.32, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round to the nearest option, which would be option D, but I think the correct approach leads to approximately 2.27.

Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be considered in a different way. For example, perhaps the observed wavelengths being the same implies that the intrinsic temperatures are the same, which would mean that T1 = T2, leading to L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 → option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler shift, which seems incorrect given the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the correct answer isn't listed. But in the absence of that, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is option D) ~2.23, but that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem switched the stars. Suppose Star_2 has a larger radius and mass, but the given data says Star_1 has 1.5 times radius and mass. Hmm, no, the question says Star_1 has radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer based on calculations is approximately 2.27, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32. Alternatively, the intended answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not sure.


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) for the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the effective temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the Temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)) of the two stars are the same. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant, the observed wavelengths are related to the intrinsic temperatures and the Doppler shift due to radial velocity.

For Star 2, moving toward the observer with a radial velocity \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is blueshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = v_2 / c \). Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we find:

\[
\beta = \frac{700 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.002333
\]

The observed wavelengths for both stars are the same, so:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}}
\]

For Star 1 (no radial velocity), \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} \). For Star 2:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Equating the two:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Substituting \( \beta = 0.002333 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.002333}{1 - 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.00235
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot 1.00235
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Ratio
The radius of Star 1 is \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
\]

The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.00235 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.00235)^4
\]

Using the binomial expansion for small \( \beta \), \( (1 + \beta)^4 \approx 1 + 4\beta \), we approximate:

\[
(1.00235)^4 \approx 1 + 4 \cdot 0.00235 = 1.0094
\]

Thus, the luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \cdot 1.0094 \approx 2.271
\]

### Step 3: Comparing with Options
The calculated luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \approx 2.271 \) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is:

- **A) ~2.25**: This is lower than the calculated value.
- **B) ~2.32**: This is higher than the calculated value.
- **C) ~2.35**: This is significantly higher than the calculated value.
- **D) ~2.23**: This is lower than the calculated value.

Given the options, the closest match is **D) ~2.23**, but it is slightly lower than the computed value. It is possible that the problem expects rounding or approximations, leading to this discrepancy.
