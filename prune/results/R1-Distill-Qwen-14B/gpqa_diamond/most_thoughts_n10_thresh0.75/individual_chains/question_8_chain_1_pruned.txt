Okay, I'm going to try to work through this genetics problem. Let's see... The question is about gene interactions contributing to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. 

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, and G3. We have knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants. The results of their resistance to the pathogen are given. I need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on these results.

First, I remember that when dealing with gene interactions, epistasis can be a key concept. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if knocking out both G1 and G3 gives worse resistance than either alone, that might indicate some epistatic relationship.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, it's less than wild type (100%) but not completely susceptible. Maybe this gene contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big one. So, in the absence of G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. This suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor upstream of others.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, G3's product is contributing, but not as much as G2. Maybe it's downstream or part of a different pathway.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10%. Both knockouts are worse than either single. Hmm.
  - g2g3: 0%. Same as g2 alone. So, in this case, adding another mutation doesn't change the phenotype. Could mean that G3 is epistatic to G2 or vice versa, but given that g2 alone is 0%, maybe G2 is upstream of G3.
  - g1g2: 0%. So, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. So, that's the same as g2 alone.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, it's already 0% resistance. So, when you have g1g2, it's also 0%. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1, because the absence of G2 masks the effect of G1's knockout. Because without G2, you can't get any resistance even if G1 is present.

Wait, let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean that both G1 and G3 are not expressed (if they are downstream targets). So, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not working, leading to no resistance. But what about the g1 mutant? It's at 75%, which is higher than g2 (0%) and g3 (50%).

So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so the plant can't resist. But in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed, but it's only providing 75% of the resistance. Wait, no, because g3 is 50% and g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible relationships. Since G2 knockout leads to 0% resistance, G2 must be a key gene. Since in the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3), all show 0%, which is same as g2 alone. So, in those cases, the presence of G2 is what's allowing any resistance. So, G2 is necessary for the resistance pathway.

Now, in the single mutants: g1
