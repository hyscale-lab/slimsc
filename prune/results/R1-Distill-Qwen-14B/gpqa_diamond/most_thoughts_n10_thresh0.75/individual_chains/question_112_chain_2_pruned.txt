Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem talks about an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

The first part asks for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds like an anti-diagonal matrix. Wait, no. For a 2x2 matrix, if i != j, so A12 and A21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero. So the matrix would look like:
[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0    ]

Wait, but that isn't a diagonal matrix. Oh wait, maybe I should think of it as the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So if each element is hbar/2, then the matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X. So the operator is (hbar/2) ﾏダx.

Now, the next part is to find the probability of measuring the eigenstates of this operator. But wait, the eigenstates of ﾏダx are different from the |up> and |down> states, which are eigenstates of ﾏダz.

Wait, the eigenstates of ﾏダx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So I think the operator in question has eigenstates that are these combinations.

So the state |alpha> is given as a linear combination of |up> and |down>. So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, I can diagonalize the operator A and find the projections.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvectors of A and then compute the inner product between |alpha> and each eigenvector, then square the modulus for the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A's eigenstates
