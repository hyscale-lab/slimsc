Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem says we have a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and turned on again along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field is switched. So I need to find the frequency at which this average oscillates.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So when the magnetic field is in the Z direction, the particle's spin will align with it because the magnetic moment tends to align with the field. The energy levels for spin 1/2 in a magnetic field are given by the Zeeman effect, right? So the energies are proportional to the magnetic quantum number m multiplied by gamma and B. But when the field is suddenly turned off, the spin state might not change instantaneously because the wavefunction can't change immediately. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So the particle's spin is now in a state that's a combination of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, let me think about the spin states. Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, probably the spin-up state, since the magnetic field is along Z. So the initial state is |↑⟩_z. Then, the magnetic field is switched to Y, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian are the eigenstates of Sy.

But since the state is |↑⟩_z, which is not an eigenstate of Sy, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian. This will cause the expectation values, like the average z-component of the magnetic moment, to oscillate over time.

I remember that when a quantum system is in a state that's a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation values oscillate with frequencies related to the energy differences. So the oscillation frequency would be determined by the energy difference between the states involved.

The energy levels for the spin in a magnetic field are E = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma times Sz, the energy is E = -gamma B Sz. But when the field is along Y, the energy becomes E = -gamma B Sy. So the energies are proportional to Sy.

Wait, for spin 1/2, the possible values of Sy are ± ħ/2? No, wait—no, the eigenvalues of Sy are ħ/2 and -ħ/2 multiplied by something. Let me think: the spin matrices. Oh right, the eigenvalues for Sx, Sy, and Sz are ± ħ/2. So for the state |↑⟩_z, which is an eigenstate of Sz, in terms of Sy eigenstates, how would it look?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the time evolution under the new Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy: H = - gamma B Sy. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is H = - mu · B. So when the field is along Y, H = -gamma B Sy. So H = -gamma B ( (ħ/2) sigma_y ), because Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So H = - (gamma B ħ / 2) sigma_y.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the signs. Maybe I should just focus on the form of the Hamiltonian. The important thing is that the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy, which means it's proportional to sigma_y, the Pauli matrix.

The time evolution of a state under a Hamiltonian is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The state will evolve as |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |ψ(0)⟩.

So initially, the state is |↑⟩_z. Let me write that in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. Hmm, the eigenstates of Sy are |+⟩_y and |-⟩_y, which are superpositions of |↑⟩_z and |↓⟩_z. I think the |+⟩_y is (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2, and |−⟩_y is (|↑⟩ − i |↓⟩)/√2. So the initial state |↑⟩ can be written as a linear combination of |+⟩_y and |−⟩_y.

Let me compute that. Let me denote |+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2 and |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ − i |↓⟩)/√2. So solving for |↑⟩ in terms of these states:

|↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

Because:

|+y⟩ = (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2
|−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ − i |↓⟩)/√2
Adding them: |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ = (2 |↑⟩)/(√2)) → |↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

So the initial state is |↑⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/√2.

The energy eigenstates of H are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, with energies E_+ and E_-.

What are their energies? The Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B Sy. Since Sy for |+y⟩ is (ħ/2) * (+1), so E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2)(+1) = - (gamma B ħ)/2.

Similarly, for |−y⟩, Sy is -ħ/2, so E_- = -gamma B (-ħ/2) = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So the two energies are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

The time evolution of each eigenstate is given by a phase factor. So |+y⟩ → exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y⟩ = exp( i (gamma B t/2 )) |+y⟩.

Similarly, |−y⟩ → exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y⟩ = exp( -i (gamma B t/2 )) |−y⟩.

So the time-evolved state |ψ(t)⟩ is:

(1/√2) [ exp(i gamma B t /2 ) |+y⟩ + exp( -i gamma B t /2 ) |−y⟩ ]

I can write this as:

(1/√2) [ exp(i theta) |+y⟩ + exp( -i theta ) |−y⟩ ], where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Now, I need to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ is gamma ⟨S_z⟩. So I can compute ⟨S_z⟩ and then multiply by gamma.

So let's compute ⟨S_z⟩ at time t.

The state is |ψ(t)⟩ = (|+y⟩ e^{i theta} + |−y⟩ e^{-i theta}) / sqrt(2).

So when I compute ⟨S_z⟩, it's:

⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩

Let me compute this. Let's write S_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute in the original |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis.

Alternatively, maybe I can find S_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩. Since |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are eigenstates of Sy, which is different from Sz.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express S_z in terms of the |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ basis.

Let me recall that Sx, Sy, Sz are components of spin. They satisfy the commutation relations [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_{ijk} S_k.

But perhaps I can express S_z in terms of the eigenstates of Sy. Let me write S_z in the basis of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

The eigenstates |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are related to |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ by rotation around the x-axis by 90 degrees. Wait, perhaps it's easier to write down the matrix elements.

In the basis of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, the matrix for S_z can be written.

Since |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and S_z acts as (ħ/2) on |↑⟩ and (-ħ/2) on |↓⟩.

So let's compute S_z |+y⟩:

S_z |+y⟩ = S_z (|↑⟩ + i |↓⟩)/√2
= (S_z |↑⟩ + i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2
= ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ + i (-ħ/2)|↓⟩ ) /√2
= (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ] /√2
= (ħ/2) [ (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) /√2 ]

But wait, (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩ ) /√2 is |−y⟩. Because |−y⟩ = (|↑⟩ -i |↓⟩)/√2.

So S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |−y⟩.

Similarly, S_z |−y⟩ = S_z (|↑⟩ - i |↓⟩)/√2.

= (S_z |↑⟩ -i S_z |↓⟩ ) /√2
= ( (ħ/2)|↑⟩ - i (-ħ/2)|↓⟩ ) /√2
= (ħ/2) [ |↑⟩ + i |↓⟩ ] /√2
= (ħ/2) |+y⟩.

So in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, S_z has the matrix:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because S_z |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |−y⟩, and S_z |−y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩.

So the matrix is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So now, I can compute the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ as the expectation of this operator in the state |ψ(t)⟩.

The state |ψ(t)⟩ in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis is:

(1/√2) [ e^{i theta} |+y⟩ + e^{-i theta} |−y⟩ ]

So the components are a = [ e^{i theta} / √2, e^{-i theta} / √2 ]

The expectation value is a† [ ( [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ) ] a.

Let me compute this.

Let me write the vector as (a1, a2) = (e^{i theta}/√2, e^{-i theta}/√2 )

Then, the expectation value is (a1*, a2*) * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ] * (a1, a2).

Compute each component:

First, (a1*, a2*) multiplied by the matrix:

= [ a1* * 0 + a2* * (ħ/2), a1* * (ħ/2) + a2* * 0 ]

= [ (a2* ħ/2 ), (a1* ħ/2) )

Then multiply by (a1, a2):

= (a2* ħ/2 ) * a1 + (a1* ħ/2 ) * a2

= (ħ/2) ( a2* a1 + a1* a2 )

But a2* a1 is e^{-i theta} / √2 * e^{i theta} / √2 = (e^{0}) ) / 2 = 1/2.

Similarly, a1* a2 = e^{-i theta} / √2 * e^{-i theta} / √2 = e^{-2i theta} / 2.

Wait, no. Wait, a1 = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), so a1* = e^{-i theta}/ sqrt(2).

a2 = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2), a2* = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2).

So a2* a1 = (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) )= e^{i 2 theta} / 2.

a1* a2 = (e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2)) * (e^{-i theta}/ sqrt(2)) )= e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

Wait no, wait: a2* a1 is (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) )= e^{i 2 theta} (1/2)

Wait, no, a2* a1 is (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) )

Because a2* is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), and a1 is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2).

So a2* a1 = [e^{i theta} * e^{i theta} ] / 2 = e^{i 2 theta} / 2.

Similarly, a1* a2 = [e^{-i theta} * e^{-i theta} ] / 2 = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) [ e^{i 2 theta}/2 + e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 ].

But wait, the sum e^{i x} + e^{-i x} = 2 cos x. So this becomes (ħ/2) [ (cos(2 theta) ) * 2 ] / 2.

Wait, let's compute:

[ e^{i 2 theta} + e^{-i 2 theta} ] / 2 = cos(2 theta).

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * [ cos(2 theta) * (1/1) ??? Wait no, wait the entire expression in the brackets is:

[ a2^* a1 + a1^* a2 ] = [ e^{i 2 theta} / 2 + e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 ] = ( e^{i 2 theta} + e^{-i 2 theta} ) / 2 = cos(2 theta).

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * cos(2 theta).

So ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

But theta is gamma B t / 2.

Wait, theta was defined as theta = gamma B t / 2.

So 2 theta is gamma B t.

So ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But the magnetic moment's z-component is mu_z = gamma S_z.

So ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨S_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

So the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t ), with frequency gamma B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The expectation value oscillates as cos(omega t), where omega is gamma B. So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which I think refers to the angular frequency. Or maybe in the problem, frequency refers to the angular frequency. Hmm, the options are in terms of gamma B, so option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made an error in the calculation of the expectation value. Let me double-check the steps.

I think I might have messed up the calculation when I computed the matrix elements. Let me go through that part again.

Wait, when I computed S_z |+y⟩, I found it equals (ħ/2) |−y⟩.

Therefore, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis is:

[ 0 (ħ/2) ]
[ (ħ/2) 0 ]

So when I have the state |psi(t)⟩ as ( |+y> e^{i theta} + |−y> e^{-i theta} ) / sqrt(2), the components are a1 = e^{i theta}/sqrt(2), a2 = e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2).

Then, S_z is represented by the matrix M = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So the expectation value ⟨S_z⟩ is a1 a1^* * M_{11} + a1 a2^* * M_{12} + a2 a1^* * M_{21} + a2 a2^* * M_{22}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct way is to compute the vector (a1*, a2*) multiplied by M multiplied by (a1, a2)^T.

So let me compute this properly.

The state vector is (a1, a2) = ( e^{i theta}/sqrt(2), e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2) )

M is:

[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

So M * (a1, a2)^T is:

[ 0*a1 + (ħ/2)*a2,
  (ħ/2)*a1 + 0*a2 ]

= [ (ħ/2) a2, (ħ/2) a1 ]

Then, the expectation value is (a1*, a2*) multiplied by this vector:

a1* * (ħ/2 a2) + a2* * (ħ/2 a1 )

= (ħ/2) [ a1* a2 + a2* a1 ]

Which is (ħ/2) ( a1* a2 + a2* a1 )

a1* a2 is (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) ( e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ) ) = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2

a2* a1 is (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) = e^{i 2 theta} / 2

So sum is (e^{i 2 theta} + e^{-i 2 theta} ) / 2 = cos(2 theta)

So ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) * cos(2 theta )

And theta is gamma B t / 2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.

Thus, ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

So the expectation value of mu_z is gamma times this, which is (gamma ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine function, which is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B, so the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think about the time dependence.

Wait, the oscillation frequency in the average is omega, which is gamma B. So when the oscillation is cos(omega t), omega is the angular frequency, and the actual frequency in Hz would be omega/(2 pi), but the question just asks for the oscillation frequency, so it's omega, which is gamma B.

So yeah, the answer should be option B.


To determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Initial State**: The particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The initial state is $| \uparrow \rangle_z$, an eigenstate of $S_z$.

2. **Field Switch**: The magnetic field is suddenly turned off and reactivated along the $+Y$ direction. The new Hamiltonian is proportional to $S_y$, given by $H = -\gamma B S_y$. In the $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ basis (eigenstates of $S_y$), the initial state $| \uparrow \rangle_z$ can be expressed as:
   \[
   | \uparrow \rangle_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where $|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle_z + i | \downarrow \rangle_z \right)$ and $|-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle_z - i | \downarrow \rangle_z \right)$.

3. **Time Evolution**: Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\theta} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\theta} |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, leading to the energy eigenstates $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ with energies $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar / 2$, respectively.

4. **Expectation Value of $\langle S_z \rangle$**: The z-component of the spin operator $S_z$ has the matrix representation in the $|+y\rangle, |-y\rangle$ basis:
   \[
   S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & 1 \\
   1 & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]
   The expectation value $\langle S_z \rangle$ in the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(2\theta),
   \]
   where $\cos(2\theta) = \cos(\gamma B t)$ since $\theta = \gamma B t / 2$.

5. **Magnetic Moment**: The z-component of the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. Thus, the expectation value of $\mu_z$ oscillates as:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation frequency is determined by the angular frequency of the cosine term, which is $\omega = \gamma B$.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
