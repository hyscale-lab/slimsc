Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about a wave function for particles in a tube along the x-axis. Each particle has the same wave function given, and when they measured the position, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. Oh right, so when we measure the position, the probability of finding the particle outside this interval should be zero. 

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, the wave function has an imaginary component. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex. But wait, for a valid wave function, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Also, the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1. So the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's write that as ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A(x) is a real function, and B(x) is imaginary. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute the absolute square. The absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [A(x)]² + [B(x)]². So in this case, A(x) is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B(x) is -0.5.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a² / (1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because B is a constant, right? So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

Wait, but the wave function must be normalized. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because the measurement only finds the particle between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that region; actually, the wave function is defined as existing only between x=1 and x=3. Or wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but the measurement shows that the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside that interval. But the problem says that the wave function in the part of space where it can exist is given by that expression. So outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function is zero, but within that interval, it's given by that formula.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's saying that each particle can exist in a part of space where the wave function is that expression. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization integral is from x=1 to x=3.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1. Let's compute that.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, no, wait. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we take the absolute value squared, we have (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Let me set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split this into two integrals:

a² ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each part.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. Let u = 1+x, du=dx. So the integral becomes ∫ du/u from u=2 to u=4. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|. So from 2 to 4, ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to3 is (3-1) = 2.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute a:

a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let's calculate this numerically.

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
   \]

Substituting these results back, we get:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

The closest option to \( 0.849 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
