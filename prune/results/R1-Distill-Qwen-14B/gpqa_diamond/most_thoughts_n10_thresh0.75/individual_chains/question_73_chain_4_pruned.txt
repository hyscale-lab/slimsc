Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, right, so I guess I need to calculate two things: the relative velocity and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two velocities because you can't go faster than the speed of light. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula in special relativity. So the relative velocity u' of one object from the other's frame would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, which one is which? Let me clarify. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, what's the speed of the first?

So, applying the formula: u' = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2/c²)). Plugging in v1 = 0.6c and v2=0.5c. 

Calculating numerator: 0.6c -0.5c=0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1-0.3=0.7. So u' = 0.1c /0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel =0.14c.

Now the total energy of the system. The system consists of two astronauts, each with their own relativistic energies. The total energy would be the sum of their energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

First astronaut: mass 2m, v=0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, v=0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D has the same speed but E=5 mc². So the correct energy is 5.96, so the answer must be option C.

Wait a second, but I should double-check the relative velocity. Let me redo the calculation.

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c²)).

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7) c ≈
