Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, there are two reactions given, and I need to find the major products A and B, and then pick the correct option from the choices. The reactions are:

1. 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+ to give product A.
2. (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

I need to figure out what each reaction does and what the products are.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds are those where two rings are connected by a single atom. So, the structure would have a spiro junction with one ring being 3-membered and the other 5-membered? Wait, wait, spiro[3.5]non means the main chain is 9 carbons? Or wait, spiro[m.n]something: m and n are the number of carbons in each ring.

Wait, spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the main chain is 9 carbons? No, wait, the "non" refers to the total number of carbons in the two rings. So, for a spiro compound, the two rings share one carbon. So, a 3-membered ring would have 3 carbons, and a 5-membered ring would have 5, but since they share one carbon, the total is 3+5-1=7? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the spiro indicates the two rings are connected at one carbon, so the formula would be (for m and n rings) m + n carbons in the rings but minus one for the shared carbon.

But maybe I should draw the structure. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro part would have two rings: one 3-membered and the other 5
