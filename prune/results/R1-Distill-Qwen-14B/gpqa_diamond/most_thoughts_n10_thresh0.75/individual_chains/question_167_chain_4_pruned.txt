Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Wait, so N depends on phi and alpha.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug those in.

First, let's calculate N. Let's compute sin(2 phi). phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. So alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065.

So sin(2 phi) * exp(-2 alpha²) would be (-1) * 0.6065 ≈ -0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, but N is a normalization constant, so |psi> should have norm 1. Let me check: the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. The norm squared would be [cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> ] / N². Wait, but <alpha| -alpha> is the inner product of the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>?

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. They are over-complete and have properties like <alpha|beta> = exp(-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta). So for |alpha> and |-alpha>, <alpha| -alpha> would be exp(-|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 + (-alpha)* alpha) )? Wait, let's compute it.

<alpha|beta> = exp( -|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha^* beta )

So for beta = -alpha, |beta| = |alpha|, so:

exp( -( |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 ) / 2 + alpha^* (-alpha) )

= exp( - alpha^2 - alpha^* alpha / 2 + (- |alpha|^2) )

Wait, no, wait: alpha is a complex number, but in our case, alpha is a real number. Because in the state |alpha>, alpha is a real amplitude, right? Because the coherent states are usually written as |alpha> where alpha is real in this context.

Wait, or is alpha a complex number? Hmm, in the problem statement, alpha is the amplitude. Since the state is |alpha> and |-alpha>, it's probably that alpha is real here. So let's proceed with that.

So, <alpha| -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) )

Which is exp( - 2 alpha^2 / 2 + (- alpha^2) )

Simplify: exp( - alpha^2 - alpha^2 ) = exp( - 2 alpha^2 )

So <alpha| -alpha> = exp( - 2 alpha^2 )

So the norm squared of |psi>:

[ cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> ] / N^2

But since cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1, and <alpha| -alpha> is exp(-2 alpha^2), so the numerator becomes 1
