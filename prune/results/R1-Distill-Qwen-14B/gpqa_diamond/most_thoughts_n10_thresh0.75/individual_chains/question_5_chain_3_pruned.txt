Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They give the components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the components. But wait, the operator here is P, which for a spin-1/2 particle would be the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh right! Because for spin systems, the operators are proportional to Pauli matrices. So Px, Py, Pz are each (ħ/2) times their respective Pauli matrices.

So the operator P is given by the vector product P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Since n lies in the x-z plane, the direction is such that it can be represented by angles theta and phi, but since it's in x-z, phi would be zero or maybe some other angle. Wait, direction in x-z plane means that the vector n can be expressed in spherical coordinates where the angle phi is either 0 or pi, depending on direction. But perhaps more importantly, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so we can express n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), since x-z implies it's in the x and z directions, so the y component of n is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the x-z plane means that the vector n has non-zero x and z components, and y component is zero. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ), depending on convention. Hmm, I think I'll need to clarify that.

Wait, the operator we're looking at is P = n · σ multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation would be (n · P) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. The operator is
