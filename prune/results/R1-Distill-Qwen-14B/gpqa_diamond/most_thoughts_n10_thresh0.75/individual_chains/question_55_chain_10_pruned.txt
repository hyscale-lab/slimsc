Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound from its 1H NMR data, and the options are between cis and trans versions of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

First, I remember that NMR can give a lot of structural information, especially about the environments of hydrogen atoms. The key here is to look at the splitting patterns and chemical shifts to figure out the structure.

The given NMR data is as follows:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quadruplets
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet

I need to assign these signals to different parts of the molecule. Let's start by thinking about the possible structures.

The options are all acetates, so they have an acetate group (OAc), which is usually a good group to look for. The acetate group typically has two sets of protons in the ester. Wait, no, the acetate in an ester like R-O-CO-O-R' would have an OCH2 group? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3 in ethyl acetate, for example. Wait, but the structures here are propenyl and butenyl acetates. So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COOAc, but I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but with a double bond. For example, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, wait, no, the structure would be CH2CH2COO(CH2) something. Or maybe I should think of it as the ester where the R group is either propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, acetates have the structure R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl or alkenyl group from the acid, and R' is the acetyl group. So for propen
