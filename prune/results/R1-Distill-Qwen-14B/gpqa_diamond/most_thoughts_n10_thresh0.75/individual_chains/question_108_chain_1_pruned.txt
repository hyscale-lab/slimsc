Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. It's small m, so the orbital magnetic quantum number is small. B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is the Balmer wavelength corresponding to the transition from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon in the visible range (like the H-alpha line). But wait, let me think about the energy levels.

The transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = - (μ_e * e^4) / (8ε_0²h²) * (1/n²). The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV for the ground state (n=1). The energy difference between two levels is ΔE = E_final - E_initial. Wait, no, for emission, the electron drops from a higher state to a lower one, so ΔE is the absolute value of the difference. So for the Balmer series, when an electron drops from n=2 to n=1, the energy difference would be E_2 - E_1. Wait, no, E_1 is lower (more negative), so E_2 - E_1 is positive, but the energy of the photon emitted is the difference.

So E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E_2 is -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. For n=1, it's -13.6 eV. The difference ΔE is E_2 - E_1 = (-3.4) - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV. Wait, that's a big number. But wait, no, wait. The photon's energy is the absolute value of the transition. So the energy of the photon emitted when going from n=2 to n=1 is 10.2 eV? Wait, that seems high. I thought visible light is lower energy, like around 1.5 to 3 eV. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the transition. Let me recheck. Oh wait, no, the Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, which is about 1.89 eV (since E_3 is -13.6/9 ≈-1.51 eV, E_2 is -3.4 eV. So the difference is 1.89 eV, which is about 640 nm (red light). Oh wait, the wavelength given here is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm—this is the Balmer-beta line (n=4 to n=2), which has energy around 2.16 eV? Wait, perhaps I should calculate
