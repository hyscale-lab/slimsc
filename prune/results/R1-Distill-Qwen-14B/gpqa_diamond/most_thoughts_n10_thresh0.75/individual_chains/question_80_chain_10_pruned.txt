Okay, so I've got this problem where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives an output number. I need to figure out what the output is for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, let's think about how this algorithm might work.

First, I should look for a pattern or a rule that connects the input DNA sequences to the output numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the nucleotides A, T, C, G. Each of these could be assigned a numerical value, perhaps. Let me list them out:

A, T, C, G. I remember that in DNA, A is paired with T, and C with G. So maybe the algorithm is adding the values of the nucleotides in some way.

Looking at the first example: AGG. So the nucleotides are A, G, G. Let me see what each of these could represent numerically. A is 1 maybe? Or perhaps another number. Wait, let me think differently. Maybe each nucleotide has a specific value, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Let me test that with the examples.

For AGG: A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But the output is 115. That doesn't match. So maybe it's not just adding them. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps it's the sum of their positions in the alphabet. A is the 1st letter, T is 20th, C is 3rd, G is 7th. Wait, let me double-check that. A is 1, T is 20? Wait, no. Wait, A is 1, C is 3, G is 7, T is 20? Because A is first letter, C is third, G is seventh, T is twentieth (since T is the 20th letter in the English alphabet). So if I take each nucleotide's position and add them, what's the sum for AGG?

AGG: A=1, G=7, G=7. Sum is 1 +7 +7 =15. But output is 115. Hmm, not matching. Maybe it's multiplying? 1 *7 *7=49. No, that's not 115 either. So perhaps the value is more than just a single digit per nucleotide.

Wait another approach: maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a two-digit number. Like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40? Let's see.

AGG: A=10, G=40, G=40. Sum would be 10 +40 +40=90. Output is 115. Doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's base 10 or another base. Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a different value, perhaps based on their actual base pair structure or something else. Let me think about the outputs given.

AGG is 115. TGCTGA is 176. Let me think about the second example.

TGCTGA: T, G, C, T, G, A. If I assign each a value, perhaps in a different way. Let me think about the sum again. Suppose each T is 5, G is 6, C is 7, A is 8. Let me test that.

Wait, maybe it's based on the order. Like A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4? Wait, that's a possibility. Let's try AGG: A=1, G=3, G=3. Sum is 7. But output is 115. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's not addition. Maybe it's a two-digit or multi-digit code where each nucleotide contributes a digit. Like, for AGG, A is 1, G is 7, G is 7. So 1 followed by two 7's: 177? But the output is 115. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Another approach: perhaps the output is the sum of the ASCII values of each nucleotide. Let me think. The ASCII value for 'A' is 65, 'T' is 84, 'C' is 67, 'G' is 71. So AGG: A is 65, G is 71, G is 71. Sum is 65 +71 +71=207. But output is 115, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the sum is for the entire sequence, but perhaps it's the sum of the product of adjacent nucleotides? Or the sum of each product of pairs. For AGG, which is A, G, G. So (A*G) + (G*G). Let's compute. A=1, G=4: 1*4=4, G*G=16. Sum 4+16=20. Not 115. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe it's the product of all the nucleotides. For AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So product is 1*4*4=16. Not 115.

Hmm, perhaps it's the sum of the squares of each. For AGG: 1² +4² +4² =1 +16 +16=33. Not 115.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a two-digit number based on its position in the sequence. For example, first nucleotide is 1, second is 2, etc., but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the outputs: 115 and 176. Let me see if these numbers have any connection to the sequences.

115: the digits are 1,1,5. TGCTGA is 6 letters, output is 176 (3 digits). Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the algorithm is converting each nucleotide into a number, then summing them, but the numbers are larger. Maybe each nucleotide represents a two-digit number, like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Let's try.

AGG: 10 +40 +40=90. But output is 115. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the numbers are based on their position in the DNA structure, like A is 1, T is 5, C is
