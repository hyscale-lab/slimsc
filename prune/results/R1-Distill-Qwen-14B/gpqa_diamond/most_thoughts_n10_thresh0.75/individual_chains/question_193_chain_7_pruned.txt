Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given relation between the number of stars and parallax. Alright, let's break this down.

So the question says: In a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r? The options are from A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Wait, I need to relate parallax to distance first because the given relation is in terms of parallax. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, meaning d = 1/plx. That's the key relation. So higher parallax means closer distance because closer stars have larger parallaxes. 

Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let me express this in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in, N becomes proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, but the question is asking how N changes with distance, but wait, the options are presented in terms of r, perhaps as a differential or per unit distance. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the number of stars in a shell or something between r and r + dr.

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So I think it's referring to how the number of stars varies with each increment in distance. So let's model this. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of that shell times the volume density of stars. 

Wait, but wait, the problem says the number varies as 1/(plx^5), but I'm not sure if that's per unit volume or per unit area. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But that's for a specific distance d. But the question seems to be about how many stars are in a region as you move a unit distance away, like how the density changes with distance.

Wait, perhaps instead, the number of stars per unit distance is what's being asked. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with d (dN/dd) would be 5d^4. But that's the rate of change of the total number with respect to d. But the question is about per unit range of distance r
