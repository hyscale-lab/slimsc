Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So the space is 2D, and this is a line element in some sort of geometry.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in 2D, I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's part of a higher-dimensional object? Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing terms here.

Wait, in 2D, the concept of a pseudosphere is a bit different. Or maybe it's referring to a surface embedded in 3D space, but the metric given is 2D. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the metric itself represents a space that can be considered a pseudosphere.

Alternatively, the term "pseudosphere" might be a red herring, and the question is more about calculating the area of a surface defined by this metric, perhaps the 2-sphere in this space. But wait, the metric's denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks a bit like the metric for a hyperboloid or something with negative curvature.

Wait, let's think about the metric. The metric is conformally flat because it's written as a multiple of
