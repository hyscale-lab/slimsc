Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the parallax is smaller, the distance is larger.

Wait, the number of stars depends on parallax. So if parallax decreases, distance increases. But how does that affect the number of stars?

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance. So maybe they're asking about the density of stars as a function of distance.

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5, which is the same as N ∝ r^5, where r is the distance. But wait, that can't be right because the number of stars should depend on the volume, which is r cubed. Or am I getting confused here?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume density of stars. Oh, right, because the number of stars is a function of density times volume. So if the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which translates to d^5, that's the number per unit volume? Or maybe the number in a certain volume.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. Let's think in terms of a thin spherical shell at distance r, with thickness dr. The volume of the shell is approximately 4πr² dr. If the number density (stars per unit volume) is n, then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πr² dr.

But according to the problem, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, this is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, I thought N would be the count in a certain volume. Or is N the count per unit volume?

Wait, no. Wait the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5) where k is a proportionality constant.

But since plx = 1/d, N = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But d is the distance. So N ∝ r^5, where r is the distance. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But wait, the question is how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. So are they asking about the density? Or the number in a given shell?

Wait, the way the problem is phrased, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N(r) = k * r^5. Then, the number of stars in a small range dr around r would be dN = (dN/dr) dr. So dN/dr is 5k r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4, meaning the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but that's for the number within a thin shell. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the number per unit volume, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach it differently.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d: plx = 1/d. So 1/plx = d. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, then N is proportional to d^5.

But in terms of distance, the number of stars in a given volume would be N = n * V, where n is the number density and V is the volume. So if N ∝ d^5, and the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3, then perhaps n is varying. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars increases as d^5, which is r^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So if N(r) = kr^5, then the derivative dN/dr = 5kr^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (like the density) increases with r^4.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5, which would be N(r), and option C is r^4, which is the rate of change. So the question is, what's the change per unit range. That would be the derivative, so proportional to r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The number of stars in a region varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N ∝ r^5. So if you have a thin shell, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to r^5 * 4π r² dr? No, wait. Because a thin shell at radius r has a volume of 4π r² dr, so the number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density (n).

But if the number density (n) is such that N(r) = kr^5, then n(r) = N(r)/( (4/3) π r^3 ), assuming that r is the radius up to which we're counting stars. Wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a given spherical shell (between r and r+dr) is dN = (4π r² dr) * n(r), where n(r) is the number density at radius r.

But according to the problem, the total number of stars within a distance r is N(r) = k (r^5). Because the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, so N(r) = k r^5.

So if N(r) = integral from 0 to r of dN = integral n(r) * 4π r² dr. But if N(r) = kr^5, then the derivative dN/dr = 5 kr^4. But that would be the number of stars in the shell at r, dN = 5 kr^4 dr.

Wait, but that suggests that the number of stars in the shell is proportional to r^4, because dN/dr = 5 kr^4. But that's the number added per unit distance. So the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance is r^4.

So the correct answer would be that the number of stars per unit distance (the change) is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it in terms of the number density.

If N(r) = kr^5, then the number of stars inside a sphere of radius r is kr^5. The volume is (4/3) π r^3. So the number density n(r) is N(r)/V = kr^5 / ( (4/3) π r^3 ) ) = (3k/(4 π)) r^2. So n(r) is proportional to r^2.

Then, the number of stars in a thin shell dr would be n(r) * 4π r² dr = [ (3k/(4 π)) r^2 ] * 4 π r² dr = 3k r^4 dr. So dN = 3k r^4 dr, which is proportional to r^4.

So the number of stars added per unit distance (i.e., the change in number with distance dr) is proportional to r^4, which would be option C.

But wait, the question is phrased as, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit distance, the number of stars added is dN/dr, which is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer is C, which is r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \)), this relationship can be rewritten as \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars within a distance \( r \) increases as \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \). The volume of this shell is approximately \( 4\pi r^2 dr \), and the number of stars in the shell is proportional to the number density \( n(r) \) multiplied by the shell's volume. 

From \( N(r) \propto r^5 \), the number density \( n(r) \) is given by \( n(r) = \frac{N(r)}{\text{Volume}} \propto \frac{r^5}{r^3} \propto r^2 \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we find \( dN \propto n(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr \propto r^2 \cdot r^2 \cdot dr \propto r^4 dr \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the rate of change of the number of stars with distance) is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
