Okay, so I've got this problem about black hole entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is related to their area. Oh right, the formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I might have mixed up the exact formula. Let me think again—oh yeah, I think that's correct. So the key here is to find the area A from the given angular size.

The problem states that the angular size (theta) of the event horizon is 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is 1e10 parsecs. I need to calculate A, which is the area of the event horizon, and then plug it into the entropy formula.

First, let's convert the angular size to radians because the formula for the radius of the event horizon uses radians. Right, since theta (in radians) is approximately equal to the arc length divided by radius, which for small angles can be approximated as the diameter or so.

Wait, the angular size θ is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance. So diameter d = 2r, where r is the radius of the event horizon. So r = (θ * distance) / 2. But wait, I need to be careful with units here. Oh yeah, θ is in degrees, but I need to convert it to radians.

So converting θ from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let's compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * (π / 180) ≈ (1e-17) * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation, but maybe an order of magnitude is sufficient here.

The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, no, wait. 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs
