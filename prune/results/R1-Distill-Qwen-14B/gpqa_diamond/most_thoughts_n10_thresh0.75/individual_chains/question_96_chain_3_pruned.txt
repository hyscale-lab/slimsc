Okay, so I have this problem about a supermassive black hole and finding the order of magnitude of its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. 

The question gives me the distance to the galaxy as 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size of the event horizon is 10^-17 degrees. I need to find the entropy of the black hole. 

Wait, entropy of a black hole... right, I remember there's something called the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. Oh right, it's S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think again. Yes, it's S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G ħ), or wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up now, but I think it's S = (k_B A c^3)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area. So I'll go with that.

So the first step is to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4 π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But I don't have r; instead, I have the angular size θ. So I can find the diameter of the event horizon as seen from the galaxy's distance. 

Angular size θ is given in degrees, but I think I need to work in radians for the small angle approximation. The formula for linear size is d * θ ≈ diameter, where θ is in radians. Wait, more accurately, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the arc length (which for small angles is the same as the chord length) divided by the radius, which here would be the distance. So θ ≈ diameter / (2d), wait no, wait. Let me get this right. The angular size θ is the angle subtended at the observer. So the actual size (diameter) L is approximately θ (in radians) multiplied by the distance d. But wait, more precisely, L = 2 r, and θ = L/(2d) → r = θ d. Wait, no, no: The Schwarzschild radius is r, so the diameter is 2r. The angular size is approximately (2r) / d, assuming d is much larger than r, which it is for a supermassive black hole. So θ (in radians) ≈ 2r / d. So solving for r: r ≈ (d θ)/2. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for the angular size when an object of size L is at distance D is θ (in radians) ≈ L / D, when L << D. So in this case, the size of the event horizon is L = 2r (since radius is r, diameter is 2r). So θ ≈ (2r) / d. Therefore, r ≈ (d θ) / 2. 

So once I have r, I can compute the area A = 4 π r². Then plug into the entropy formula. 

Let me write down the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Calculate r = (d * θ) / 2.
3. Compute A = 4 π r².
4. Plug A into S = (k_B A c^3)/(4 ħ G) to get entropy.

Wait, but I think I should make sure about the Schwarzschild radius formula. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by 2 G M / c². So r = R_s = 2 G M / c². But in this case, I'm deriving r from the angular size, so maybe I don't need that yet.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, let's compute
