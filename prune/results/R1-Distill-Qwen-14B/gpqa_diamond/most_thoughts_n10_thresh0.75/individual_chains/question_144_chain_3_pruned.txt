Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. 

Wait, right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau), but wait, isn't it also considering the velocity of the particle? Oh yeah, the mean decay length L is given by L = gamma * v * c * tau. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? So gamma equals the total energy E divided by the rest mass energy m. Or wait, is it E divided by m? Let me think. Oh, yeah, gamma is E/(m c²), but since we’re working in units where c=1, maybe it's just E/m.

Wait, the production energy is given as E_X=8 GeV, and m_X=1.2 GeV. So gamma would be 8/1.2, which is 6.666... approximately 6.6667. Okay, got that.

But then I'm a bit fuzzy on the actual formula for the mean decay distance. Oh wait, I think the mean proper lifetime (tau) is related to the width Gamma via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime and energy are inversely related. The formula should be tau = hbar / Gamma. But wait, what are the units here? Hmm.

Let me recap. The decay width Gamma is given as 320 MeV. But
