Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out by recalling some concepts.

Wait, I remember that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which means it can have charges flow in or out. So if a charge q is placed near it, the sphere might get induced charges or even some redistribution.

Let me think about the method. Potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to assemble the charges. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, maybe the charge distribution adjusts in a certain way. Oh, right! For a conducting sphere, any external charge will induce an opposite charge on the near side and the same charge on the far side. But wait, no, wait. No, I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

The conducting sphere is neutral to start with because it's grounded. When the charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is a conductor, the charges will redistribute. The induced charges on the sphere's surface will be such that the inner surface has an induced charge equal and opposite to q, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to whatever is needed to keep the sphere neutral. Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, it can exchange charges with the Earth. So, if I bring a positive charge q near the sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have a negative charge -q, and the outer surface will have a charge such that the total remains neutral (since it's grounded). Wait, noâ€”wait, the sphere's initial charge is zero. So when a charge q is placed nearby, the sphere's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the sphere is zero, so if the inner surface is -q, the outer must be +q. 

Wait, but wait, the sphere is conducting and initially neutral. The presence of the external charge q induces a charge distribution. The induced charges on the inner surface would be -q, and the induced on the outer surface would be +q, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the outer surface
