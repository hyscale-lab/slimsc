Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relationship involving parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I need to think about the exact relationship.

The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Oh wait, but parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax, plx, is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So if plx is 1/r, then r is 1/plx.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of r and then see how N depends on r. Let me substitute plx with 1/r in the given equation.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, does that mean the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance?

Wait, but let me think again. Because the number of stars you see in a region depends on how much volume you're looking at. Volume is proportional to r^3, because volume is (4/3)πr³. So the number of stars should generally go up with the cube of the distance, assuming stars are uniformly distributed.

But this problem says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx = 1/r, we get N proportional to r^5. That seems different from the usual volume case. But maybe the distribution of stars isn't uniform? Or perhaps this is a specific scenario where the number of stars is being counted in a certain way.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So it's the differential, like dN/dr. Because that would give the number of stars per unit distance. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just about the trend, whether it's proportional to r^5 or something else.

Wait, let me clarify the setup. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Plx is 1/r, so N = k * (r)^5. So N proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as the fifth power. But that seems very high. Typically, number density (stars per volume) decreases with distance if you're considering a certain depth, but maybe this is a different situation.

Wait, perhaps this is about the number of stars within a certain distance, not the density. Wait, no, the question states the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for each unit of plx, you get a certain number of stars. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so as distance increases, plx decreases.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting plx as 1/r: N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

But wait, in reality, the number of stars you can see in a region would increase with the volume, so r^3. But this seems to be a different case here. Maybe it's a specific scenario where the number of stars isn't following the usual distribution. So according to the given proportionality, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's about the differential, like the change in N with respect to r.

Wait, but if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the change per unit distance would be proportional to r^4. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the count within a thin shell of radius r, so the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area times some factor, but that's more about the number per unit volume.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try another approach. Parallax plx = 1/r (in parsecs). So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 = r^5.

So if I plot N against r, it's a r^5 relation. Therefore, N increases with the fifth power as r increases.

But the options are about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So the change in N per unit r would be dN/dr. Let me compute that. dN/dr = 5 r^4. But none of the options seem to directly mention r^4. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Oh, option C is r^4. But wait, the question is phrased as: "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording. It's asking for the change in number with distance, so perhaps it's the derivative, dN/dr. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4.

So the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance (per unit distance) would be proportional to r^4. Hence, the correct answer would be C) ~ r^4.

But wait, looking back at the initial substitution, I may have made a mistake. Let me redo it.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And plx = 1/r.

So N = k * (r)^5, because 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Therefore, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is about the change in number with distance. So it's about the slope, the rate of change. So dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the rate is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with distance. So if the number is increasing as r^5, then for each additional unit of r, the number increases by 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N = k / plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, N = k r^5. So N increases as r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So per unit change in r, like the derivative. So the answer would be the derivative, which is r^4.

Therefore, the answer is C) ~ r^4.


The problem involves determining how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks specifically about how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance," which implies the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4.
\]

Thus, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \).**
