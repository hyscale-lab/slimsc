Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So the question is about an organic reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The product is analyzed using TLC, and there are two new spots observed, which suggests two products formed.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Wait, let me draw that structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. The structure of the butenyl group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2- but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, let's count. But has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? Or wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl maybe. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The structure is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at position 3? Wait, that can't be because but has four carbons, so the positions are 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4. So the butenyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but in reality, it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait but that's but-1
