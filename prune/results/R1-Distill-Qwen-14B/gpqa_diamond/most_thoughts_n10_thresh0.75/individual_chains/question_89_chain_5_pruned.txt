Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and we're supposed to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

First, breaking down the problem. The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. But wait, in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait a second, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide where the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure, right?

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the molecule is quite rigid. Heating with KOH would lead to the elimination of HBr twice, right? Because each Br is on a different carbon. So that would form a double bond. Wait, but wait—two eliminations could lead to forming a diene or maybe a single double bond plus some rearrangement? Hmm, but in this case, the product is a light yellow solid, which is typical for an elimination product, maybe an alkene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. Wait, but if we started with dihalide and used KOH, elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Oh, wait, wait. Maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! Wait, KOH in certain conditions might lead to a different type of elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else.

Wait, I might be mixing up the reactions. Let me think again. Oh, wait a second! If the dihalide is treated with a strong base, like KOH, and especially in a high temperature, maybe it forms an epoxide? No, wait, no. Epoxidation would require an oxidizing agent, right? Like peracids. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, but in a way that forms a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, maybe it's a vicarious elimination, but that's more for aromatic systems, which this isn't. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: when dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can form alkenes via E2 mechanisms. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two E2 eliminations, it would lose two HBr molecules and form a triple bond, right? Because each E2 would remove one H and one Br. Wait, but wait, losing two HBr would require two adjacent Brs. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Are those adjacent? Let's think about the structure of adamantane.

Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is bonded to three others, forming a diamond lattice. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons. Wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are on opposite ends, but I think in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbon atoms. So, the structure might allow for the formation of a triple bond upon double elimination. Because when two adjacent dihalides lose HX, they form an alkene. But losing two adjacent HXs from adjacent positions would form a triple bond? Wait, because each elimination would form a double bond, but two eliminations would require more than just adjacent dihalides.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Let me think again: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the product has a ketone group. How can that happen from elimination? Oh! Wait, perhaps it's not elimination but substitution. When a dihalide reacts with a base, especially in certain conditions, it can undergo substitution. But substitution of two halides... Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a neighboring group elimination. Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is treated with a strong base, and the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so when KOH is present, each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would form a diol. But
