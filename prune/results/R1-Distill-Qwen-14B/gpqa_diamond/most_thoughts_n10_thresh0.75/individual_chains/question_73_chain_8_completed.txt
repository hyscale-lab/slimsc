Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about relativistic speeds and total energy. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, I guess I subtract their speeds. But wait, no, that's not right in relativity. Because when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the values. Here, v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. Hmm, that's about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So the first part of the answer is either C or D.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So I need to compute the energy for each and add them up.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). For the first astronaut, v=0.6c. So gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, the mass of the first astronaut is 2m. So energy1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So energy2 = gamma2 * 3m * c². Let's compute that: 1.1547 *3 ≈ 3.464 mc².

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Square root of 0.75 is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. So 1.1547 * 3m = 3.464 m.

So total energy E = energy1 + energy2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc². Oh, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc². So the correct option should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Energy1: 2m * gamma1 = 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 mc². Correct.

Energy2: 3m * gamma2. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547. So 3 * 1.1547 = approx 3.4641. So 3.4641 mc². Adding 2.5 gives 5.9641, which rounds to 5.96.

So yes, the total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is about 0.14c. So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy is \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
