Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are usually unsaturated, like alkenes or alkynes, because they undergo addition reactions with bromine. So mixture X probably contains two such compounds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction, and forms mixture Y, which is equimolar and two other liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, that suggests that Y's compounds are more saturated. Since X's components are unsaturated, maybe Y's are products of hydrogenation or some other addition.

Wait, the problem says it's a result of disproportionation. Oh right, disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is undergoing disproportionation.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each undergoes a reaction. Wait no, the problem says the treatment with platinum causes a disproportionation, so maybe one of the components in X is causing that. Alternatively, maybe the two components in X are each undergoing some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Let me read further. Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and same for Y. Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Let me calculate what that means.

Mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(molecular mass) = 14.28% which is 0.1428. Let's suppose Z is CnH2m. So the molecular formula must satisfy (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 0.1428. Let me solve for n and m.

Alternatively, maybe it's a simpler formula. Let's think about common solvents. The problem says Z is widely used as a solvent. Common solvents are like hexane, heptane, toluene, etc. But wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, so probably an alkane, maybe.

Wait, Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So Y must have at least one component that is Z. But Y is formed from X via some reaction, probably hydrogenation.

Wait, let me think differently. The problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y forms. So perhaps X has some alkenes or alkynes, which upon hydrogenation give alkanes. But wait, since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, Y's components are saturated, so perhaps Y contains alkanes.

But wait, mixture Y is formed by a disproportionationâ€”so maybe one of the components in X is being disproportionated. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where an alkene is hydrogenated to an alkane.

Wait, but the hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is a hydrocarbon. So X's components, when hydrogenated, give Z. Similarly for Y's components, when hydrogen
