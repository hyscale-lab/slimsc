Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is about how many peaks will be observed in each chromatogram.

Let me start by understanding each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on the third carbon. The structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. When LAH reduces the ketone, it should convert the carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, no, wait. LAH usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the position of the hydroxyl would be on the same carbon as the ketone. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol.

Wait, but the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is:

CH2CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the positions are important. Let me draw it.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, not sure. Let me count the carbons correctly. Hexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, hexan-3-one has the carbonyl group on
