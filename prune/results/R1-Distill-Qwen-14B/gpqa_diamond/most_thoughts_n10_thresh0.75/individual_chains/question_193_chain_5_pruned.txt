Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx', right? Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. I think I messed that up. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star because the parallax is measured in arcseconds and they get smaller as the stars get farther away. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think. Parallax p is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So if p is small, the distance is big. So yeah, as distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

So the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. That means the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. But I need to relate this to distance. Since parallax and distance are inversely related, I can express parallax in terms of distance.

Wait, parallax p is 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So plx is p, which is 1/d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be (d)^5. Because plx is 1/d, so (1/d)^5 is d^-
