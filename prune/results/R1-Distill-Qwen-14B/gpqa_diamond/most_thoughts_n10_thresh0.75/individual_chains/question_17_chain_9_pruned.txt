Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds to metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means it's in the exact molar ratio, right? So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion, so the formula is probably CaY²− or something like that.

The given K for the complex, KCa-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant, which tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the ions are tightly bound.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, the free Ca²+ concentration should be low, right? Because most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

So, the formation reaction would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = 5e10.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But we need to find [Ca²+] in solution.

Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, I think the concentration of free EDTA would be y. But wait, in the complex, each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA. So for each mole of Ca²+ that's free, it's because it's not bound. But in the presence of excess EDTA, the free EDTA would be in solution.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, we can model this as:

The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The total calcium species is the sum of
