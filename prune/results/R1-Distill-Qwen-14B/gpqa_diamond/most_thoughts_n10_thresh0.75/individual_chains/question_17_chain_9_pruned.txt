Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. I remember that K is also known as the stability constant for the complex ion.

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²−, right? Because EDTA is Y^4−, and calcium is Ca²+. So the formula would be CaY²−. So the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. 

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. I think when a complex is in solution, the concentration of the ions depends on how much the complex dissociates. But wait, if the complex is stable, it might not dissociate much. 

The formula for the formation constant, K, is K = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, I can assume that [CaY²−] is 0.02 M initially. But wait, the situation is a bit more complicated because EDTA also has multiple protonations depending on pH. Oh, but the question states that the pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA. So we can treat EDTA as Y^4−, right?

So the initial concentrations: [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So, if the complex dissociates, then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4−] would also be x because each CaY²− gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−. Therefore, the reaction is CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The complex is in solution, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So, assuming that the dissociation is negligible (which might be the case because K is so large), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M
