Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and think about what each part is telling me.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm, I need to figure out what X might be. Let me break it down step by step.

First, gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecular weight would be double the atomic number? Wait, wait. Let me think: the number of protons is the atomic number, and the number of neutrons would be similar or same? For example, if the molecule is H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So H2O has 2 H's (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 +8=10, neutrons: 0+8=8. Not same as protons. So not H2O.

Wait, the molecule of gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the entire molecule must have protons = neutrons. Let's think of possible molecules. Maybe CO2? No, that's 2 O's. Let me think of a molecule with same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, another angle: let's think about possible gases that are produced in reactions. For example, H2 gas is possible. But H2 has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So for H2, total protons are 2, neutrons are 0. Not equal. That doesn't fit.

Another gas: O2. O has 8 protons each. O2 has 2 atoms, so 16 protons. Neutrons in O are 8 normally (like in O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons (because each O has 8 neutrons, 2 atoms so 16). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Oh! So that matches.

So gas W is O2. Because each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, same number.

So W is O2. Then, the reaction of X with Y is producing O2.

Wait, what reactions produce O2 gas? Maybe decomposition of a peroxide, or some redox reaction.

Looking at the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, so B is probably a solid at room temperature. Wait, what compounds have a melting point near 4째C? Hmm, maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's water, but water freezes at 273 K (0째C). Wait, 277 K is around 4째C, so maybe B is something that freezes just a bit above 0째C. Alternatively, perhaps B is some other compound.

Wait, but maybe B is a basic substance. Since when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate that when heated decomposes into CO2 and B. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide that upon heating becomes an oxide.

Wait, another angle: if X is a strong base, perhaps Y is an acid. Or vice versa. But let me think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.
