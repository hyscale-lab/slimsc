Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So the molecule must have a formula where each atom has equal p and n. For example, O2 has each O atom with 8 p and 8 n (since O's atomic number is 8 and the common isotope is 16O). Wait, but O has 8 protons and in 16O, 8 neutrons, so yes. So W could be O2.

But wait, another possibility is H2O. Wait no, because each molecule would have H and O. Let me think: for the molecule as a whole, the total protons should equal total neutrons. Let's see, O2: each O has 8 protons, so 16 total in O2. Neutrons per O is 8, so 16 in total. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits.

So W is O2, perhaps. So when X reacts with Y, it releases O2 gas.

Now, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let me calculate what's 277 K in Celsius. 277 - 273 = 4°C. So B's melting point is around 0°C? Wait, no, 277 K is about 4°C. So what substance has a melting point near 4°C?

Wait, maybe I should think about common substances. For example, water freezes at 0°C (273 K), but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a different phase of something. Alternatively, think about other substances.

Wait, another thought: if upon heating G, B is released. Maybe G is a carbonate or something that decomposes upon heating. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating would produce CO2 and a metal oxide. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the melting point of B is near 277 K. Let me think about the melting points of some substances. Water is 273 K (0°C), so 277 is 4°C. Hmm. What about another substance. Wait, maybe B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, NaOH is solid at room temp. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's liquid around 0°C. Wait, maybe B is something else. Or perhaps I'm thinking about the wrong approach.

Let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So Y must be a solution, perhaps. X is a reagent, maybe a metal, reacting with an acid to
