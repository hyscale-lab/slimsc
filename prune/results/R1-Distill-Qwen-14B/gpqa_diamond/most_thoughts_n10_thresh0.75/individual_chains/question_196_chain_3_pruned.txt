Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The given parameters are mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. Oh right, so it's like a regular harmonic oscillator but in the relativistic context, which probably means we'll have to consider relativistic effects on the equations of motion.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². So equating them, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's the non-relativistic case, which is option C. But the question is about the relativistic scenario, so option C might not be the correct answer here.

But wait, in the relativistic case, things are different because as the speed approaches the speed of light c, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it becomes γmc² - mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (kA²)/2, but wait, no, actually the potential energy of a spring is (1/2)kx², so at maximum amplitude x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, wait—wait, in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy isn't (1/2)kx² because the force is F = -kx, so the potential energy would be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)kx². So the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement.

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which equals the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Hmm, let me write that down: (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc². Let's solve for γ.

So (γ - 1) = (kA²)/(2mc²). So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

But γ is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write that: 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because E_kinetic is (γ-1)mc² = (1/2)kA². So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

So let's denote (kA²)/(
