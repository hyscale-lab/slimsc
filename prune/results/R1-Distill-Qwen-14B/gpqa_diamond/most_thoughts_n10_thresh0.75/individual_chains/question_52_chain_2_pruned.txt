Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. Okay, so I think I remember that in LTE, the number of atoms in different energy states is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric Teff decreases. So the spots are cooler regions, but how does that affect the overall photosphere's temperature? Oh wait, the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. But wait, the star's photosphere is being considered. So perhaps the presence of spots affects the observed temperature.

Wait, no. Wait, the Teff is the effective temperature, which is determined by the total luminosity and radius, but the spots would lower the overall luminosity. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the average Teff drops because the spots are cooler.

But how does that affect the photospheric temperature? Oh, wait, no. The effective temperature is an average, but the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is 5500 K. So the spots are regions with lower temperature, and the rest of the photosphere is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere at 5500 K?

Wait, the problem states that when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the average Teff is lower because the spots are cooler. But how does this affect the photosphere's temperature structure?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Are the spots affecting the average temperature, or is the entire photosphere at a lower temperature? I think the spots are cooler regions on the surface, so the majority of the surface (60%) is at 6000 K, and 40% is at a lower temperature (maybe like 5000 K or something, but the problem doesn't specify the spot temperature). But the
