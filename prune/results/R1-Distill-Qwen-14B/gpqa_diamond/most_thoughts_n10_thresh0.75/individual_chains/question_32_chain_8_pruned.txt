Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity equations, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, so Li is lithium. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6, I think. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion, but wait, ions have charges. The charge would depend on the number of electrons. But wait, in a collider, they're probably using bare nuclei, meaning fully stripped of electrons, so charge would be +e multiplied by the atomic number. Wait, no, the charge would be +3e for Li-6, because it has 3 protons. But wait, the charge might not matter for the energy calculation because the energy formula for relativistic particles typically uses the rest mass energy, which is for the nucleus as a whole.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when moving at 0.96c. 

I remember from special relativity that the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So first, I'll calculate gamma. The speed v is 0.96c, so let's plug that into the gamma equation.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c²) 

Simplify that: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) 

0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but let me do that calculation more accurately. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.921
