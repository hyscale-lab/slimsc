Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation in stellar atmospheres, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both stars are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the Boltzmann equation should apply here.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula I remember is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

Wait, in this question, it says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that refers to the population ratio between the excited state and the ground state or another state. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, and E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So, E2 = E1 + ΔE.

The number of atoms in E2 compared to E1 would be (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But wait, in the problem, it's stated that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, n2/n1 is 2 times higher than n2/n1 in star_2. Or wait, no. Wait, the statement says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe n1 is for the lower state and n2 is the higher state. So in star_1, n2 is twice as much as in star_2? Or wait, no, maybe the ratio of n2/n1 in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy
