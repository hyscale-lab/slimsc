Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to go through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, that sounds like a reaction mechanism I should recall.

First, let me look at the given data. The IR spectrum has peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But also, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh wait, but then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1. That might be from aromatic C=C bonds because aromatic rings typically show peaks around there. The 1450 cm-1 could be another aromatic peak or maybe some alkyl group vibrations.

Now the NMR data. Starting with the 1H NMR: 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. That could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually upfield or downfield? Wait, aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm, but they can vary. But another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they usually show as broad signals due to hydrogen bonding. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid.

But let me think again. The 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which is close. So maybe that's the case. Then, the NMR would have a broad peak around 10.5 ppm for the -OH of the carboxylic acid.

Next, looking at the aromatic protons. There's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring because the two doublets each have two protons and are split into doublets, which is typical for para substitution. So a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The protons next to the substituent would be more deshielded, so the higher ppm (8.0 ppm) would be the protons adjacent to the substituent.

Wait, but if there's a substituent on the benzene ring, let's say group A and group B. Looking at the substituent positions. If it's para, then the protons on either side of each substituent would be in a doublet. So maybe the substituent is at position 1 and 4, or maybe another arrangement.

Wait, no, wait. In a para-substituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, ortho to substituent A, and para to substituent B. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the substituent is in the para position, then the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 perhaps. Wait, no
