Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about Compound X, which has specific IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I think I should analyze the spectral data to determine what Compound X is. Then, I'll figure out what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region might indicate O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the presence of a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests an ester or maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But 1720 is more typical for esters, maybe. Also, there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹, which often correspond to aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and an ester group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This is a broad singlet. Could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid, but wait, the IR didn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹ which is typical for O-H in carboxylic acids. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but that's a sharp singlet. Hmm, but here it's broad, so maybe an O-H from something else, like an alcohol or maybe an enol. Or perhaps it's a phenolic O-H. Wait, but phenolic O-H usually is broader but maybe around 5 ppm, but in more acidic conditions, maybe higher. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, likely para-substituted since it's a doublet. So maybe the aromatic ring has two substituents in para positions.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also a doublet. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, and each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents? Or perhaps one substituent with two H's. Wait, no, each substituent on the benzene ring would cause a certain splitting.

Wait, the aromatic signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) with each as a doublet. So that suggests a para-disubstituted benzene, but perhaps each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Wait, no, if there are two substituents, like in para positions, each would split the neighboring H's into doublets. So perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but in that case, each substituent would have two protons adjacent, each giving a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substitution, but that would give more splitting. Hmm, but in our case, each substituent is as a doublet. So maybe it's a substituent that's in the para position, leading to each pair of protons being a doublet. For example, a substituent in the para position would split the two adjacent protons into a doublet each.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituent is in the para position, but each substituent has two protons, like an -OCH3 group. Hmm, but in that case, maybe the neighboring protons would have different shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, looking further, the NMR data also includes:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Or perhaps a CH next to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, or part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three H's, perhaps a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3)-something.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, perhaps as part of an ethyl chain or a larger alkyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about the aromatic region. The doublets suggest that each substituent is causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets. If the substituents are para to each other, then each substituent would split the adjacent Hs into doublets, but how many Hs would be there? For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, perhaps each substituent is a group that has two Hs, but that's not possible for a single substituent. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions and each substituent is a -CH2- group, but that might not account for the splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at the para positions, and each is a -COOR group. No, that would be a meta substituent. Wait, no, if there's a substituent on the benzene ring at position 1 and position 3, that would be meta. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substit
