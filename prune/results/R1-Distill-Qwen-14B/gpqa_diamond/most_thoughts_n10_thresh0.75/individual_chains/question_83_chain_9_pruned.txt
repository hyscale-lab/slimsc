Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, it forms the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base. The pH will depend on how much of the acid has been neutralized.

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentration after dilution. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 = 1 mmol, then 1 mmol /40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point volume can be found. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol. Wait, no. Wait, wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After dilution with 20 cm³ (0.02 L), the total volume is 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, right.

So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. To reach equivalence point with NaOH, which has a concentration of 0.1 M, the volume needed would be (moles NaOH) = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³? Because 10 * 0.25 is 2.5. So during the titration, when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, that's the 25% point.

Wait, another way: the 25% titration might refer to 25% of the total moles reacted. Let me think. So 25% of the equivalence point is when a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Alternatively, perhaps it's 25% of the volume added, but I think it's 25% of the moles. So I'll proceed with 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, first, let's tackle the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L
