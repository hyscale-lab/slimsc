Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a particular spin state. 

Hmm, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). I think that represents a two-component vector, like a column vector in the spinor notation. So, it's probably written as a vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. So the state vector χ would be [3i; 4], right?

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <S> = ⟨χ| S |χ⟩, where S is the spin operator. In this case, S is S_y, the spin in the y-direction.

Wait, I remember that the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The spin operator S along a direction is given by (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So for S_y, it should be (ħ/2) * σ_y.

What's σ_y? Oh yeah, the Pauli matrix for y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix is 0 for the diagonal elements and off-diagonal elements are i and -i. Let me write that down:

σ_y = [
[0, -i],
[i, 0]
]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2)*σ_y. That means each element of the matrix is multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, the expectation value is ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. Wait, but wait. Is the state vector given in the correct form? Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, the spinor is usually written as a column vector. So χ is a column vector [3i; 4]. 

So to compute this expectation value, I need to compute χ† * S_y * χ, right? Where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate S_y acting on χ. Then, take the inner product of χ† with that result.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the matrix product directly. Let me think.

Alternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So maybe I can compute the expectation value of σ_y first, and then multiply by ħ/2.

So the expectation value ⟨σ_y⟩ is given by χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute that. χ is [3i; 4], so χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait. Wait, the conjugate transpose of χ is [ (3i)* , (4)* ] which is [ -3i, 4], because the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is real, so stays 4.

So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, σ_y is the matrix:

[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

So when I multiply χ† (which is a 1x2 matrix) by σ_y (which is 2x2), the result is a 1x2 matrix. Then, I multiply that by χ (which is 2x1) to get a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each part step by step.

Let me compute χ† σ_y first:

χ† σ_y = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So matrix multiplication:

First element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 0 + 4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 = (3i^2) +0 = 3*(-1) since i^2 is -1. So that's -3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the multiplication:

First component of χ† σ_y is:

sum_{j} ( [ -3i, 4 ]_j * σ_y_{j,1} )

Which is for j=1: (-3i)*0 = 0.

j=2: 4 * i =4i.

So sum is 4i.

Second component is:

sum_{j} [ -3i, 4 ]_j * σ_y_{j,2}.

j=1: (-3i)* (-i) = (-3i)(-i) = 3 i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

j=2: 4 *0 =0.

So the second component is -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by χ. So [4i, -3] * [3i;4].

Which is (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4) = 12i^2 -12.

i^2 is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12. So the result is -12 -12 = -24?

Wait wait, wait, no. Wait, [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i;4] is:

4i *3i + (-3)*4.

4i*3i =12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3*4= -12.

So sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ is -24? That can't be right because the components of σ_y are
