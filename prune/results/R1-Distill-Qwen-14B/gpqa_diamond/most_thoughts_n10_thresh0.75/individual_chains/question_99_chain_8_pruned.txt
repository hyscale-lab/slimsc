Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by carefully reading the question and the options.

The question states that the compound was analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, there are two complex splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Let me break this down. First, let's consider the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is likely from O-H stretching. But wait, waitâ€”broad peaks in IR can come from either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (amines). However, a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, possibly around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the question says the peak is very broad at 3000. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So that would fit with the 1700 cm^-1 being the C=O stretch.

Now, looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group. So that makes sense. So the IR data points towards a carboxylic acid.

Next, the NMR data. The 1H NMR doesn't show any vinyl hydrogens, so there are no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens. So the molecule must be entirely saturated.

Now, looking at the NMR splitting. Two specific signals are described: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Those are complex splitting patterns, indicating that the protons are being split by multiple neighboring groups.

Wait, let me think about splitting. A doublet of triplets would arise if a proton is
