Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystal structures, but let's try to think this through.

The question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance—I think that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal structure. In a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are all a, b, c, and all the angles are the same, which is the case here since they're all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, so it's a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal, making it a more symmetrical structure.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for calculating the interplanar distance d is given by the Bragg's law formula: d = (a * sqrt(1 - (cos α + cos β + cos γ)/3 )) / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ)) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, there's another approach using the general formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, another formula comes to mind. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by:
d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) ) )

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so α=β=γ=30 degrees. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The general formula for d in a triclinic system (where all a, b, c, and angles are different) is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) - 2 hk (cos γ)/(a b) - 2 kl (cos α)/(b c) - 2 lh (cos β)/(a c) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is the lattice parameter, which is the interatomic distance, 10 Angstroms here), and all angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

So substituting a = b = c = a0, and angles same, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos γ - 2 kl cos α - 2 lh cos β )

But since α = β = γ = 30 degrees, the equation simplifies to:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos 30 - 2 kl cos 30 - 2 lh cos 30 )

Factor out cos 30, which is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So,

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 cos30 (hk + kl + lh) )

But wait, in our case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Substituting h=k=l=1,

d = a0 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(0.8660)*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) )

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, the numerator in the denominator is 1+1+1=3.

The second part is 2 * cos30 * (1+1+1) = 2 * 0.8660 * 3 = 2 * 2.598 ≈ 5.196.

Wait, wait, 2 * 0.8660
