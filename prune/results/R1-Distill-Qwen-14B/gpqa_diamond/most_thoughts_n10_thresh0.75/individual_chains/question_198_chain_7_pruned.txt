Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Wait, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex or maybe another one. Wait, the options are about the percentage of all forms, so I probably have to consider all possible complexes and calculate their proportions.

So, first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of metal-ligand complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The general formula for the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2-n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. The β values are for each step of complexation, I think. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, and so on.

Wait, but how do these β values work? Stability constants are for the formation of each successive complex. So, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise βs. For example, β_total for n=1 is β1, for n=2 it's β1*β2, n=3 is β1*β2*β3, and n=4 is β1*β2*β3*β4.

So, the total concentration of cobalt species will be the sum of all possible complexes: [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], [Co(SCN)₄]. But wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M. That means [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃] + [Co(SCN)₄] = 1e-2 M.

The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is quite
