Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, producing a gas W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with 2 oxygen atoms. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to piece this together.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. They react violently, which makes me think it's a strong reaction, maybe a redox reaction. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule of W is something like H2O or maybe CO2? Wait, no, because the number of neutrons and protons would be same in each molecule. So, for a molecule, the total neutrons and protons should be equal. Let's think about possible gases.

If W is H2O, each molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So the total protons would be 2 + 8 =10, and total neutrons would be 8. Oh wait, that doesn't equal. So H2O doesn't work.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22, neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh, that works! So W could be CO2. But wait, is that a gas produced in such reactions? I'm not sure. Another option is O2, but O2 has each O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 2 atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons would be 16, and neutrons also 16. So that fits. So W is O2?

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, yes. So if W is O2, that would fit the condition. Another possibility is CH4?
