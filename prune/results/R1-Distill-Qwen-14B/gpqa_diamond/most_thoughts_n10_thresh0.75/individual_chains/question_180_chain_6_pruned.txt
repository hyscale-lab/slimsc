Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. So since all the particles have charge 2e, I can note that each has a charge of q = 2e. But wait, what's the value of e? Oh, right, the elementary charge is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

Since the system is isolated, the energy we're looking for is the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Because the particles are point charges, I can use Coulomb's law to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges.

But wait, how do I approach this? I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. Coulomb's constant is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, I'm dealing with multiple charges here. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So all the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but each of those 12 charges is 2 meters away from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other? Because if they are all at 2 meters from P, then each pair among those 12 would be separated by some distance, but I'm not sure what that is. Hmm. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the distance between the 12 charges. It just says each is 2 meters from P. So perhaps they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, but the exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem
