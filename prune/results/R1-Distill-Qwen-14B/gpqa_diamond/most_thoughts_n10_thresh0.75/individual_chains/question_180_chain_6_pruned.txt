Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That would be 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. Hmm. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. Minimum energy... I remember that the potential energy in an electric system depends on the configuration of the charges. To find the minimum potential energy, I think the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, in this case, the twelve charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their positions can't change; they're fixed in a sphere around P. So, I can't change their positions, meaning I need to calculate the potential energy as it is.

Wait, but what's the potential energy of a system of charges? Oh right, the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their final positions. And since the system is isolated, there's no external field affecting them, so we calculate the potential energy between all pairs.

But wait, the charge at P is fixed. So, the other 12 charges are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. So the potential energy is the sum of the potentials from each of those 12 charges on the charge at P, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, no. Because the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, perhaps? Or are they just fixed at 2 m but not necessarily symmetrically arranged? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since they're identical, perhaps the minimum energy would occur when they are placed as far apart as possible, but wait no, because their positions are fixedâ€”so their arrangement doesn't change. So the problem is just about calculating the potential energy between
