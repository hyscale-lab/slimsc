Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says: A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that expectation values involve taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then the state again. But wait, maybe I should break it down step by step.

First, the state is given as ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check if this is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. I'm to find the expectation value of this operator. Since expectation is linear, I can split it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That might make it easier.

So I need to calculate ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩, which splits into 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me tackle each part separately. Let's start with ⟨σz⟩.

σz is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, calculating ⟨σz⟩ should be straightforward.

Wait, the state ψ is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the probabilities times their respective eigenvalues.

The probability of finding spin-up (|↑⟩) is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and probability of spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2=3/4=0.75.

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So the first part is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. But |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So when I apply σx, the state might change.

Wait, perhaps I should represent σx in the σz basis. I remember that σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

Alternatively, another approach: express the
