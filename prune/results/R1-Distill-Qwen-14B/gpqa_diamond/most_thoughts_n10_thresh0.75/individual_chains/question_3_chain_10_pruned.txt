Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it says. A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition, specifically 0.5 uparrow plus sqrt(3)/2 downarrow. The states uparrow and downarrow are eigenstates of sigma z, the Pauli z matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for a state |ψ>, the expectation value of an operator O is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. Oh right, that's the formula.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can probably compute the expectation value by splitting it into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier.

First, I need to find each expectation value separately. Let's start with σz because I think that's simpler. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are just their eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are +1 and -1, respectively. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating the squares: 0.5 squared is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, I remember that σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly compute it as I did for σz.

Wait, the expectation value of σx in a state can be found using the components of the state. Let me think. The state |ψ⟩ is given as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. So ψ can be written as a column vector [a; b], right? Because |↑⟩ is [1;0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1].

So a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2. So the vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute sqrt(3)/2: sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so divided by 2 is about 0.866. So the vector is [0.5; 0.866].

Now,
