Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface that the spots cover. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will come into and out of view as it spins, causing brightness variations that mimic an exoplanet transit. But the question is, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do?

Hmm. So, the problem is comparing the effect of a planet transiting in front of the star (causing a dip in brightness) to the effect of these spots on the star's brightness as it rotates. We need to find the planet radius relative to the star's radius.

Wait, but the spots are on the star, so when part of the star is blocked (like by a planet), the brightness change depends on the area blocked and the temperature difference between the star and the planet. But wait, in this case, the planet isn't blocking anything, the spots are. But the question is saying that the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause. So we need to model the brightness dip from the spots and compare it to the dip from a planet transit.

First, I need to model the brightness variation caused by the spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere and the star is rotating, the brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view. But from our perspective, the spots will cause a dip in brightness when they are in the part of the star facing us. But wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the photometric variations (light curve) look similar to a planet's transit.

Wait, but a planet transit blocks some of the star's light. The dip in brightness depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The area is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But in this case, the spots are causing a dip in brightness because they are cooler. So when the spots are on the visible side, the total brightness is less because those spots are emitting less light.

Wait, maybe
