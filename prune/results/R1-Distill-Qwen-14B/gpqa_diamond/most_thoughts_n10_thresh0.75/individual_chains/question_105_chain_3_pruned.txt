Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the area, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. These spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, mimicking an exoplanet. The question is, if instead of spots, we wanted an exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the planet's radius compared to the star?

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the transit method is used to detect exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the planet's size relative to the star. Bigger planet, bigger dip.

In this case, the star's spots are causing a similar effect. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they contribute less light. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, making the brightness vary. The question is how this variation compares to a planet's transit.

So the key is to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same drop in brightness as these spots do.

Wait, but how does the spot coverage and temperature affect the brightness variation?

I think I need to calculate the change in flux due to the spots. The star's total flux without spots is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less flux.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The filling factor here is 20%, so 0.2. Since it's one hemisphere, I think the total area covered is 0.2 * (2πR² / 2) ? Wait, because a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which is 2πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, each hemisphere is half the star's surface. So if one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, the total area covered on the entire star is 0.2 * (πR²) (since hemisphere's area is 2πR², but wait, no. Wait, a sphere's surface area is 4πR². So a hemisphere is 2πR². So a spot covering 20% of the hemisphere would be 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². Wait, but that's the area of the spots on one hemisphere. So total area of spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star covered by spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) ) = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface. So
