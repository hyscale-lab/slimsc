Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy, I think. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, so 2e each. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, electric potential energy. So I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, but in the context of potential energy.

Wait, so the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when you have multiple charges, you have to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. Because the system's total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But in this case, since one charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2 meters away, maybe it's easier to calculate the potential energy each of the 12 charges at 2m has with the fixed charge, and then consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says it's an isolated system. So all interactions contribute to the total potential energy. So I need to calculate all possible pairs.

But wait, the 12 charges are
