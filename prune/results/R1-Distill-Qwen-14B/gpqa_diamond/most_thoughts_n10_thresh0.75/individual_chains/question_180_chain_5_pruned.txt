Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. That would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the fixed charge is at P, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, I assume we're calculating the electric potential energy of the system. Because in an isolated system, the energy is conserved, and the potential energy would be a significant part of it.

But wait, the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P. The 13th is at P, so each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Oh right, because when you have multiple charges in the system, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise interactions.

So I need to calculate two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me break it down.

First, the potential energy between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges. Since the fixed charge is at P and the others are 2 meters away, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term.

The formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So for each of the 12 charges, the energy is U1 = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well. So each pair would have U = k*(2e
