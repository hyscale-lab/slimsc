Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The astronomers are looking at their luminosities. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so Star_1 is bigger in both radius and mass. But wait, mass might play a role here, but the question is about luminosity, which I think depends more on radius and temperature.

They did spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is 位_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same 位_max, their temperatures must be the same? Because the 位_max would be inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So that implies same 位_max, which implies same temperature. So both stars have the same temperature. So T1 = T2 = T.

Now, the problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. They want to find that factor.

So I need to find (L1)/(L2), given that R1 = 1.5 R2 and T1 = T2.

Wait, but the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect the observed luminosity or the calculation?

Wait, radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the question said they observed the same wavelengths where the stars are brightest. So that's the emitted wavelength, or what is observed? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same for both stars. But considering that the stars might be moving, there's a Doppler shift. So perhaps the observed wavelength
