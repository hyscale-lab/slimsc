Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The task is to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. Oh right, that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation.

So, the problem says that both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Wait, the wavelength at which a blackbody emits most strongly is given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law states that λ_max * T = constant. The constant is about 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2, because λ_max1 = λ_max2.

Wait, but wait. Oh, but wait! The problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that implies that λ_max for both stars is the same. So using Wien's law, T = constant / λ_max. So if λ_max is same for both, T1 = T2. So the temperatures are the same.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

Now, the luminosity of each star depends on R² and T⁴. Since T is the same for both, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1/R2)^2, because T cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but wait
