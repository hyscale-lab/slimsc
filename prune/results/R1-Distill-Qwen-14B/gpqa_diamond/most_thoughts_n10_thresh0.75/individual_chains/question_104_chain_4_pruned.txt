Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The radial velocity method detected these planets.

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet orbits. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift. The amount of shift depends on the star's velocity.

Wait, I remember that the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by some formula involving the star's mass, planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them. Let me try to recall the formula.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. I think the formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 AU)^2 )) ) * (1/( (1 year) ) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the simplified version for when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which it is here since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun.

Wait, yes. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) )) ) ] * ( sin i / ( (1 - eÂ²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 day)) ) )^(1/3) )

But this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the relationship between K, the orbital period, and the mass.

Wait, actually, I think the formula is K = (v) = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for a given planet mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, no, because K depends on the star's velocity, which in turn depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters.

Wait another approach: The star's velocity amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital speed. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. Since the
