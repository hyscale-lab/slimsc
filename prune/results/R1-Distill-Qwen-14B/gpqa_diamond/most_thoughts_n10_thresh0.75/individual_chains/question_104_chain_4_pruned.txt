Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a bit as the planet orbits, and that movement changes the wavelength of the spectral lines we observe.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The RV method detected each. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused 7 milliangstroms. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, so I'm supposed to find Period2 / Period1. Or maybe Period1 / Period2? The question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So that would be Period2 divided by Period1.

How does the RV method relate to the period of the planet? I think the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p^3 / (M_star^2 + M_p)^2 ))^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) * (1 / sin i) ), but wait, perhaps there's a simpler relationship when M_p << M_star. Since the planets are Neptune-like and stars are Sun-like, M_p is much smaller, so M_p/M_star is negligible. So maybe that formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )^(something... Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula. The maximum Doppler shift (which corresponds to the semi-amplitude K) is related to the star's velocity. But the RV shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Wait, the RV method actually gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the
