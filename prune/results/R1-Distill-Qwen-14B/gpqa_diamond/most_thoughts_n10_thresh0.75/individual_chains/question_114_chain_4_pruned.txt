Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible choices for A and B.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when ketones react with certain reagents, they can form different products. The first reaction seems like an addition reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is sodium cyanide. I think in such cases, the cyanide ion (CN-) might add to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but I also recall that adding a nitrile group to a ketone isn't straightforward. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition? Oh right, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So, perhaps the CN- is acting as a nucleophile here.

But wait, when you add a nucleophile to a ketone, like in the case of Grignard reagents or organometallics, you get an alcohol after acid workup. But sodium cyanide is a weaker nucleophile compared to, say, Grignard reagents. So maybe the reaction requires some activation.

Oh, right! I think the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction involves adding halogens to alpha positions, but that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyanohydrin formation. Oh yeah, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. The acid helps protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, and then the CN- attacks.

So for the first reaction, reagent A should be an acid catalyst. The options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, I think. Or wait, wait. Wait, when forming cyanohydrins, the typical reagent is HCN with a catalytic acid. But in the presence of NaCN and an acid, it should work. So for the first step, A is an acid, so either H3O+ or another acid.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, we need an acid. So options A and B are possible.

Now, looking at the first product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN (or CN-) would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the proton from the acid adds to the
