Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Hmm, let me think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide will attack the carbonyl carbon, but wait, what's the product here?

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So adding NaCN (which provides CN-) would lead to a cyanohydrin formation. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. The product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The molecule would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So yes, that fits the cyanohydrin formation.

But for that reaction, what are the conditions needed? I think the addition of CN- to a ketone typically requires an acid catalyst. Oh right, because the carbonyl oxygen needs to be protonated to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid in solution) or maybe something else.

Wait, but
