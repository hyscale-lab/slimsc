Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem provides data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm-1 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The compound might have a hydroxyl group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, such as ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 peak could correspond to an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an amide, but wait, amides have N-H stretches too. But since we already have O-H, maybe it's an ester or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond, perhaps in a conjugated system. Maybe a diene or something like a vinyl group attached to another structure.

Now, the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Common fragments might be a methyl group (15), but 45 is higher. Maybe a CH3CO+ ion? Wait, CH3CO is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43?), no. Wait, 45 could be C3H7O? Alternatively, think of the molecular ion. Alternatively, another common fragment is the acetyl group. But wait, 45 is m/z. Let's think: 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16= 24 +6 +16=46? No, wait 12*2 is 24, H6 is 6, O is 16: 24+6=30, +16=46. Hmm 46 is more than 45. Maybe it's CO2H? No, that's heavier. Wait, another possibility: a ketene ion? Or maybe a CH2O group? Wait, CH2O is formaldehyde, which is 30. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound is one of four: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let me calculate their degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O: C=6, H=12, O=1.
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one ring or double bond.

B) C6H10O: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So same as B, but with two O's.

D) C6H12O2: (12+2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one DoU.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have vinyl H's. So there's a double bond, which is one DoU. So for the options, let's see:

Each option's DoU:

A: 1. So maybe a ring and a double bond, but that would be two DoU. Hmm, wait, wait, it's (2C+2 - H -X + N)/2. Let me recalculate.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2? Wait no, option A is C6H12O2, I think. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So for each:

A: C=6, H=12, O=2. So DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. So maybe a double bond or a ring.

B: C6H10O: DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two rings, or a ring and a double bond.

C: C6H10O2: DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So same as B but with two O's.

D: C6H12O: DoU=(14-12)/2=1. So same as A.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl Hs, which are from a double bond. So each of the options must have at least a double bond. So looking at the DoU:

Option A: 1 DoU. So one double bond or one ring.

Option B: 2 DoU. Could be a ring and a double bond.

Option C: 2 DoU.

Option D: 1 DoU.

So, with the NMR showing vinyl hydrogens, the compound must have at least one double bond. So possible structures could be something with a ring and a double bond, or just a double bond. Now, the FTIR showed a carbonyl around 1700, so maybe an ester or a ketone.

Another clue: the FTIR has a peak at 1650. For esters, the carbonyl is around 1700-1760, but conjugated esters can be lower. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring (like an aromatic ketone or an ester attached to an aromatic ring), or possibly an amide. But we have a broad O-H peak, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Wait, but then the O-H would show a broad peak around 3000, but for a carboxylic acid, the O-H is even broader, around 2500-3300, maybe. Also, the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid is around 1700-1725.

Wait, but in this case, the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Wait, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyl peaks in IR? No, wait, esters have a single carbonyl peak around 1700-1760. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Then, the carbonyl might appear at a lower wavenumber, like around 1700 and another peak due to conjugation elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups. But that's less likely.

Wait another possibility: the peak at 1650 could be due to an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. In benzene, the C=C stretch is around 1450-1600. But if it's conjugated with an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl, it could shift higher. So maybe it's a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, leading to the lower carbonyl peak at 1650. Alternatively, the 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and 1650 is the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. So possibilities include a carboxylic acid (but that would have a very broad O-H), an alcohol, or maybe a phenol. But phenols have broader and stronger O-H absorption, usually around 3200-3600. Wait, the given peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl with an OH group.

But let's think about the possible structures. The options have varying O counts.

Options A and D have one O each (except A is O2, D is O). Wait, no: option A is C6H12O2, so two O's. Option D is C6H12O, one O.

So, if the compound has an OH group and a carbonyl, that would account for two O's. So that would be options C or A.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2.

So, for a structure with both OH and a carbonyl group. Let's think about possible structures.

An ester would have a carbonyl and an OR group. So, for example, methyl propanoate would be an ester. But if there's an OH group in the structure, maybe it's a glycolic acid derivative or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then, the O count would be one, but the formula would include an O from the lactone. Hmm, but perhaps not.

Wait, another thought: if the IR shows a broad O-H peak, that suggests a -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have O-H groups that are broad and strong, and their carbonyl is around 1700. But then, a carboxylic acid would have O2? Wait, no, the formula of a carboxylic acid is RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2.

Looking at the options: option A is C6H12O2, which would fit a carboxylic acid. Let's see: a carboxylic acid would have a molecular formula of CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it would be C6H12O2. So that's option A.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the structure must have a double bond. A carboxylic acid with a double bond? Like hex-2-enoic acid? If that's the case, then the structure would have a double bond and a COOH group. But wait, would that fit the IR data? The 1700 peak would be the carbonyl, and the 1650 could be the conjugated double bond in the COOH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if it's not a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but esters generally don't have -OH; they have OR groups. So maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the O count would be higher. Let's think about the possible structures.

If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), like a six-membered ring, that would have a carbonyl and an ester group. But the O count would be one in that case, but the formula in option D is C6H12O, which would be a lactone with one O. But the ester carbonyl would be around 1700, and maybe the ring would have a conjugated double bond. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, which suggests an alkene, not an aromatic ring.

Wait, another approach. The mass spec peak at m/z=45. Let me think about what fragments would have a mass of 45. The most common would be the acetyl (CH3CO) group, but that's 43. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3COO+ which is 60. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CO group? Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but that's 58. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments. Let me consider the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72+12+32 = 116. So the molecular ion would be at 116. But in mass spec, the fragments would be lower. The peak at 45 could be a fragment. Let's see: possible fragments from 116.

If the molecule is a diol ester or something, perhaps losing a part. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a CH3COO group. So, if the molecule is something like CH2CH2COO... Wait, maybe a propionate ester. If the molecule is something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene is O=C=O, but that's heavier. Hmm.

Wait, another common fragment is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller part of the molecule. For example, in a molecule with a methyl group attached to something else, the loss of the rest could leave a methyl group. But 45 is higher than that.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. Close, but not 45.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me calculate possible combinations:

45 = 12a + 1b + 16c.

Looking for a combination where a, b, c are non-negative integers.

Possible combinations:

- 3 carbons: 12*3=36. 45-36=9. 9 could be 1*9 (but 9 isn't 16). Or 16? 45-36=9, so maybe 3 carbons, no H, O? No. Alternatively, 3 carbons and 9 H? Impossible because 3 carbons at max have 6 H. Alternatively, perhaps 2 carbons: 24. 45-24=21. 21 can be (1*21?), but 16*1=16, 21-16=5. So 2 carbons, 5 H, 1 O? Let me see: 24 (2*12) +5 (5*1) +16 (1*16) = 24+5+16=45. So formula is C2H5O. That could be something like CH2CH2O, but more accurately, maybe a fragment like CH3COO- (if it's a negative charge, but in mass spec, it's positive ions). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2CH2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the methyl group plus something else. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group. Let me see: C3H7 would be 3*12 +7=43, which is close to 45 but not quite. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group with an extra O? But that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe it's the (CH3)2CO+ ion. That's acetone ion, which is 58. No, that's too high.

Another approach: think of the molecular formula and possible functional groups. Since the IR shows an O-H and a carbonyl, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. So, the molecular formula would be CnH2nO2. So for n=6, C6H12O2, which is option A.

Then, the mass spectrum could have a fragment that's the COOH group losing something. Wait, the COOH group is 60 (12+16+16 + (O2)). Hmm, but 45 is less than that.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the methyl group from an ester. For example, if the molecule is methyl something, the loss of the rest could leave a methyl group. But methyl is 15, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from a cleavage in the molecule. Let's say the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOH (but that's propenoic acid, C3H4O2). But the options here are six carbons.

Wait, but if it's an ester, say, ethyl something. The molecular formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for a six-carbon ester, perhaps the ester is something with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone with a double bond. How would that affect the mass spec? Maybe cleaves to form a fragment with O and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 45 is the loss of something. For example, if the molecular ion is at 116 (option A), losing 71 would give 45. But I don't know what would give 71.

Wait, what is the molecular weight of each option:

A) C6H12O2: (6*12)=72 + 12*1=12 + 2*16=32 → 72+12=84 +32=116.

B) C6H10O: 6*12=72 +10=82 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

So the molecular ions would be at 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), 100 (D).

In the mass spec, the fragment at 45 is lower than all these, so it's likely a part of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: if the fragment is 45, maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is 58? No. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)3O group. (3*12 + 6 + 16=36+6+16=58). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, 45 could be C3H7O+. Let's see: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's 59. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's C2H5CO+. That would be acetate: 2*12 +5 +12 +16=24 +5 +12 +16=57. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, think of 45 as being (CH3)COO-. Wait, that's 45? (12*2 +3 + 16*2)=24 +3 +32=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the formula O=C=O, but that's 44 (16*2 +12=44). But 44 is close to 45. Could it be a charged fragment? Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO group. CH3CO+ is 43. So 43 is close. But the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be from a CH2CH2O group. Let me calculate: 2 carbons (24) +5 H (5) +1 O (16) → 45. So 24 +5 +16=45. So the formula would be C2H5O. What structures have that? That could be a fragment like CH2CH2O, but that's ethylene oxide? No, ethylene oxide is C2H4O, which is 44. Wait, but 45? So perhaps an oxygenated fragment like CH2CH2O+ with an extra H? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO-O- group. Wait, that's 43 + 16=59. Hmm, not matching.

Another angle: The compound has a carbonyl group and an O-H group. So it's either a carboxylic acid, an alcohol with a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde), or an ester with an alcohol group (which is unlikely).

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

The NMR shows vinyl H's, so there's a double bond in the structure. So the structure would be a carboxylic acid with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. But that would have more than six carbons. Wait, no, if it's a six-carbon chain, maybe the double bond is near the COOH group. For example, pent-4-enoic acid. Wait, that's C5H8O2, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclohexene carboxylic acid. So a six-membered ring with a double bond and a COOH group. That would account for the vinyl Hs.

In that case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Because cyclohexene has the formula C6H10.

Wait, but wait: cyclohexene is C6H10. If it has a COOH group, the formula becomes C6H10O2. Which is option C. So the formula would be option C.

Wait, but looking back at the IR, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. If the structure is a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond (cyclohexene) would have a peak around 1650. That fits the IR data.

So the FTIR would show a broad O-H around 3000, which matches the carboxylic acid. The 1700 is the carbonyl, and 1650 is the conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl Hs, which are present in the double bond.

What about the mass spec? The fragment at 45. If the structure is a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, would any fragment give 45? Let's think: the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114. A fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule.

Wait, what's the molecular formula of the fragment that gives m/z=45? C=2, H=5, O=1: C2H5O. So molecular formula is C2H5O, which is 45 (2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45). So the fragment could be a -CH2CH2O group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule undergoes a loss of a part, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, losing the cyclohexene part and retaining the COOH group? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps during the fragmentation, a CH2COOH group is lost, but that would leave a larger fragment. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible options.

Option C is C6H10O2.

If it's a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond and a COOH group. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which fits option C.

The IR would show O-H (carboxylic acid, broad around 3000), a carbonyl around 1700, and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

The NMR shows vinyl Hs, which are present in the double bond.

In the mass spectrum, a fragment of 45 would correspond to C2H5O. How does that happen? Well, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller part. For instance, if the cyclohexene ring breaks, maybe a two-carbon fragment is released.

But I'm not entirely certain, but based on the IR and the presence of two oxygens, the structure likely has both a carbonyl and an O-H group. So, a carboxylic acid with a double bond would fit best.

Another thought: the presence of two oxygen peaks in IR (carbonyl and O-H) suggests two oxygen atoms, so the formula must be either A, C, or another with two O's.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2.

So, the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


The unknown compound's spectroscopic data provides several key clues:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond, respectively.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a fragment with the molecular formula C₂H₅O (2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
  This formula corresponds to a carboxylic acid with one degree of unsaturation. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests the compound must have a double bond, which would require an additional degree of unsaturation. This makes option A unlikely.

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:  
  This formula has two degrees of unsaturation. While it could accommodate a double bond, the presence of two oxygen atoms (as suggested by the IR peaks) rules out this option.

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
  This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and includes two oxygen atoms. A plausible structure is a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, which would have a conjugated double bond (explaining the 1650 cm⁻¹ IR peak) and a carbonyl group (explaining the 1700 cm⁻¹ IR peak). The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ aligns with the carboxylic acid functionality. The vinyl hydrogens in the NMR are consistent with the double bond in the cyclohexene ring. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a C₂H₅O fragment, which is plausible for this structure.

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:  
  This formula has one degree of unsaturation and only one oxygen atom. The IR data, which indicates two oxygen atoms (O-H and C=O), rules out this option.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula analysis point to **C₆H₁₀O₂** as the most consistent option. This corresponds to a cyclohexene carboxylic acid, which explains the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data.

**Answer: C**
