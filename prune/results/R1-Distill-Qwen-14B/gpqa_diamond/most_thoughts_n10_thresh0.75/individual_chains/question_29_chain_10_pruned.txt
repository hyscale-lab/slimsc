Okay, so I have this question about barley and gene mutations. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. I need to look for which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Wait, the question says that the changes are in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so any mutations here could affect the protein product. So I need to look for mutations that cause a frameshift or a stop codon.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, comparing to the intact, the first few bases differ. Let's align them.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Hmm, looking at the first part, the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT..., and Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, let me compare each position:

First 8 nucleotides in intact: ATGTTTCTC
Mutant1: ATGTTCTAC

Wait, so in the first 8, the intact is 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Wait, maybe I should look at the exact differences. Let's see the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning, the first part of the intact gene is ...TTTCTC... and the mutant is ...TTCTAC...

Wait, perhaps I should write the first part:

Intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So the first few bases differ. Let me count:

First, the first 12 nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait
