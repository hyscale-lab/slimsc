Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Let's look at the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around this region usually indicate the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Also, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, what could those be?

1700 cm-1 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). Like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe even carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm-1 peak is a bit lower than 1700. Could that be an conjugated carbonyl group, maybe? Or perhaps an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's a conjugated double bond or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in alkenes. So this compound probably has a double bond. That suggests maybe an ester, because esters have carbonyl groups and can have double bonds elsewhere, or perhaps something like a ketone with a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments with 45 include things like CH3CO+ (which is 43?), wait no, maybe something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment, maybe a methyl group with some other atoms. Or perhaps it's the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. Alternatively, could it be a carbonyl group plus something else?

Let me consider the molecular formulas provided:

Option A: C6H12O2. So, degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one degree, which could be a ring and a double bond, or just one double bond and a ring.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2= 2. So two degrees, maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond, but that's less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees: (12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees: (12+2-12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

Now, looking back at the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. The IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So maybe an ester (which has two oxygen in the formula, so either A or C) or a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, the FTIR also has a broad peak around 3000. If that's O-H, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid, then the compound would have an -OH group. But looking at the options, which ones have O? All except B have O. Wait, option B is C6H10O, which has one O. So if there's an O-H, then the compound has at least one O. So options A, C, D have two, one, or two O's respectively.

Wait, another thought. If the broad peak is from O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes higher. But the IR here has 1700 and 1650. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl around 1700-1750. The 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond.

Wait, or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Because the ester carbonyl is around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. That makes sense. So the presence of a vinyl proton in the NMR suggests a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So the structure might be something like CH2=CHCOO R, or similar. Let's think about the molecular formula. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the molecular formula for an ester would be something like CnH2nO2. Let's check the options. Option A is C6H12O2, which would fit an ester. Let's see, for C6H12O2, the general formula for an ester is (assuming R is (n-1) carbon and R' is m, then n+m+2=6? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the degrees. Since it's an ester (RCOOR'), the formula is Cn+1+m H2n+2m+2 O2? I'm not sure, perhaps better to approach formula via degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, the unknown is an ester with a double bond. So structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 or something similar. Let's calculate the molecular formula for such a compound. Let's say it's CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be: 3 carbons from the ester part (CH2CH2CH3?), wait no, the ester group is O-CO-O.

Wait, the example I was thinking is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be 3 carbons on the ester's R (CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons, but that's a butyl group?), wait no, the ester would be CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is something. Let me count the carbons: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons
