Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with wave functions and normalization. Hmm, I remember that wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. 

The problem states that each particle has a wave function given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but usually the wave function is a complex number, so having a real and imaginary part makes sense. But the modulus squared of the wave function should give the probability density. 

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So, the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Oh, but wait a minute, that can't be right. Or maybe that's correct? Because in the Schr√∂dinger equation, the wave function can have both real and imaginary parts.

But the question says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function should be zero outside this region, but in the given wave function, it's defined in a part where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. 

Wait, no. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But how does that fit into the possible regions? Because the measurement shows that the particle is only found between 1 and
