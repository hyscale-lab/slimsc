Okay, so I need to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. Hmm, let's start by understanding the interaction.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the notation might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it. Oh right, in particle physics, the interaction term usually involves the field coupling to fermion fields. So, I think the term is something like λ times a Yukawa coupling, where X is the boson field, and the fermions are ψ_f and their adjoints.

But wait, the structure looks like the Yukawa term: L ~ g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f, which are probably Dirac fermions. The term would look like λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f, perhaps. But the given expression is a bit unclear; maybe it's written as f-bar times X, multiplied by some parameters.

But perhaps the exact form isn't necessary for determining the decay modes. The key is the mass of X and the possible fermions it can decay into.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. To decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So, for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So I need to list all possible fermions where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's list the masses of known fermions:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~106 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- For neutrinos, but I think in this case they might be neglected if the interaction term doesn't include them.

So let's calculate 2m_f for each:

u: 4 MeV, so 2m_u is 4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
d: ~8 MeV → allowed.
s: ~190 MeV → allowed.
c: ~2.6 GeV → 2.6 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
b: 9 GeV → 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.
t: way too big, so no.
e: 1 MeV → allowed.
μ: ~212 MeV → allowed.
τ: ~3.56 GeV → 3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.

Wait, wait. So for the quarks, u, d, s, c are possible, but b is too heavy. For leptons, e, μ, τ are possible since 2m_τ is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV.

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is given as involving ψ_f, which are the fermions that X can interact with. So, for each fermion f, if the term allows X to couple to f and its anti-particle, then X can decay into f f-bar.

So let's look at the interaction term again. The term is written as -λ f ψ_f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding this. Maybe it's supposed to be a Yukawa coupling term where X interacts with a fermion and its anti-fermion.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as λ f (ψ_f-bar) X ψ_f. So for each fermion f, the interaction is such that X can decay into a pair of f and f-bar.

But wait, let's think about the possible fermions. The question is about the allowed decays, so the possible fermions are those that X can couple to, given the interaction term.

Wait, the interaction term is given as L = -λ f f̄ (y) [v + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the notation right. Maybe the term is L = -λ f ψ_f-bar X ψ_f. But perhaps the 'f' here is a flavor index, indicating that the coupling is to fermions of a certain type.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct term is L = λ ψ_f-bar X ψ_f, but with some
