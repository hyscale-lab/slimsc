Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo or maybe a formatting issue. Oh, wait, the user probably meant L(y) = -λ f f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's supposed to be a Yukawa-like interaction term. Oh right, maybe it's L = -λ f ψ_f (y) f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y) or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating that part. Maybe the exact form of the Lagrangian isn't as crucial as understanding the interaction.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I think I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs the boson can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

From what I remember, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because, you know, energy and mass are related through E=mc², so the rest mass energy of the fermion pair can't exceed that of the boson.

So first, I need to list all the possible fermions that X can decay into, considering their masses. Let's think about the fermion masses. Let's see:

- The electron (e) is very light, about 0.0005 GeV.
- The muon (μ) is heavier, around 0.1 GeV.
- The tau (τ) is much heavier, about 1.777 GeV.
- The quarks: up (u) and down (d) are light, but their masses are around a few MeV, so negligible compared to 6 GeV. The strange quark (s) is heavier, about 100 MeV. The charm (c) quark is around 1.5 GeV, bottom (b) around 4.7 GeV, and top (t) is super heavy at about 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV.

Wait, wait. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. So m_X is 6 GeV.

Let's calculate 2m for each fermion:

- e: 2*0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV → much less than 6 GeV. So allowed.
- μ: 2*0.1 = 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- τ: 2*1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV → allowed.
- u quark: 2*~5 MeV = 0.01 GeV → allowed.
- d: similar to u, about 0.01 GeV. Allowed.
- s: 2*100 MeV = 0.2 GeV → allowed.
- c: 2*1.5 = 3 GeV → allowed.
- b: 2*4.7 = 9.4 GeV → 9.4 >6 GeV. So not allowed.
- t: 2*173 ≈ 346 GeV → way too big. Not allowed.

So the possible fermions where 2m_f ≤6 GeV are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but does the interaction term in the Lagrangian matter here? The problem gives the interaction term as L = -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the fermions are the ψ_f and f? Maybe I'm not getting the notation right. Wait, the term is λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems a bit odd because f and ψ_f are both fermion fields. Maybe f is a Dirac spinor and ψ_f is something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term, like λ ψ_f X ψ_f, implying that the coupling is to
