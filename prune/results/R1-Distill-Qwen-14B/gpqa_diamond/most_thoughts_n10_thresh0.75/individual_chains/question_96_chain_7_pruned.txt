Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole at a distance of d = 10^10 parsecs is θ = 10^-17 degrees. I'm supposed to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's, gravitational, and Boltzmann's. But I think when we write the entropy formula, it's often approximated as S ≈ (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), but I need to get the exact expression right.

So first, I probably need to find the radius of the event horizon, also known as the Schwarzschild radius. The formula for that is R_s = (2 G M) / (c^2). But wait, if I have the angular size θ, I can relate that to the actual size (the diameter of the event horizon) and the distance d. Right, θ is the angle subtended at the observer's eye, so using small angle approximation, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance. So θ ≈ diameter / d.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². The diameter would then be 2 R_s, which is 4 GM/c². Oh no, wait, no. No, diameter is 2 R_s, which is 2*(2GM/c²) = 4 GM/c²? No, no, wait: R_s is 2GM/c², so the diameter would be 2 R_s, which is 4 GM/c². Wait no, R_s is 2GM/c², so diameter is 2*(2GM/c²) = 4 GM/c²? No, wait, diameter is twice the radius. So if R is 2GM/c², then diameter is 2*(2GM/c²) = 4 GM/c²? No, no, wait, R_s is 2GM/c², so the diameter is
