Okay, so I've got this problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh right, and A for a black hole is like a sphere, so A = 4π r², where r is the Schwarzschild radius.

But first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon's angular size θ is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance. Wait, but θ is small, so maybe θ ≈ (2r)/(d), because for small angles, the tangent is approximately the angle in radians. So, r ≈ (d θ)/2.

Wait, let's get the units right. The distance d is given in parsecs, and θ is in degrees. I think I need to convert everything into consistent units, probably meters and kilograms.

First, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees multiplied by π/180.

θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, let me calculate that roughly: π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/(180) is about 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. That seems right.

Now, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. One parsec is about 3.086e1
