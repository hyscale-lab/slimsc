Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me break this down.

Hmm, benzene is the starting material. I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents can direct the incoming groups to certain positions. So I need to think about the order of adding these substituents to get the correct positions.

The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let me think about their positions. The numbering would be such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, in benzene rings, the numbering starts at a specific substituent to give the lowest possible numbers. Let me visualize the structure: the positions are 1, 2, and 3, right? So it's a meta arrangement for some of them.

Each substituent has an effect on the ring's reactivity. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating, but probably ortho/para-directing group as well, since it's an alkyl substituent.

Wait, but the order matters a lot. Because once you add a substituent, the next one will direct based on the existing substituents. So I need to plan the order of adding these groups to get them in the correct positions.

Let me think about the target: 2-(tert-butyl) is position 2, 1-ethoxy is position 1, and 3-nitro is position 3. So the substituents are adjacent to each other. Wait, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are all next to each other. Hmm.

What's the best way to approach this? Maybe the nitro group is a meta director, so if I add that later, it might direct where the other groups go. Alternatively, adding activating groups might help.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added first. Because once you have an ethoxy group, it's activating and directs ortho and para. Then the next substituent would go into an ortho or para position relative to it. But since in the target, the tert-butyl is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy at position 1. Then the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho/para to tert-butyl? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first as a meta director. Let's see: if I nitrate the benzene first, adding a nitro group, say, at position 1. Then, I would add another substituent. But the ethoxy group is an activating group, so it needs to be added after the nitro if possible. Wait, no, because nitro is deactivating, so the ring would be less reactive. If I add ethoxy after nitro, that might be difficult because nitro is meta-directing, and the ethoxy is activating. Wait, but adding ethoxy after nitro might not be straightforward because the nitro is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution, but I might have to use a strong enough electrophile.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's think through that. If benzene is first eth
