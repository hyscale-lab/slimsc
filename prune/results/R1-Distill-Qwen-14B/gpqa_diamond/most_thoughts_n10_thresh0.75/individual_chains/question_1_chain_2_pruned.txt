Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let's say E2 is higher than E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, this ΔE must be significantly larger than the uncertainties in each state's energy. Or perhaps, I should think that the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe each state's uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution depends on the energy uncertainty being much smaller than the energy difference. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements, which comes from the lifetimes.

But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because each state's energy has an uncertainty due to its own lifetime. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈6.5e-8 eV. But when comparing E1 and E2, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Or maybe the individual uncertainties are small enough that their energy difference is easily distinguishable.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the energy resolution of the measurement. That is, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainties, then you can clearly distinguish the two levels.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.

The uncertainty principle for energy and time says that the energy uncertainty ΔE is at least ħ / τ. So for each state, the energy is uncertain by about ħ/τ. So for E1, the uncertainty is ~6.5e-7 eV, and for E2, ~6.5e-8 eV. 

But when we observe the energy levels, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but the options provided are in the range of 1e-11 to 1e-4 eV. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001 n eV. 

Option B: 1e-11 eV. That's 0.01 p eV. 

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.1 meV, which is a much larger energy difference.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.01 n eV.

Wait, the uncertainties I calculated were 6.5e-7 eV for E1 and 6.5e-8 for E2. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than, say, the sum of these uncertainties, which is about 7.16e-7 eV. So a ΔE of 1e-7 eV or higher would be needed. 

Looking at the options, none of the options are that big. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy width of each state. The energy width is approximately the uncertainty ΔE. So the energy levels can't be resolved if their energy difference is less than the sum of their widths.

So for E1, the width is approximately 6.5e-7 eV, E2's width is ~6.5e-8 eV. So the sum is about 6.56e-7 eV. The energy difference must be larger than this sum to be resolvable.

So the smallest possible ΔE that is clearly resolvable would be just a bit larger than 6.56e-7 eV. But looking at the options, all are smaller than 1e-7 eV except option C (1e-4 eV). Because 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger than 6.56e-7. So that would be easily resolvable.

But wait, the options don't have anything above 1e-7 eV except option C. Wait, no
