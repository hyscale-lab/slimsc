Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then it asks about tautomerism and optical isomerism in two different compounds. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism has to do with the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, like in enols and ketones. Optical isomerism is when compounds have chiral centers, making them able to rotate plane-polarized light.

The problem gives two parts: part A and part B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Let me tackle part A first. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I think has two carbonyl groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, can it undergo tautomerism?

Tautomerism usually requires adjacent H and double bond, like in a carbonyl. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the two ketones are opposite each other, so maybe they can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent H. Or wait, maybe it's about whether the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to have tautomerism, it needs to have an alpha Hâ€”like in a carbonyl group, an adjacent H that can shift. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, each on a benzene ring. But the benzene ring's carbons don't have Hs attached to the carbonyl C. Wait, no, the benzene is C6H4, so each ring carbon is bonded to the quinone. So the carbonyls are on the ring. Each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring, so they don't have H's attached to the carbonyl C. So no alpha Hs. Therefore, no tautomerism possible.

What about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at 1,3,5 positions. So each ketone is on a carbon adjacent to the ring. Do the carbonyls have alpha Hs? Let's think. For each ketone group (O=C-), the adjacent carbons are attached to the ring and possibly other substituents. Wait, in the cyclohexane ring, each of the three ketones is on C1, C3, C5. So each of those carbons is attached to two ring CH2 groups and an O. So, wait, the carbonyls are O=C-R, where R is the cyclohexane ring. So the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to two CH2 groups, but wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring is six-membered, each of the three carbonyl carbons (C
