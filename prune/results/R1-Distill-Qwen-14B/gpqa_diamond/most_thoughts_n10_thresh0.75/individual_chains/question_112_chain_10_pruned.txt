Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about an electron's spin state. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, S_z |up> = (ħ/2)|up> and similarly for |down>.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what does that matrix look like?

Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. And the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Hmm, I think this operator might be related to spin in a different direction, maybe the x or y direction? Wait, the Pauli matrices! The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Oh wait, but the operator here isn't exactly a Pauli matrix. Let me compute the operator more carefully.

Wait, the operator's matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So that's actually (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling by ħ/2 gives us exactly the matrix given. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, or am I mixing up the notation? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So yes, this operator's eigenvalues would be ±(ħ/2). Because if σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then multiplying by ħ/2 gives eigenvalues of ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x. What are those? Oh right, the eigenstates of σ_x are the spin states in the x-direction. They are |right> and |left>, perhaps. The eigenstates can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), or something like that.

Wait, to be precise: σ_x |+x> = |+x>, and σ_x |−x> = −|−x>, up to a sign. The eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for the +1 eigenvalue and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for the -1 eigenvalue, but wait, perhaps I have the signs mixed. Let me recall: σ_x is (|up><down| + |down><up|). So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and
