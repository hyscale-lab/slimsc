Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answers for parts A, B, and C of the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Michael reactions, but I'll try to think through each step.

First, let me recall what a Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically a carbanion, like an enolate, which attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. This results in a new carbon-carbon bond formation.

So, the problem gives me three separate reactions, and I have to determine the reactants and products. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A:
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I think the first step is to identify which compound is the Michael donor (the nucleophile) and which is the Michael acceptor (the electrophilic alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl).

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. It's a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. In the presence of a base like NaOEt, it should deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon.

The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=C(p-Tol)-COOEt, with the E configuration. Since the acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, it acts as the Michael acceptor.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acceptor. The attack will occur at the less substituted carbon? Wait, no, the Michael addition typically occurs at the beta carbon, which is the more substituted one because of the better stabilization of the transition state, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, the enolate attacks the less substituted beta position because the more substituted is more stabilized as an electrophile. Hmm, maybe in this case, the structure is CH2-C-(p-tolyl) with the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the carbonyl at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH-p-Tol with the double bond between the first and second carbon, and the carbonyl is on the third, attached to the methyl ester.

Wait, no, wait: the formula would be CH2=CHCOOEt, but with p-tolyl substituting one of the CH2 groups. So, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-COOEt where one CH2 is replaced by p-tolyl? No, wait, acry
