Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian is given, and I see a few terms. The first term is i\bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R, which looks like a kinetic term for a right-handed neutrino. Then there's (1/2)(∂^μ φ)^2, the kinetic term for the scalar φ. The next term is |D^μ S|^2, which suggests that S is a scalar field that's charged, maybe a doublet because it's in a 2 representation.

Then there's a term -(y_i/2) φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. Wait, \bar{N}_iR^c would be the charge conjugate, so that's like a Yukawa term coupling φ to the right-handed neutrinos. And then a term -g_{iα} \bar{N}_{iR} L_α S. Oh, so L_α is probably the lepton doublet (like the left-handed lepton fields), and S is a scalar doublet. So this term is mixing the right-handed neutrinos with the lepton doublets and S.

The potential V(φ, S, H) is also there, but I don't know exactly what it looks like. The fields are given: N_iR are singlets (1,1,0), S is a doublet (1,2,1), and φ is a singlet (1,1,0). Wait, the charges must be under SU(2), U(1)_Y, then SM. So S is a doublet, meaning SU(2) charge 2/2=1, U(1) hypercharge is 1. Because for SU(2) doublet, the Y is 1, so that each component has hypercharge Y/2. Hmm, maybe I should think about that later.

The vevs are given as <φ>² = x² + v², where <φ> =x and <h>=v. Wait, no, the way it's written: the expectation value of φ is x, and the expectation value of h is v. But wait, φ is a singlet scalar. So in the potential, φ gets a vev, and h is another field, perhaps part of the Higgs field?

Wait, the problem refers to the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Oh, right, in models with multiple Higgs fields, sometimes you get multiple Higgs bosons. The Higgs mechanism when you have a doublet S and another singlet φ, perhaps. The Goldstone bosons would come from the broken symmetry. But if some of them are eaten, others remain as physical Higgs particles.

Wait, the Higgs field in the Standard Model is usually a doublet. Here, we have S as a doublet and φ as a singlet. So perhaps S has components that get vevs. But the vev is given for φ. Wait, the problem says ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v². So the vev of φ is x, and the vev of h (which I'm not sure where h comes in) is v. Wait, h is another field? Or is h the same as φ? No, because the problem says ⟨h⟩=v. Hmm, perhaps the Higgs in the SM is the h, while φ is another scalar.

Wait, the potential V(φ, S, H) suggests there are more fields involved. Maybe S is the usual Higgs, and φ is another singlet. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the symmetry breaking.
