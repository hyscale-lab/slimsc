Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that there's a small peptidic compound, and the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals that add up to 1H. So, each peak is about half a proton? And the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling, so that's ruled out. 

Then the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So each peak is the same molecule, but maybe in different forms.

Wait, possible reasons for duplicate peaks in NMR. One common issue is coupling, but the question says that's ruled out. So maybe it's something else. Another possibility is that the proton is split into two due to something else, like maybe the molecule is in different conformations or has different environments. 

Now, the LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass but same mass spec. So same molecular weight, same molecular formula. So maybe the same compound but in different forms, like diastereomers or enantiomers. Or maybe it's a peak splitting due to something else?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with precursor. If that's the case, the mass would be different. But the question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, so the extra peak wouldn't be the same mass. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass spec. But in 1H NMR, enantiomers would look identical because the environment is the same. Unless it's a chiral column in LC, but the question doesn't say that. So in NMR, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton because the enantiomers would have identical structures. Wait, but in the NMR, the peaks are for the same alpha proton but are split. Maybe it's something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling is when a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Like if a proton is next to two different J values. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation. So maybe not this one.

Option D: Mixture
