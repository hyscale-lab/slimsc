Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my classes.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used, so r and θ make sense here. The task is to find the energy spectrum, which means finding the possible energy levels the particle can have.

Wait, energy levels in quantum mechanics usually come from solving the Schrödinger equation for the given potential. So I should probably write down the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates for this V(r, θ).

The general form of the time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is something like:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

So substituting the given potential into this equation. Let's write that out:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) - (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] ψ = E ψ.

Hmm, I can see that the potential has two terms: one that's purely radial (proportional to r²) and another that depends on cos²θ, which suggests an angular dependence. I'm thinking this might lead to the equation being separable into radial and angular parts, but perhaps with some modification.

Wait, maybe I can separate the variables ψ(r, θ) = R(r) Θ(θ). Let's try that. So substituting ψ = R(r) Θ(θ) into the Schrödinger equation.

Plugging into the equation:

(- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) (Θ) ) + (1/r²) R (d²Θ/dθ²) ) ] ) + V(r,θ) RΘ = E RΘ.

Divide both sides by RΘ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R)) d/dr (r dR/dr) ) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ) ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E.

Hmm, so the equation separates into parts involving only R and Θ. Let's rearrange terms to separate into radial and angular parts.

Let me bring the terms involving R and Θ to opposite sides:

(1/(r R)) [ - (ħ²/(2m)) (d/dr (r dR/dr)) ] + [1/(r² Θ)] [ - (ħ²/(2m)) (d²Θ/dθ²) ] + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = E/(R Θ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to collect the terms such that each side depends on only R or Θ. Let me think about how to do this.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

[ - (ħ²/(2m r
