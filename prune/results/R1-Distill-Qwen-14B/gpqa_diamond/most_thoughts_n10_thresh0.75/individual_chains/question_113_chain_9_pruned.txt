Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let's think through this step by step.

The question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Because alcohols have an O-H stretch that's usually broad because the hydrogen bonds cause it to be so.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak. That could be a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or something like that. The 1650 is a bit lower, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Or perhaps a conjugated double bond. Oh wait, 1650 could also be an amide, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not that. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe the carbonyl is around 1700, but then what's 1650? Maybe a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR, it says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, right? So the molecule has at least a double bond. Maybe an alkene somewhere.

The Mass Spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. A m/z of 45 could correspond to a CH3CO group. Like, maybe the loss of a larger fragment leaves behind a CH3CO which is 45 (since CH3 is 15, CO is 20, but wait, I think the actual calculation is 12+3*(1) + 16 + 16= 45? Wait, CH3CO would be C2H3O2? No, wait, no. Wait, CH3CO is actually C2H3O2? No, wait, wait. Let me calculate. Carbon is 12, each H is 1, oxygen is 16. So CH3CO would be 2 carbons: 12*2=24, 3 H's in CH3: 3*1=3, 1 H in CO? Wait, no, wait. CO is in the fragment. Wait, maybe it's a ketene or something. Alternatively, maybe it's the tropylium ion, but that's more like 91. Hmm, wait, 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2CO+? Wait, no, (CH3)2CO is acetone, but that's (CH3)2CO: molecular weight is 58 (12*3 + 6 +16). Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone group. Wait, 45 could be CH3COO− but in positive mode? Not sure.

Wait, another thought. 4
