Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I think this has to do with complex ion formation and maybe the formation constant.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The solution has 0.02 M of stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other reactions affecting the EDTA availability. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10.

Wait, the formation constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, right? So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or something like that. So K is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution. Stochiometric usually means that the moles of each reactant are in the exact ratio required by the balanced equation. So if the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- must have been such that they formed this complex completely, assuming no reverse reaction? Or is it in equilibrium?

Wait, but K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number. That suggests that the formation of the complex is very favorable, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So at equilibrium, the concentration of free Ca²+ and free EDTA would be very low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M.

But in solution, some of this complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but because K is so large, the dissociation is minimal. So the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are very small.

Alternatively, because the solution is stochiometric, perhaps all the Ca²+ and EDTA have been consumed to form the complex. But that's only true if the solution is prepared by mixing equal moles of Ca²+ and EDTA^4
