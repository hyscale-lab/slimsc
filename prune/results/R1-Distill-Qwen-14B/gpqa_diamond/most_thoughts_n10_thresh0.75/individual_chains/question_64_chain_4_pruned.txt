Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200Â°C without air, and only a mixture of gases was formed. Then, this gas mixture was passed through three tubes. The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gained 3.60 grams, tube 3 gained 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight didn't change. After that, there were 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think each tube is reacting with specific gases in the mixture. Let's consider each step.

First, the setup: when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gas(es). Then, these gases pass through the tubes.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water. But wait, what's in the gas mixture? Maybe the gases are moisture-laden. So, perhaps the gas contains water vapor. Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water, so the weight increase in tube 1 is due to water. So 3.60 grams is the mass of H2O absorbed. 

Let's compute the moles of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So, 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 moles of H2O.

Then, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, meaning no reaction. What could that imply? Well, if the gas mixture has CO2, then Ca(OH)2 would react to form CaCO3 and water, increasing the weight. But since it didn't change, maybe CO2 wasn't present. Or perhaps there was another reason, like the gas didn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas wasn't acidic. Hmm, perhaps the gas isn't CO2. Or maybe the solution was saturated or something. Not sure yet.

Tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So, likely the gas is a reducing agent. Cu is heated, so maybe the gas is something like H2, CO, maybe NH3? Wait, but these would react with Cu. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is a sulfur-containing compound, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the product is CuO, which suggests oxidation. So, the gas must be something that can oxidize Cu. Wait, but Cu is in a red-hot state. For instance, if the gas is H2, it can
