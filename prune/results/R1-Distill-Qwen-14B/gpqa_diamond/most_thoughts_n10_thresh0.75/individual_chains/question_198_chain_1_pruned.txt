Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in determining the predominant species in a solution. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the different complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, the β's are given in some order, but I need to figure out which β corresponds to which complex.

I think β is usually for the formation of a complex from the metal ion and ligands. So for Co(II) with SCN-, the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n increases. Typically, the first complex (n=1) has β1, then β2 for n=2, etc. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^-2, and [Co(SCN)4]^-3? Or wait, maybe the charge depends on the number of ligands. Each SCN- is -1, so for Co^2+:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ would be 2+ + (-1) = +1. So Co(SCN) has one SCN.
- [Co(SCN)₂]⁰: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0, so neutral.
- [Co(SCN)₃]^-: 2+ + 3*(-1) = -1.
- [Co(SCN)₄]^-2: 2+ +4*(-1) = -2.

But I'm not sure if the numbering is correct. Anyway, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So that's the second complex, β2=40.

The problem is asking for the percentage of this particular complex among all Co species. So I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] in the solution.

To find this, I should use the stability constants and the given concentrations to determine the distribution of each complex. The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations based on the β values and the ligand concentrations.

The formula for the fraction of a particular complex is given by the product of the stability constant for that complex and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms for all complexes (including the free ion).

Wait, more precisely, the fraction f for the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + β1β2β3 [L]^3 + ... + β1β2...βn [L]^n )

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each β is the cumulative stability constant up to that complex. Or wait, each β in the list is for the specific complex. Wait, no, I think each β represents the stepwise formation constant. Or wait, the way the question presents β1, β2, etc., probably each is the overall formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex. So for each complex, the stability constant is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. Wait, no, maybe each β is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, the β is β1=9. For [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, it's β2=40. For [Co(SCN)3]^-2, β3=63. For [Co(SCN)4]^-3, β4=16.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if β increases, the more stable the complex, but β
