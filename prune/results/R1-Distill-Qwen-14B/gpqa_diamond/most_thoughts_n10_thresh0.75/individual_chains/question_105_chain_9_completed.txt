Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The filling factor is 20%, which I remember is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. The question is about how the brightness variations caused by these spots compare to those caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. They want to find the radius of such a planet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. Right, when a planet transits its host star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the star's spots will cause variations as the star rotates and the spots come into and out of view.

I think the key here is to calculate the relative brightness change due to the spots and then find the planet size that would cause the same change.

So, first, let's model the star's brightness without any spots. The total luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when part of the star's surface is covered by cooler spots, the total emitted light decreases.

The filling factor, f, is 20% (0.2). Each spot has a temperature of (6000K - 1000K) = 5000K. So the spots are cooler.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The flux from the spotted regions is Fs = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4, where ΔT is 1000K. So each spot emits less flux.

The average flux from the star when the spots are present would be F_avg = F0 * (1 - f) + Fs * f. But wait, actually, the spots cover a fraction f of the surface. So the total flux is the sum of the unspotted and spotted parts.

So the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) when the spots are present is (F_avg - F0) / F0. Let me compute that.

F_avg = (1 - f) * F0 + f * Fs.

ΔF = [ (1 - f) F0 + f Fs ] - F0 ) / F0
= [ (1-f) F0 + f Fs - F0 ] / F0
= [ -f F0 + f Fs ] / F0
= f (Fs - F0) / F0
= f ( (σ (5000)^4 ) - (σ (6000)^4 ) ) / (σ (6000)^4 )
Oh, the σ cancels out.

So ΔF = f * [ (5000^4 / 6000^4) - 1 ]

Wait, wait: Since each spot is cooler, the flux from them is less than F0. So F_avg is less than F0, leading to a decrease in brightness, which would cause a dip. But in the question, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots coming into view as the star rotates. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer, and when they're on the far side, it's brighter? Or wait, no—since it's a hemisphere covered, perhaps the star presents the spots as it rotates, causing periodic dimming.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me compute the fractional change due to the spots.

Wait, actually, when the star is not spotted, F0 is the flux. When part of the surface is covered by spots, the total flux is F_avg = F0 * (1 - f) + f * Fs. So the change in flux is F_avg - F0 = F0 [ (1-f) + f (Fs / F0) ) - 1 ] = F0 [ -f + f (Fs / F0) ] = F0 [ f ( Fs/F0 -1 ) ].

So the fractional change is (F_avg - F0)/F0 = f ( Fs/F0 - 1 )

Wait, Fs is the flux per unit area of the spot, which is (T_spot / T_eff)^4 multiplied by F0 (since F0 = sigma Teff^4).

So Fs = F0 * (5000/6000)^4.

So Fs/F0 = (5/6)^4.

So ΔF = f * ( (5/6)^4 - 1 )

Wait, because Fs is less than F0, so (5/6)^4 is less than 1, so (5/6)^4 -1 is negative. But since the star's brightness is decreasing, the fractional change is negative, but when we talk about amplitude, we just take the magnitude.

So let's compute that.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4 = 625; 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 -1 ≈ -0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * (-0.51775) ≈ -0.10355.

So ΔF ≈ -0.10355, so the fractional change is about -10.355%. But since we're looking for the amplitude, the magnitude is about 10.355%.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is (F_avg - F0)/F0. Wait, F_avg is when the spots are visible—so the star emits less, so the change is negative. So the fractional change is -0.10355. But the amplitude is the absolute value, so 10.355% drop.

But the question says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So to produce the same amplitude, we need the planet to cause a dip of the same magnitude.

The dip caused by a planet is when the planet blocks part of the star's light. The dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is (R_planet / R_star)^2 * area of the star. Since the flux is proportional to the area, the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the star's effective temperature is used in the flux calculation, so when the planet blocks a part of the star, the change in flux is (Rp/Rstar)^2, assuming that the entire area is at Teff. But wait, in reality, the star's disk area is Rstar^2, and the planet blocks a circle of area (Rp)^2. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the fractional dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need this dip to be equal to the amplitude caused by the spots, which is ~10.355% (approx 0.10355).

So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.10355.

Then Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316, so 0.32 is around there.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close to this value.

Wait, let's double-check the calculations.

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4 = 625.

6^4=1296.

625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (5/6)^4 = 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775? No, wait, no, the (Fs/F0) is 0.48225, so (Fs/F0 - 1) is -0.51775.

Wait, but wait, when you have the filling factor, the total flux is F_total = (1-f) F0 + f Fs.

So the change in flux is F_total - F0 = f (Fs - F0) = f (F0*( (5/6)^4 ) - F0 ) = F0 * f ( (5/6)^4 - 1 )

So the fractional change is [F0 * f ( (5/6)^4 - 1 ) ] / F0 = f ( (5/6)^4 - 1 ) ≈ 0.2 * (0.48225 - 1) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) = -0.10355, which is about a 10.355% decrease.

So the amplitude is 0.10355, about 10.355%.

So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32, which is very close.

Wait, but wait a minute, let me think again. The question says that the star's other hemisphere is not spotty. So when it rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible, but in reality, as the star rotates, the spots would come into view over time, leading to a sinusoidal-like variation, but the amplitude of the variation is the maximum dip, which is the same as the fractional change we calculated.

But perhaps I have made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, (5/6)^4 is (0.83333)^4. Let me compute that step by step.

0.83333^2 is approximately 0.69444. Then square that: 0.69444^2 ≈ 0.48225. Yep that's correct.

So 0.48225 is the Fs/F0. So (Fs/F0 - 1) is -0.51775.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * (-0.51775) is -0.10355. So 10.355% dip.

So the planet's radius ratio squared would be 0.10355, so sqrt(0.10355) is approx 0.3217. So about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32.

Wait, but let me check the other options:

Option A is ~0.39: that's about sqrt(0.152), which is higher than our value.

Option C is ~0.11: which is sqrt(0.0121), way too low.

Option B is ~0.07: sqrt(0.0049), way too small.

So the correct answer should be option D, ~0.32.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered in spots, so when it's rotating, the spots would be on the limb. Oh wait, no, the brightness variation would depend on the rotational phase. But for the maximum amplitude, perhaps the spots are fully visible when the star is rotated such that the spot side is facing us. But the way the calculation is done, we took the average change. Wait, perhaps the model is that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the brightness changes as the spots come into and out of view, but maybe the maximum dip is when the spots are directly facing us.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation more accurately. Let's think: when the star is unspotted, brightness is F0. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the brightness is lower. But wait, the star's spots are on one hemisphere, so when it's facing us, the spots are on the front, causing a dip, and when it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us, so the brightness is higher than F0.

Wait, that can't be right, because the overall brightness would vary between F_avg (with spots on the far side) and F_dim (with spots on the near side). So the average brightness would be somewhere in between. But the maximum variation would be between F_avg and F0.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the average brightness as the time-averaged brightness. Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness varies between (1 - f) F0 (if the non-spotty side is facing us) and F0 (if the spotty side is facing us—actually, no, wait, if the spotty side is facing us, then it's F_avg = (1 - f) F0 + f Fs, which is lower than F0. So the brightness varies between F_avg (when spots are facing us) and F0*(1 - f) + f Fs ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me model it more accurately.

The star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere (f=0.2) is covered with spots, and the other is normal.

When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotted = (1 - f) F0 + f Fs.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_non_spotted = F0.

So the variation in flux is between F_spotted and F_non_spotted. The amplitude would be the maximum change from the average.

Wait, perhaps the average flux is the average between these two states. But the star is rotating, so during each rotation, the flux goes from F_spotted to F_non_spotted and back, leading to a periodic variation.

Wait, but the exact maximum dip would occur when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. Let me think about the maximum and minimum brightness.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_avg = (1 - f) F0 + f Fs = F0 [ (1-f) + f (Fs/F0) ].

Wait, but Fs = F0 * (T_spot / Teff)^4.

So Fs/F0 = (5000/6000)^4 ≈ (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_avg = F0 [ (1 - 0.2 ) + 0.2 * 0.48225 ] = F0 [0.8 + 0.09645] = F0 * 0.89645.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.89645 F0. When the non-spotted is facing, it's F0.

So the variation in flux is between 0.89645 F0 and F0. The amplitude of the variation would be the difference between F0 and 0.89645 F0, divided by the average.

Wait, but for a light curve, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the average, perhaps. Wait, no, the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation, but perhaps in this context, it's the depth of the dip.

In the case of the planet transit, the amplitude is the dip when the planet blocks part of the star, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the dip caused by the spots is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted) / F_non_spotted.

Wait, when the star is in the spotted state, the flux is F_spotted = 0.89645 F0. When it's in the non-spotted state, the flux is F_non_spotted = F0.

So the dip when the spots are visible is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted) / F_non_spotted = (F0 - 0.89645 F0) / F0 = 0.10355, which is about 10.355%.

So the amplitude is 10.355%, so the planet's transit dip should be the same: (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3217.

Which is close to option D, 0.32.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another approach: perhaps the effective temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000 K, but the filling factor is 20%. So the overall brightness change is the area of spots (f) times the difference in flux per unit area.

The flux from unspotted area is F0, and the flux from spotted area is Fs = F0 * (5000/6000)^4.

So the average flux when the spots are fully visible is F_avg = (1 - f) F0 + f Fs.

Which is F0 [ (1 - f) + f (Fs/F0) ].

Which is F0 [1 - f + f (5/6)^4 ].

The fractional change when the spots are visible is (F_avg - F0)/F0.

So (F_avg - F0)/F0 = [F0 (1 - f + f (5/6)^4 ) - F0 ] / F0 = ( -f + f (5/6)^4 ) = f [ (5/6)^4 - 1 ].

Which is the same as before, leading to a fractional change of approximately -0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355%, so the planet's radius must be such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3217.

So the correct answer is D, ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the star's dark spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun's radius.
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - Filling factor of spots: \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The total flux from the star is reduced when spots are visible. The flux from the spotted regions is lower than the flux from the unspotted regions.
   - The fractional change in brightness is given by:
     \[
     \Delta F = f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 - 1
     \]
     Substituting \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \), we compute:
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \times (0.48225 - 1) = 0.2 \times (-0.51775) \approx -0.10355
     \]
     The amplitude of the brightness variation is the absolute value, \( |\Delta F| \approx 0.10355 \) or \( 10.355\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Signal**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots (\( 0.10355 \)), we set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3217
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - Option A (\( \sim 0.39 \)): Too large, corresponds to a much greater dip.
   - Option B (\( \sim 0.07 \)): Too small, corresponds to a much smaller dip.
   - Option C (\( \sim 0.11 \)): Too small, corresponds to a much smaller dip.
   - Option D (\( \sim 0.32 \)): Closest to the calculated value of \( 0.3217 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option D.
