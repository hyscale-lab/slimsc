Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C and 277 is 4°C. 

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with substance X contains two atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, that makes me think of something like a strong base or maybe a metal that's reactive. 

And the question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X. Plus, if there are multiple instances, we have to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes. So I need to figure out what elements are in X and their isotopes.

Let me break this down. Let's start with the reaction details.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is around 277 K. So B is a solid at 277 K. I think about what substances have that melting point. Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps more likely, maybe something like sodium bicarbonate? Wait, no, sodium bicarbonate's melting point is higher. Or water? No, water freezes at 273 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So a solid that just starts to melt around there. What about something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Hmm. Maybe some other substance.

Wait, if B is a solid at 277 K, maybe it's a solid at room temperature. Let me think about possible compounds. Another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate and B is CO2? Or maybe a bicarbonate. Wait, but heating a carbonate usually gives CO2 and a metal oxide. For example, heating sodium carbonate gives sodium oxide and CO2, but sodium oxide is a solid. Wait, but the melting point of B is 277 K. Hmm. Alternatively, if B is a solid that's a byproduct.

Wait, perhaps B is water? No, because water's melting point is 273 K, not 277. Alternatively, maybe B is some other substance. Let me think about another angle.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So same number of n and p, meaning the molecule is made up of elements where each atom has n = p. Because in a molecule, each atom contributes its own n and p. So for the entire molecule, the total neutrons equal the total protons. Wait, but each atom has n = p. So if it's a molecule of hydrogen (H2), each H has 0 neutrons and 1 proton. So two H's: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That doesn't work. What about a molecule where each atom has equal n and p. For example, carbon-12: 6
