Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs. The spectrographs are ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I need to figure out which stars are observable by both.

Wait, the question gives me information about each star, including their magnitudes and distances. Oh right, the key is to find out which stars are bright enough to be seen by both instruments.

Let me first recall the details. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be detected by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, no—because the problem says stars brighter than those magnitudes. Oh wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, but wait—apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter (has a lower V mag), it's more detectable.

Wait, so for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag ≤17 can be observed, because brighter (lower mag) is better. So, the limit is 17. For HIRES, stars must have V mag ≤16. So, a star must be ≤16 mag to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO. Thus, for a star to be detected by both, it must have V mag ≤16, because that's the stricter limit.

But wait, some of the stars have absolute magnitudes, and some have apparent. So I think I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for stars that only give absolute magnitude, or adjust for interstellar extinction for those that have it.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent mag is the same as absolute mag when distance is 10 pc. So V =15.5. That's brighter than both 16 and 17, so it's detectable by both. Because 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it, and less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5. That's more than 16, so HIRES can't observe it because HIRES requires mag ≤16. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 is less than 17? Wait, no—wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So stars with V ≤17 can be observed. So Star2's apparent mag is 16.5, which is less than 17. So, Star2 is visible by ESPRESSO. But since Star2 has 16.5 which is above 16, it's not visible by HIRES. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5, but there's E(B-V) =0.6 mag. Wait, the note says
