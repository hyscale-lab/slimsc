Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that the brightness of the star matters because each spectrograph has a different limit. Let me think about what I know.

The problem gives me some data about each star. Each star has RA, DEC, magnitude details, distance, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)). I think the key here is to figure out each star's apparent V magnitude because that's what the telescopes' brightness limits are based on.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V mag 17. So anything with V mag less than 17 (which means brighter) can be seen. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So it's more sensitive, needing brighter stars (lower magnitude numbers are brighter). 

Wait, no, wait. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". So ESPRESSO can see stars with V up to 17, but HIRES can see up to 16. So if a star has V mag less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. If it's less than 16, HIRES can see it. So for a star to be seen by both, what's needed?

Wait, no, I think I got that reversed. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 (like 16 or 15), ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16. So a star that's brighter than 16 would be seen by both. But if a star is between 16 and 17, only ESPRESSO can see it. But for this question, the star needs to be detectable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because that's what HIRES requires. Because if a star is V=16.5, like Star2, it's fainter than HIRES can see but within ESPRESSO's range, right?

Wait, let me clarify. Each spectrograph has a limit on the apparent magnitude: ESPRESSO can take data for stars brighter than 17, which is
