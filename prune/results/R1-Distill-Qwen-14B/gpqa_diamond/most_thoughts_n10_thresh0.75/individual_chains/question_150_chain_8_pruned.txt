Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's break down the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 =10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is three degrees) and some double bonds and a ring or maybe another double bond or a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe an aldehyde group is present.

Then, 6.98 is a doublet (d) with 2H. 6.51 is a doublet, also 2H. These look like aromatic protons, perhaps from a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into a doublet each when next to adjacent protons, but wait, wait. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are actually a singlet if the substituent is such that the ring is symmetrical. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in the para positions. Alternatively, if there are substituents that cause coupling, like in ortho positions, but the doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. Wait, perhaps it's a pair of doublets for a para-substituted ring. Like in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene where each substituent is in para, but perhaps with another group causing the coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a vinyl group.

Wait, looking again, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Broad singlet could be something like an NH proton, but that's usually around 1-5 ppm, unless it's an aromatic NH, but wait, 6.27 is more downfield, but maybe it's an enol proton or something else. Alternatively, maybe these are two protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a -CH2-O- structure. Hmm, but not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Putting this together, the structure likely has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 triplet), a benzene ring (from the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets), maybe another aromatic
