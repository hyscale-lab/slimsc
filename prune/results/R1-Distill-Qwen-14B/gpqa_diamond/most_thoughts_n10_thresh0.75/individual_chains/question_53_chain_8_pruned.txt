Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester group absorption. Esters typically have strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹, so that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down.

First, two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Wait, so the aromatic ring has two sets of Hs. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the splitting. For example, if it's para substitution, you might have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But if it's ortho, the splitting could be more complex. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in a position that splits the aromatic protons into two different environments.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds, like in alkenes or possibly as part of an ester group. The ester group structure is R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R', so maybe the vinyl is part of the substituent on the ring.

Wait, and there are two signals for -CH3 groups. Two sets of methyl groups. But no -CH2 signals. So the structure must have two types of methyl groups, each in different environments. So that suggests that the substituents on the benzene might each have a methyl group, and perhaps other parts as well.

So, putting this together, the molecule has an ester group. Let's think about possible structures. Ester groups could be attached as substituents on the benzene ring. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else.

Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents. Let's think about the ester. An ester has the structure RCOOR'. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR', and the other substituent could be another group with a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an est
