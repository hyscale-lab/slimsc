Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. So, the question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, they're 15 and 10. We need to find out how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocities of the two stars are related to their masses. Oh right, the more massive star moves slower because it's being pulled by the less massive one, so their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So like, if one star is twice as massive, it has half the velocity of the other.

And I think the formula involves the mass function, which relates the velocities to the masses. Or maybe it's the center of mass thing. Let me recall. The center of mass requires that m1*v1 = m2*v2, right? So the mass ratio is m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio would be m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half of m2, meaning the total mass is m1 + m2 = 0.5m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. So the total mass of system_1 is 1.5 times that of system_2? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because I'm not considering the orbital period yet.

Wait, no, the period is the same for both stars, right? Since they orbit each other, their orbital periods are the same. So the period is the same for both stars in the same system. But here, the periods are different between the two systems. Hmm, but the problem gives each system's own period.

Wait, the period for system_1 is 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. Oh, so each system has its own period. So I need to find the mass of each system based on their own data.

Wait, I think Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula for binary stars using Kepler's law is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the stars. But I don't have a, but maybe the radial velocities can help.

Alternatively, the mass function. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary gives the mass of the companion relative to the primary. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocities give the velocities of each star in their orbit. The more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's moving less for the same gravitational pull. So the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses.

For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio m1/m2
