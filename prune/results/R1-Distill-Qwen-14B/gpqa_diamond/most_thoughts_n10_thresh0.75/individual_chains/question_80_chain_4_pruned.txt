Okay, so I've got this problem here where I'm given some DNA sequences and their corresponding numerical outputs. My task is to figure out the pattern or the rule that's converting these sequences into numbers, and then apply that rule to a new sequence to find its output. Let's break it down.

The first example is AGG -> 115. Hmm. The second one is TGCTGA -> 176. I need to find what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351. 

Let me start by thinking about how DNA sequences are converted into numbers. DNA is made up of the nucleotides A, T, C, G. Each of these has a specific weight, but I'm not sure if that's the approach here. Alternatively, maybe it's about the position of each nucleotide in the sequence or some other property.

Looking at the first example: AGG. Let's write down the positions:

A G G

Wait, the output is 115. Let me think about the individual letters. Each letter could be assigned a numerical value. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 maybe? Let me test that with the first example.

A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So adding them up: 1 +4 +4 =9. But 9 is nowhere near 115. So that can't be the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide contributes a specific value, but perhaps as a digit in a number, like base 4 or something else. Let me see. For AGG, if each letter is a digit, perhaps in base 10? But 1,4,4 would be 144, which is way bigger than 115. Or maybe base 5? 1*25 +4*5 +4 =25+20+4=49. No, not 115 either.

Wait, another approach: maybe each nucleotide's position in the sequence is multiplied by its numerical value. So for AGG, positions 1,2,3. A is 1, G is 4. So 1*1 + 2*4 + 3*4 =1 +8 +12=21. Still not 1
