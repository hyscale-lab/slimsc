Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. The multiple-choice options give possible factors by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let's break it down. First, the star's parameters without spots: 1.5 solar radii, 1.1 solar masses, effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall.

The problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Hmm, but wait, the wavelength given is 1448 Å, which is 144.8 nm, so that's in the extreme ultraviolet or X-ray? Wait, no, 100 nm is X-ray, so 1448 is 144.8 nm, which is in the far UV, maybe near the Lyman series. But I'm not sure if that's important right now.

The key here is understanding the ratio of populations in two energy levels. Assuming LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio should follow the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two states to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

But wait, the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2, I think. Because the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me think. The ratio is level 1 over level 2. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower. Let's see what that does to the ratio.

Wait, lower temperature would affect the exponent. The
