Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about stars and their photospheric effective temperatures, and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, sounds a bit complex, but I'll try to untangle it.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that when parts of the star are cooler (like spots), the overall brightness decreases. Oh, right, because the spots are darker than the surrounding photosphere. So the star emits less total light when spots are present.

The main question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, I'm guessing this has to do with the Saha equation, which describes the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

The Saha equation relates the number of ions to the electron density and temperature. But wait, the problem is about neutral atoms in two energy levels, so maybe it's not ionization but excitation. Oh, right, that's a different equation. The Boltzmann equation comes into play for energy level populations.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. The ratio (n2/n1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight and E is the energy difference.

In this case, the ratio is n1/n2 (since the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present). Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, and the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, so when the temperature goes down, what happens to the ratio?

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. Let's think about the Boltzmann factor. If E2 is higher than E1, then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ). Wait no, the Boltzmann equation is n_i = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(kT) ) ) * n_j. So for level 1 and 2, assuming E2 > E1, then n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So the ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ).

Wait, wait, let me get this straight. Let me define E1 as the lower energy level and E2 as higher. Then the Boltzmann factor for n2 compared to n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT)
