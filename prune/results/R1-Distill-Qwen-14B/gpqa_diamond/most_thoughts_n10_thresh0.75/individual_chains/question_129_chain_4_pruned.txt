Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let's see what each step entails.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four possible compounds, all of which are cyclic ketones.

Let me start by analyzing the IR data. The strong peak around 1750 cm^-1 in compound A suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The same for E, but at 1715, which is a bit lower, so maybe a different environment, like a conjugated ketone or maybe a ring strain affecting the carbonyl stretch.

Looking at hint a), when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's parse that structure.

The product is a cyclopentane ring. At positions 1 and 2, there are methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent with a double bond. So, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, which is connected to the cyclopentane at position 4.

Wait, but the product is from A reacting with a ylide. Ylides are typically involved in Wittig reactions. Wittig reagents (ylides) react with carbonyl groups to form alkenes.

So if A has a carbonyl group and when it reacts with a ylide, it forms an alkene, then A must have been a ketone or aldehyde. Since the product after the Wittig has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that includes an alkene (propan-2-ylidene), perhaps A is a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane has two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at 4, a substituent that's propan-2-ylidene, which is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be: the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-, attached via the CH2? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent with a double bond, meaning the cyclopentane has an exocyclic double
