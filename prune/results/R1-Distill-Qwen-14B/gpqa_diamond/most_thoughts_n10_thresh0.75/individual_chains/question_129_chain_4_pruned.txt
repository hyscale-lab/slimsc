Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that compound E is identified through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps: A to B with HCN, B to C via reduction with H2 and Pd, C to D with HNO2, and D to E by elimination of an inert gas. There are also two hints provided.

First, I'll outline each step to see what kind of reactions are happening.

1. A + HCN → B
2. B + H2 (Pd) → C
3. C + HNO2 → D
4. D → E (elimination of inert gas)

Then, the hints:

a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR of A has a peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is strong. IR of E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones. So E must be a ketone, perhaps, given the IR. Let's think about that.

IR peaks: 1750 cm^-1 is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, esters, maybe aldehydes. The shift can vary based on the structure. For example, strong electron-withdrawing groups can lower the wavenumber. So if A has a higher carbonyl peak than E, maybe E's carbonyl is more substituted or in a different environment.

So, looking at the reaction steps:

Step 1: A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, like in ketones, forming cyanohydrins. So, if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would add a cyanide group to the alpha position, forming an alcohol and a nitrile adjacent. Wait, no, HCN adds to the carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, B would be a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but another possibility is if A is an aldehyde. Then HCN would add to it to form a primary alcohol with a nitrile. But the options for E are all ketones, so maybe E is a cyclic ketone, perhaps.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, probably of nitrile groups. Wait, Pd is usually for hydrogenation of alkenes or alkynes, but nitriles can be hydrogenated too. Oh, but H2 with Pd is more about hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe double bonds. Wait, nitriles (CN) can be hydrogenated to amines. So if B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would convert CN to CH2NH2? No, wait, hydrogenation of nitriles usually gives amines. For example, RCN + H2 (with catalyst) → RCH2NH2. But that's under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps B has an alkyne or an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe HCN adds to a carbonyl group, making a cyanohydrin which is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile. Then, when B is reduced, perhaps the nitrile group is hydrogenated to an amine. But in the presence of Pd and H2, maybe the double bond is hydrogenated. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure of B is something else. Let me think about the possible structures.

Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, a phosphorous ylide is used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes. So, compound A must have
