Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Wait, meta means each of them is separated by one carbon, so each is at a 120-degree position from each other. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so meta would be two positions apart. So if one substituent is at position 1, the other two would be at 3 and 5, right? Or maybe I should think of them as being meta to each other, meaning each pair is meta.

Wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the other two. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me visualize this. Let's imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the positions 1 through 6. Suppose the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, since the carboxylic acid is meta to the carbaldehyde and the cyano group, the carbaldehyde would be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5? Or maybe another arrangement.

Wait, no. If all three are meta to each other, each must be two positions apart. So if one is at position 1, the next would be at 3
