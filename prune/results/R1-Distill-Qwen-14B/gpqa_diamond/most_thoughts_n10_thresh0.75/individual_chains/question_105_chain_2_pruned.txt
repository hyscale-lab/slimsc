Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about how the brightness variation of a star with spots compares to the dip caused by an exoplanet transit. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal in the light curve as the spotted star does.

Alright, let's parse the problem again. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations. But we're supposed to compare this scenario to an exoplanet transit, which would cause a dip in brightness as the planet blocks some of the star's light.

Wait, but the question says that if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would give the same amplitude. So maybe I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the variation caused by the planet, then solve for the planet's radius.

Let me think about each part. First, how do the spots affect the star's brightness? The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer. The brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has 20% spots. But wait, the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². Spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so spots' area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, I think the filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered. So when the star rotates, we see spots only on one side. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spots are on one side. But since the star is rotating, the spots come into view and then go away, making a periodic brightness change.

So the brightness change due to the spots is the difference between the spotted and unspotted regions. The brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature relative to the rest of the star.

Let me get into the math. The total brightness (luminosity) of the star without spots would be L = 4πR² * σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. So the spotted area contributes less.

The area of the spots is A_spots = filling factor (f) * area of the hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, the hemisphere area is 2πR². So A_spots = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

The temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000K, so 5000K.

The total luminosity when the spots are visible would be:

L_spotted = (L without spots) - (L of spotted area) + (L of spotted area at lower temp)

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, L_spotted = (unspotted area * flux) + (spotted area * flux at lower temp).

Yes, that's better. So the unspotted area is (hemisphere area - A_spots) + the other hemisphere, which is all unspotted when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, no. Because when we're looking at the star, we see one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is not visible. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star's brightness is reduced because 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots. So the visible area is 0.8 * (unspotted part of the hemisphere) plus 0.2 * (spotted part).

Wait, but the star's rotation brings different parts into view. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of the star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by spots, but only on one hemisphere. Since we're considering the star's rotation, the spots come into view as the star rotates, causing the brightness variation.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So regardless of rotation, each hemisphere is either spotted or not. Wait no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere (the one facing us) that's covered when the star is observed. So when the star rotates, the same side comes into view, and 20% of that is spots.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify: the star's surface has spots covering 20% of each hemisphere. No, that can't be, because if all hemispheres are like that, the spots would always be there, and brightness wouldn't vary. So perhaps the star's surface is such that one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of it, and the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the star rotates, we see spots when that hemisphere is facing us, and no spots when the other hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but that would mean that the brightness variation is maximum when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible, and minimum when the non-spotty is visible. But the problem says that the spots are on one hemisphere, and the other is clear. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, which has 20% spots, and when it's not, the other hemisphere is spot-free.

Wait, no. I think the correct setup is that the star's surface is spotted on one side. So when that side is facing us, we see the spots, and when it's facing away, we don't. So the brightness variation is due to the spots being in view or not.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. The total brightness variation would be the difference between when the spots are
