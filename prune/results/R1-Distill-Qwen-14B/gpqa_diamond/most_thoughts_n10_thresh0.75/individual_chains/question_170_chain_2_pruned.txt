Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

Wait, what's the Pauli matrix σ_y again? Oh right, σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And the spin state ψ is given as (3i, 4). So, the vector is a column vector with first component 3i and second component 4. Let me write that as ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

But wait, to compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose, I need to take the complex conjugate of each component and then transpose. So ψ is a column vector, ψ† would be a row vector with [3i, 4] → after conjugation, it becomes [-3i, 4], because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, since i's conjugate is -i. Wait, wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. So 3i's conjugate is -3i, right? So ψ† is the row vector [-3i, 4].

So, the expectation value <S_y> is ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ.

Let me write this out step by step.

First, write out σ_y:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So, first, compute σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let's compute that matrix multiplication.

σ_y * ψ = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) , (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T ?

Wait, no, matrix multiplication for σ_y (2x2) and ψ (2x1) gives a 2x1 vector. Let's do each component.

First component:
(0)*(
