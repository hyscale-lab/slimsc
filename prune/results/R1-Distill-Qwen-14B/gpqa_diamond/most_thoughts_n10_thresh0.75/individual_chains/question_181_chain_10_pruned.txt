Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, the effect on the neutrino flux here would be observable after that light-travel time. But for the purpose of this question, I think the timing part is just there to set the context that the change has happened and we're considering its effects now.

The question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux1/flux2. I need to find this ratio.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core, right? The proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different steps in this process.

I remember that the pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions. Specifically, in the pp-III process, a proton (or a hydrogen ion) captures a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) to form a boron-8 nucleus (B-8), which then decays into lithium-7 (Li-7) and a helium-4 (He-4) by emitting a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, actually, I think the main neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the decay of B-8 into Be-8 and then into two He-4s, emitting two neutrinos per B-8 decay. Or wait, maybe each B-8 decay emits eight neutrinos, but most are low-energy and only a few reach the detectors. But I think the main point here is about the neutrino production sources.

Wait, the pp-III branch is the dominant source of neutrinos in the Sun, right? Because most of the Sun's neutrinos come from the B-8 decay, which is from the pp-III process. So if pp-III stopped, the neutrino
