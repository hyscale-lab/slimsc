Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun and how it changes when a particular branch of reactions in the Sun's core stops. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, pp-III, each producing different neutrinos.

Oh right, the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos. I think these are the ones that come from the fusion of helium-3 into helium-4. The neutrinos produced here have higher energies, around a few MeV or so. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce lower energy neutrinos, but maybe in higher quantities?

The question is asking about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what determines the flux in each band?

Neutrinos are produced at different energies depending on which reaction is happening. The pp-III branch, when active, contributes more to higher energy neutrinos. If pp-III stops, its neutrino production ceases, which would reduce the higher energy flux. But what about the lower energy ones?

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is the main contributor to the high-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the high-energy flux (like band 2) would drop, but the lower energy bands (like band 1) wouldn't be as affected, especially if the other branches continue.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV (like the 8-B neutrinos), which I think fall into the higher energy bands. So band 2 is 800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV. Hmm, but the 8-B neutrinos are higher than that. So maybe band 2 is just below the typical 8-B neutrinos. Or wait, no, 800 keV is 0.8 MeV, and 900 is 0.9. So the 8-B neutrinos are at about 1.42 MeV, which is above band 2. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the higher energy bands (like above 1 MeV) would drop, but what about the bands below, like 0.7-0.9 MeV?

Wait, but the question is about the flux in bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So stopping pp-III would affect higher energy neutrinos, but what about these bands in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range?

I think the lower energy bands are dominated by other processes. Let me recall, the dominant solar neutrinos are the 7Be and 8B. The 8B are from the pp-III branch and have higher energies, around 14 MeV? Wait, no, wait. I think the 8B neutrinos are actually around 14 MeV? Or wait, no, that can't be. Because the 8B is a decay product of 8B, which is created in the pp-III branch. The 8B is a Boron-8 isotope that decays into Be-8, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. So the 8B neutrinos have an energy around 1.42 MeV.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. The 8B neutrinos are emitted when 8B decays into 8Be, which then decays further. The neutrino emitted in this decay has a energy of about 1.42 MeV. So the 8B neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV. So band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is lower than 1.4 MeV. So the 8B neutrinos would fall into a higher band than band 2.

Wait, but then what produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range? Maybe the 7Be (Beryllium-7) neutrinos. The 7Be neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be into 7Li, emitting a neutrino. Their energies are around 0.86 MeV. Oh, that's right around the band 2 (800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV). So the 7Be neutrinos would be in band 2.

Oh wait, no, 0.86 MeV is in band 2. So if the pp-III branch stopped, would that affect the 7Be neutrinos?

No, because the 7Be neutrinos are from a different part of the proton-proton chain. The 7Be is produced in the pp-I branch, I think. The pp-I branch is the main proton-proton chain, leading to 7Be, then captures a proton to become 8B, which then goes into the pp-III branch. So the 7Be is part of the pp-I branch.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of 8B would stop, but the 7Be would still be produced as usual. So the 7Be neutrinos would continue as before, but the 8B neutrinos would stop.

Wait, but the 8B neutrinos are from the decay of 8B. So if the pp-III branch stops, the 8B would no longer be produced, so the 8B neutrinos would drop. But the 7Be neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be, which is produced in the pp-I branch. So their production would continue unless the pp-I branch is also affected.

So, the question is about the flux ratio between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). Band 1 is lower than band 2. So what neutrinos contribute to each band?

Band 1: 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV). Are there any neutrinos in this range? Well, the 7Be neutrinos are around 0.86 MeV, which is higher than band 1 but in band 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, 0.86 is in band 2 (0.8-0.9), so band 1 would not have as much contribution from 7Be.

Wait,
