Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it through carefully and figure out what's going on.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, each representing different symmetry groups.

First, let's break down the reactions step by step.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - Hmm. Solid reacting with gas to form a red product. I'm thinking maybe a metal reacting with chlorine or another diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents—that's a lot. For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na. Wait, but here it's 8 equivalents of B. Maybe it's a reaction where each molecule of A bonds with multiple B molecules. Alternatively, maybe A is something like aluminum reacting with a diatomic gas. Let me think. Another possibility is that A is a transition metal. Alternatively, perhaps A is an alkali metal oxide. Or wait, perhaps the reaction is something like the formation of a metal chloride. For example, magnesium reacts with chlorine: Mg + Cl2 → MgCl2. But that's 1:1. Wait, but 8 equivalents of B suggests that each A uses 8 B molecules. So if B is Cl2, then each A would combine with 8 Cl atoms. So A must be a divalent metal? Wait, 8 Cl atoms would mean 4 Cl2 molecules. Because each Cl2 gives 2 Cl atoms. So if 8 Cl atoms are needed, that's 4 Cl2 molecules. So the reaction would be A + 4Cl2 → ACl4^? No, wait. Let's think stoichiometrically. If A is Na (which has a valency of +1) reacting with Cl2, the formula would be NaCl. So 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So for each Cl2 molecule, 2 moles of Na are used. So if A is Na, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with 16 moles of Na. Hmm, but what product would that form? If A is Na and B is Cl2, then C would be NaCl. But wait, NaCl is a white solid, not bright red. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the product C is bright red. What are bright red compounds? One that comes to mind is mercury(II) oxide, HgO, but that's red. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur or another element. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide? Wait, but some metal sulfides are bright. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitride. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that C is a compound of vanadium, which can have red colors. Or perhaps it's a transition metal chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a coordination compound.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the next reaction.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.

Hmm. If C is a metal chloride, and D is a gas like O2 or another diatomic gas. Wait, 2 equivalents of D. Let's say if C is a metal chloride and D is oxygen. Then perhaps C is something like FeCl2, which upon reaction with O2 could form FeO or Fe3O4. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal that forms a +3 ion, like aluminum. If B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles of Cl2, so 16 Cl atoms. So if A is Al (valency +3), each Al would need 3 Cl atoms. So 16 Cl atoms would correspond to 5 and 1/3 Al atoms, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps A is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal compound. For example, if A is sodium and B is Cl2, but that gives NaCl which is white. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal like copper. Wait, copper reacts with chlorine to form CuCl or CuCl2. For example, 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl (but that's more of a red color?), or 2 Cu + 3 Cl2 → 2 CuCl3? Wait, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is between a metal and sulfur vapor. Sulfur is a bright yellow solid, but when it reacts with metals like Fe, it forms FeS which is black. Wait, but maybe the product C is a sulfide of a transition metal which gives a bright red color. I'm not certain.

Alternatively,
