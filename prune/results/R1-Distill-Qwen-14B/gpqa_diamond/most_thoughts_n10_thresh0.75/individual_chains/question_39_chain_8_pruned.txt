Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle in a tube, moving along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions should be normalized. Oh right, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

But wait, there's another condition: when they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. I'm a bit confused here because the wave function should vanish outside the region, but this expression doesn't seem to do that. Oh wait, maybe that's only the part inside the region. Because the question says when they measured, they found particles only between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside, but within 1 to 3, it's given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i.

Wait, no, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the given expression is valid within that interval, and zero outside. But the way the question is phrased, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in a part where it can exist,
