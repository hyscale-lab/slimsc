Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that exists for a very short time before decaying, right? Like a short-lived particle.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance. Hmm. I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Because the particle can't travel far if it decays quickly.

The given parameters are:
- Production energy E_X = 8 GeV
- Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV
- Width Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, width... Oh right, in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, but I might have to dig deeper into that.

So, first, I need to find the lifetime τ of the meson X. Once I have τ, I can find the average distance it travels before decaying. But wait, how?

I recall that the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, actually, the natural linewidth is Γ, and Γ is the total decay rate. The uncertainty principle tells us that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty
