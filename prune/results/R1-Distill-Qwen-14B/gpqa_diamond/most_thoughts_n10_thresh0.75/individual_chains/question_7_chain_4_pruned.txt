Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path determines how far they can travel before interacting. If the mean free path is shorter than the universe's size, their number density reduces significantly. So, the lifetime is limited by this interaction when the gamma-ray's energy is such that the interaction cross-section multiplied by the photon density is enough to make the mean free path comparable to the universe's size.

Wait, the process is gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-. I think this is called photon-photon annihilation. The cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the photons involved. The cross-section formula for two photons producing an electron-positron pair must involve some kind of threshold condition.

Right, the threshold for pair production in photon-photon collisions is when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is at least twice the electron mass. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is around 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's the minimum energy in the CM frame. However, in our case, the CMB photon is low energy (1e-3 eV), and the gamma-ray is high energy.

So, let's think about the energies in the lab frame. Let me denote the high-energy gamma as photon 1 with energy E1, and the CMB photon as photon 2 with energy E2. Since E2 is much smaller than E1, we can approximate E2 as much lower. But wait, when considering photon-photon collisions, the actual energy in the CM frame matters.

The total energy in the CM frame must be sufficient to create the electron-positron pair. So, the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c). Since E1 is much larger than E2, but the momenta are in opposite directions (assuming head-on collision), the total momentum squared would be approximately (p1 - p2)^2 c^2.

Wait, but for the case where E2 is much smaller than E1, E1 ≈ |p1| c, and E2 ≈ |p2| c. So, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2, since the photons are moving in opposite directions.

Wait, no, because in the lab frame, if the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction to the gamma, then their momenta are opposite. So, the total four-momentum would be (E1 + E2, p1 c - p2 c) because their momenta are in opposite directions. But for the CMB, the photons are thermal, so they have a
