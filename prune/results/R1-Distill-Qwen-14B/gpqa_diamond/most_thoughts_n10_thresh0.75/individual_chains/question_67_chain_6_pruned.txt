Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l=1. So, both electrons have l1=1 and l2=1. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think represents the coupled angular momentum state. Wait, but wait a second—wait, can the total angular momentum quantum number l be 2 when each electron has l=1? Oh right, because the possible values for the sum of two l's are l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So for l1=1 and l2=1, l can be 2, 1, or 0. So 2 is allowed. Okay, that makes sense.

The problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum, so we're focusing just on the orbital parts. Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. Specifically, what's the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ?

Hmm. Wait, each Lz eigenvalue is m multiplied by ħ. So for an electron in a p orbital, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the eigenvalues for L1z and L2z are m1ħ and m2ħ, respectively.

So the question is, what's the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both give -ħ. That means m1 should be -1 and m2 should be -1 as well because their eigenvalues are mħ.

But wait, the state we're given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. So, the state is a combination of possible m1 and m2 values that add up to m=-1 for the total.

Wait, but wait, the state is the coupled state, not the product state. So the |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the individual m1 and m2 states that contribute to the total m=-1.

So, to find the joint probability of m1=-
