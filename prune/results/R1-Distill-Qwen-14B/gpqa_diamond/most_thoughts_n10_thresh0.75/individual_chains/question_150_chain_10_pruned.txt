Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. So the degree of unsaturation might give some clues. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) - that's a singlet or triplet? Oh wait, it's a triplet. High ppm, around 9.7, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde group.

Then 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons, perhaps in a substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift (around 7 ppm) suggests some substituents. Maybe para substituents? Because the doublets could indicate coupling with neighboring protons. So maybe two sets of doublets, each 2H, which could be a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H) â€” broad singlet. Broad usually indicates some exchange, like an -OH proton or maybe something else. But wait, in an aromatic region, a broad singlet for 2H? Maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some coupling. Or perhaps it's not aromatic? Wait, 6.27 is in the aromatic region, but sometimes vinyl protons can be around there too.

Then 3.66 ppm (d, 2H). That's a bit upfield for CH2 groups. Maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like a CH2O group. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring set of protons. So maybe a CH2 connected to something else, like an oxygen, perhaps in a ketone group or an aldehyde.

Putting this together. Maybe the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents, a chain with a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone), and some Oxygen in there.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, let's count the atoms. 8 carbons. If there's an aromatic ring, like benzene (6 carbons), then the remaining two carbons could be a substituent. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so that's 8 carbons: maybe two benzene rings? Or perhaps one benzene and another substituent.

Wait, looking at the options, some of
