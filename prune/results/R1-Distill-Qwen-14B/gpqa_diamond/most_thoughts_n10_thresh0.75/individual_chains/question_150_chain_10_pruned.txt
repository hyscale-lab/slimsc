Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then determining the product after a series of reactions. The options are all aldehydes with some substituents, so I need to track what's happening in each reaction step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, that doesn't immediately ring a bell, but maybe the NMR will help. The NMR data is given in ppm, so I need to interpret each peak.

The 1H-NMR data is:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. So the compound has an aldehyde group.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, maybe aromatic protons. Could be part of a phenyl ring with substituents.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Possibly another set of aromatic protons, maybe para to something.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2 protons. Could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol group or an enol.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

So putting it together, the molecule has an aldehyde (from 9.72), two aromatic rings (since 6.98 and 6.51 are probably each part of a ring), and some other substituents. The 3.66 ppm could be the CH2 from an aryl group connected via an oxygen, like an ether linkage. Wait, but the formula has one N and one O. Oh, wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So maybe there's a nitro group or an amine.

Wait, the reaction steps: first is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually a diazotization step, which is used for aromatic amines. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine, which gets converted into a diazonium salt.

But wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde. If the starting material has an aldehyde and an amine, that could be a problem because those groups are typically not both present in the same molecule unless something else is going on.

Wait, perhaps the NMR signals are from the starting material, and the reactions will transform it. Let me think. The starting material has an aldehyde group. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl â†’ probably forms a diazonium salt if there's an aromatic amine. But wait, after that, step 2 is H2O. Then step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. Hmm. Diazonium salt could undergo hydrolysis, maybe forming a phenol.

Wait, but the starting material doesn't have an amine. Let me check the NMR again. The triplet at 9.7
