Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. So the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, and they use the TTV method to discover them. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? But wait, maybe that's not directly relevant here. The key points are that they are in orbital resonance with periods in a specific ratio.

The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. Let's denote Planet_1's period as P, then the others are 2P, 2.5P, 3.5P, and 5P for Planet_2 through Planet_5 respectively.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They mention the same albedo, so I don't need to worry about that factor. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is the same for both, it's only about their distances.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Since the planets have different orbital periods, their distances from the star will vary. The distance relates to the period through Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for a given star. So P^2 is proportional to a^3. Therefore, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So if I find the ratio of a for Planet_4 and Planet_2, I can find their distances.

Planet_2's period is 2P, Planet_4's is 3.5P. So the ratio of their periods is 3.5P / 2P = 3.5/2 = 1.75. So the ratio of their distances is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, let's make sure. a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2
