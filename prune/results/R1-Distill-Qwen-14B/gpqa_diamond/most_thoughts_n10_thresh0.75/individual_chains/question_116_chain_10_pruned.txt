Okay, let's tackle this NMR problem. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. So, we have compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 

Alright, what do these signals indicate? Well, in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others. So, the 6H as a triplet suggests maybe a CH2CH3 group. Because if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, each proton on the CH2 would split the CH3 into a triplet. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, if a CH3 is next to a CH2, the CH3 protons would split into a quartet, and the CH2 would be a triplet. Wait, no, wait, let me think. No, the triplet in this case is for the 6H. So 6H as a tripletâ€”so each of these protons is neighboring two other sets. So maybe a (CH2CH3)2CH group? Or perhaps something like two CH2CH3 groups. 

Wait, another thought. If the triplet is for 6H, that's likely two equivalent CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3H, so 2 CH3 would be 6H. So each CH3 is a triplet. So what gives a triplet for a CH3? If each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group which is next to another CH2. Like, perhaps a structure where each CH3 is connected to a CH2, which is then connected to another CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they're in
