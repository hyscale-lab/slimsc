Alright, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates the Standard Model plus higher-dimensional operators. The question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry, and I need to choose which combination is correct. Let's think through each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think effective theories like SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, unless they're specifically breaking them. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators should too. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations and translations? Since Lorentz is part of Poincare, if SMEFT respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or wait, maybe SMEFT is built in a way that the operators are written in a Lorentz-invariant manner, which would imply Poincare as well. Or does the theory assume a flat spacetime, which is part of Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant, so they must respect Poincare as a whole. So option 2, Poincare, should also be respected.

Now, CP symmetry. CP is charge conjugation and parity. Wait, the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric, right? Like, certain processes violate CP. For example, in the electroweak sector, there's CP violation. So SMEFT includes the Standard Model's operators, which can violate CP. Therefore, the effective theory as a whole doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning that CP symmetry (option 3) is not necessarily respected by all operators. So option 3 is out.

CPT symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, all Lorentz-invariant theories respect CPT symmetry. Because the symmetries are connected. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So any operator in SMEFT that's Lorentz-invariant must also be CPT-invariant. So option 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected.

Putting it all together. The question is which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. So 1 (Lorentz) and 4 (CPT) are required. Wait, what about Poincare? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. If the theory is built in a way that the operators are local, then shouldn't they respect Poincare? Or is Poincare more a global symmetry, or part of the framework?

Wait, maybe I'm conflating the terms. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it's automatically invariant under translations because it's local. So all the operators are constructed to be translation-invariant, hence Poincare symmetry is respected. So for the options, both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but the question lists the options as 1,2,4. So that would be Lorentz, Poincare, and C
