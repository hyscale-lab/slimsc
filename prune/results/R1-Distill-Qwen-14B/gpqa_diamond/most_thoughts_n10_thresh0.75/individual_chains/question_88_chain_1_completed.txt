Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about immunology. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question says that rotavirus inner capsid proteins are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, others get entangled in intestinal mucus. But they managed to get to the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer patches. They isolated the proliferating cells and saw high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Wait, so what's happening here? I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are involved in mucosal immunity. They're where a lot of immune responses to intestinal pathogens start.

The GFP-tagged proteins probably act as antigens. When the mice are given these antigens via oral gavage, the stomach acid would break down some, but others might survive and reach the intestines. The ones that make it would then be processed by the immune system.

In the Peyer patches, antigen-presenting cells like M cells capture the antigens and present them to B cells. So the B cells would take up these rotavirus proteins. The variable heavy chain gene variability suggests that these B cells are diversifying their receptors, maybe through some process that increases diversity.

Looking at the options: 

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs during the generation of B and T cell receptors, especially in lymphoid tissues. It's a process that introduces mutations after VDJ recombination, leading to more diversity in the variable regions of the antibodies. This happens in germinal centers, which are sites of B cell proliferation and differentiation. So if the B cells are proliferating and their variable genes have high variability, this might be it.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, where complement proteins attack pathogens. But I don't think that's directly linked to the variable gene diversity in B cells.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It happens after the initial antigen recognition.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the initial process where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. It's during B cell development in the bone marrow. But if these are mature B cells in secondary lymphoid organs, VDJ wouldn't be happening. Plus, the question mentions the variable gene has high variability, suggesting ongoing diversification beyond the initial recombination.

Wait, but wait. VDJ recombination is during the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, producing a diverse initial set of B cells. Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated, usually in the germinal centers during the immune response. So when you have a secondary lymphoid organ like Peyer patches, the B cells there would be undergoing proliferation, and if they're in germinal centers, they'd be undergoing somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies, leading to a varied variable region.

The variable heavy chain gene sequencing shows high variability, which aligns with somatic hypermutation. So the process is A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. While some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus, others reach secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed. Sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins likely act as antigens, which are captured by antigen-presenting cells (e.g., M cells) and presented to B cells. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests ongoing diversification of B cell receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers, where activated B cells diversify their antibody repertoire by introducing mutations in the variable regions of their receptors. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes and the context of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions of the antibody.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B cell maturation in the bone marrow, generating the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It is not relevant to the mature B cells in secondary lymphoid organs undergoing further diversification.

Given the context of mature B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
