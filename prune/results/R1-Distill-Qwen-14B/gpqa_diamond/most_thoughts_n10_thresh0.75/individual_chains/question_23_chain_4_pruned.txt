Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through. So the question is about reacting a specific compound with hydrogen bromide, and then looking at the products using TLC. The reactant spot is diminishing, and two new spots have formed. The options are A to D, each giving possible product structures.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure in my mind. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is O connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- something? Wait, no. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I count from the first carbon attached to oxygen). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait no, but the numbering is from the point of attachment. So but-3-en-1-yl would be: the butenyl group is four carbons, with the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond can't be at the end. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, because the position of the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 if the substituent is on carbon 1. Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with double bond between 3 and 4? No, but that's beyond the chain. Maybe I should draw it as O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en
