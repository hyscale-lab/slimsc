Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. Let me try to think through this. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning they're spread out evenly. And the task is to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power law.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Now, the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think about the volume of space at a certain distance. Since space expands as you look further away, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the volume at a distance r is proportional to r squared when considering a thin shell of thickness dr. Because the volume of the shell (like an onion layer) is 4πr² dr.

But wait, parallax is 1/r. So if I let plx = p, then r = 1/p. So substituting, the volume shell becomes 4π( (1/p) )² * dr. Wait, no, because dr is in terms of r. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of p.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a given parallax range. Let's say we're considering a range from p to p + dp. What's the number of stars in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars dN in a volume element dV is dN = n * dV.

Now, the volume element dV between distances r and r + dr is 4π r² dr. But since p = 1/r, dr is ( -1 / p² ) dp. Wait, because p = 1/r, so r = 1/p, and dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases, but for the purposes of integration, we can take absolute values.

So substituting, dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, no. Let me see: dr =
