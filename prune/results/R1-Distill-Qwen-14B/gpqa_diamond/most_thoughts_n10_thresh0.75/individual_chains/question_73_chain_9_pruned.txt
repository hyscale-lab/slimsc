Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds directly because of the way velocities add in special relativity. Right, the formula for relative velocity isn't v1 - v2 over 1 - (v1*v2/c²) or something like that. Let me get the formula right.

Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at speed v relative to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so I think I just plug in their speeds into this formula.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is the speed of B? Or wait, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me clarify: the relative speed here is how fast B is moving according to A, or vice versa. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think it's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, wait—no, I think I have it backwards. If A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/c²) ? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no—because A is moving faster. Oh wait, no, let's think about it. Let me make it clear.

Let me denote A's speed as u = 0.6c, and B's speed as v = 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is the speed of B? Because B is moving slower than A, in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) ). Wait
