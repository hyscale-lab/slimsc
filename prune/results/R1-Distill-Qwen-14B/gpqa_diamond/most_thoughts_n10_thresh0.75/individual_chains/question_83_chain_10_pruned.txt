Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Alright, so first, I think I need to understand what's happening in the solution after dilution. Diluting the acetic acid with water will change its concentration because concentration decreases when you add more solvent. So the initial step is to calculate the new concentration after mixing.

Wait, right. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no wait. Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter. 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles of acetic acid initially is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then when we dilute to 40 cm³ (0.04 liters), the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

So now, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the first part is about the pH at 25% titration. The second part is at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, it could mean that 25% of the volume required to reach equivalence has been added. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, in titration terms, the percentage titration usually refers to the fraction of the analyte that has reacted. So 25% titration would mean that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

So, let's get into it.

First, calculate the equivalence point volume. Because at equivalence, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized by NaOH.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (from earlier). So
