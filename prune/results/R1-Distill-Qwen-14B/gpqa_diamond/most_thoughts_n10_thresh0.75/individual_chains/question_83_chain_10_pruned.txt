Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh, and the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. Since the volumes are additive, the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid remain the same because adding water doesn't change the amount, only the concentration.

Moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So that's 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, wait: 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right? So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, the diluted solution's volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate with NaOH. The NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% titration probably refers to 25% of the equivalence point. So I should find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point first.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Because each mole of acetic acid (a monoprotic acid) reacts with one mole of NaOH.

So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (as calculated earlier). So moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the first part is at 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Wait, but when doing a titration, the amount of NaOH added will determine how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So, for the 25% titration
