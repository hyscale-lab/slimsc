Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them, and the key here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines of the stars.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think I need is the one that connects the velocity semi-amplitude (K) with the orbital period (P).

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π)

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, so M_* >> M_p. That would mean M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and perhaps the formula simplifies.

In that case, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I might be thinking of another relation.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity. The maximum velocity (semi-amplitude) K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but if the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / (
