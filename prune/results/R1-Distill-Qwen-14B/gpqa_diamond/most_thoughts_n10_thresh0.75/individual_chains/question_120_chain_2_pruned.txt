Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Alright, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So that probably means that in space, their density is the same everywhere, right? But wait, when we observe them from Earth, how does that translate into the number of stars we see in different parallax ranges?

Parallax... I remember that parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (plx), so distance d = 1/plx. Oh right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. 

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how does the count change as parallax increases or decreases? Wait, higher parallax means closer stars, right? So for small plx values (like nearby stars), there are more stars in a given plx range? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think about this again.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, then their spatial density is constant. That means that the number of stars in a volume depends on the size of the volume. So in a region with a larger volume, there are more stars. But parallax relates to distance, so we're looking at how the number of stars in a certain range of plx (which relates to distance) behaves.

Let me model this. Let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. What's the corresponding distance range? Since d = 1/plx, maybe I should express everything in terms of distance. Let's see: if the parallax increases by dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance, dd?

Hmm. Let's compute it. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd/dplx = derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx. That's -1/(plx^2). So, dd = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. But since dplx is positive when plx increases (but wait, higher plx would mean closer stars, so maybe I should think about plx in a small range). Wait, perhaps I should flip it.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance. Let's say I pick a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd
