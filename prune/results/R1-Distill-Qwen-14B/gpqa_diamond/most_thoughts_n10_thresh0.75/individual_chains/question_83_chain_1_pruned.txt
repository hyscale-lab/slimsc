Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they should form acetate ions and water. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution affects the concentration. So first, I should find out the new concentration after dilution.

Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means we've added a quarter of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Alternatively, maybe it's 25% of the moles needed. Let me see.

First, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, 0.001 mol.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, so that's 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Wait, but sometimes percentage can be based on the initial solution's volume. So maybe I should check.

Alternatively, 25% of the required NaOH. So yes, 2.5 cm³. Let's proceed.

So for the 25% titration point:

We have added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. Moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. So remaining CH3COOH is 0.00075 mol. And moles of CH3COO^- produced are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³, or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Now, this is a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73 (wait, wait, more accurately: log(1.85e-5) is approx -4.73, so pKa is 4.73.)

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, that's close to 4.25. Looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and A is 4.26. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the concentrations. Oh wait, 0.00075 mol in 0.0425 L: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Correct. And 0.00025 / 0.0425 is 0.005882 M. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333, exactly 1/3. So log(1/3) is indeed about -0.477. So 4.73 - 0.477 is approx 4.253. So pH is around 4.25, which would round to 4.25. The options have A as 4.26 and D as 4.57.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me compute pKa more accurately.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no: pKa is -log10(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5))? No, wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So let me compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = 4.73 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5-0.267=4.733). So pKa≈4.73.

So the Henderson equation: pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈4.253.

So pH is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So probably A is the first part.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: maybe the initial dilution affects the calculation differently? Let me think again. The initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, diluted to 40 cm³. So correct, 0.025 M.

At 25% titration, which is 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles NaOH = 0.1 *0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So correct, 0.00025 mol reacted.

So buffer equation is correct, so pH is about 4.25.

Now, at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions. So what's the solution?

We have 0.001 mol of CH3COO^- in the solution. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ (since equivalence is at 10 cm³ NaOH), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, the solution will be basic. So we need to find the pH of a 0.02 M CH3COO^- solution.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10, which is very small, so the hydrolysis of acetate will produce a small amount of OH- ions.

The concentration of OH- can be found using the approximation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), so x ≈ sqrt(Kb * C). So x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02).

Compute that: 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11
