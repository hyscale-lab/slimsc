Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, so I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, usually gamma rays (photons). Since the problem states that the two photons have the same energy, that suggests their energies are equal. Also, since they are moving in opposite directions (both to the right, but in different quadrants), the angle between them can be found using some vector addition or maybe conservation laws.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Both photons have the same energy, but since energy and momentum are involved, maybe I should think about conservation of momentum and energy.

Let me think about the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other on the same line. So their momenta are opposite in direction. But since they have different Lorentz factors, their energies and momenta might not cancel each other out unless I calculate them.

Wait, what's a Lorentz factor? Oh right, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since they're giving me the Lorentz factors, I don't need to calculate v. The electron has gamma_e = 4, and the positron gamma_p = 2.

But wait, the electron and positron have the same mass (same magnitude), right? So the positron is like an electron but positive. So their rest mass is the same.

So the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are opposite in direction.

Let me denote the positive x-direction as to the right. So the electron is moving along +x, the positron is moving along -x.

So the initial momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, for the positron, it's gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since they're moving in opposite directions, the total initial momentum would be the sum: p_initial = gamma_e m_e v_e - gamma_p m_e v_p.

Wait, but wait, I don't know v_e and v_p. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), but maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of gamma. Because E = gamma m c², and momentum p = gamma m v.

Hmm. Alternatively, since I don't know the velocities, maybe I can express the momenta in terms of gamma and the rest mass. Let me think.

The momentum p for each particle is:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p

But wait, because the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_e (to the right) plus p_p (to the left), which would be p_e - p_p.

Wait, no, wait. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative x). So its momentum is gamma_p m_e v_p, but v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.

So the initial total momentum is p_e (right, positive) plus p_p (left, negative) which is p_e - p_p (since p_p is negative).

Wait, maybe I can express this in terms of gamma. Because p = gamma m v. Hmm, but that still leaves me with the velocities unknowns.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of their velocities since we know their gamma factors.

Let me think. The Lorentz factor gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4, so 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_e²/c²)).

Squaring both sides: 16 = 1/(1 - v_e²/c²) → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/16 → v_e² = c² (1 - 1/16) → v_e² = (15/16) c² → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) → v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c. That's a high speed.

Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2. So gamma_p=2 → 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_p²/c²)) → 4 = 1/(1 - v_p²/c²) →1 - v_p²/c² = 1/4 → v_p² = (3/4) c² → v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c.

So the velocities are v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c (to the right), and v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c (to the left, since the positron is moving from the right).

Wait, but wait, in the setup, the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So from where? Like, the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the right (from right)? No, wait, no. If the positron is moving from the right, that means it's moving towards the left. Because if it's moving along the same horizontal axis, from the right, it's moving to the left. So its velocity is negative.

So the electron's velocity v_e is positive (right), and the positron's velocity v_p is negative (left), so when calculating momentum, the positron's momentum is negative.

So initial total momentum:

p_initial = gamma_e m v_e - gamma_p m v_p (because v_p is negative).

Wait, wait, let me think again. The positron is moving from the right, so in our coordinate system, it's moving along negative x. So its velocity is -v_p (if v_p is the speed). Wait, no, maybe I should assign v_p as the magnitude. Then, the positron's velocity is -v_p, since it
