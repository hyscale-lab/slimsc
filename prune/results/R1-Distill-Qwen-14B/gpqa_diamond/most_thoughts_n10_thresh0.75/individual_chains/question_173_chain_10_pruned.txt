Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Let me think. Oh right, the principle says that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more you know about one, the less you know about the other.

The problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction at speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nanometers is pretty small, which makes sense for electrons since they're so tiny.

I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh wait, energy uncertainty relates to the uncertainty in momentum, right? Because energy is related to momentum via kinetic energy equations. So first, I should find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, the question mentions the minimum uncertainty, so I guess I should use the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2. That gives me the smallest possible Δp for the given Δx.

So let me jot down the numbers. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes people use 1e-34 for quick calculations. Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So Δp = ħ/(
