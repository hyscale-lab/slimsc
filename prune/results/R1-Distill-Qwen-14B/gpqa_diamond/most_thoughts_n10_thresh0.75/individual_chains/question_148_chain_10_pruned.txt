Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. Let's see, it's about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. Hmm, I'll start by breaking down the information given.

The problem states there are five binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. That rings a bell. Fluorine typically forms a lot of compounds, but which elements have multiple binary fluorides? I remember that elements like oxygen have several, but oxygen's more about oxides. Wait, maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, halogens can form various compounds. Or perhaps a group 1 or 2 element? Hmm.

Looking at the first part: substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so oxidizing it would mean something is acting as an oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 is a fluorine compound acting similarly.

Wait, decomposition of A1 produces fluorine and A2. So if A1 is a compound of Y and F, when it decomposes, it gives Y's compound (A2) and F2. So maybe A1 is something like YF3 or YF4.

Wait, but let's think about a bright red substance. What fluorides are red? I think Y might be iodine because some of its fluorides are red. For example, iodine trifluoride (IF3) is a reddish-brown gas, but maybe another compound? Or perhaps it's ClF3, but I'm not sure about its color. Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? Or perhaps another element.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Fluorine is a common oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is a compound that releases F2 when it decomposes. For example, if A1 is YF2, but that might not decompose into F2 and Y. Hmm, perhaps A1 is something like YF5, which upon decomposition gives YF3 and F2. Or maybe it's a higher fluoride.

Wait, another approach: when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 with oF=31.96%. Wait, oF probably stands for the degree of fluorination or the percentage of fluorine by mass. So, if A2's fluorine is 31.96%, what could that be?

Let me calculate. Let's assume A2 is YF_x. The formula mass of A2 would be Y's atomic mass plus x*(19) (since F is ~19 g/mol). The percentage of F is 31.96%, which is about 32%. So F contributes 32% of the mass.

Hmm, 32% of the molecular weight is from F. Let's say A2 is YF3. Then, the molecular weight would be Y + 3*19 = Y + 57. The percentage F is (57)/(Y+57) *100 =32%.

So 57/(Y+57) = 0.32 → 57 = 0.32(Y +57) → 57 /0.32 = Y +57 → approx 178.125 = Y +57 → Y is about 121.125 g/mol. Wait, but Y is an element, so looking at the periodic table, the atomic weight around 121 is... Iodine is around 127, so maybe close. Alternatively, maybe it's YF4?

Wait, let me check. If A2 is YF4, the molecular weight is Y + 4*19 = Y+76. The F% is (76)/(Y+76) )= 0.32 → 76 =0.32(Y+76) → 76 /0.32 = Y +76 → 237.5 = Y +76 → Y=161.5. Hmm, that's higher than I thought. Are there elements around 161? Let's see, the atomic weight of polonium is about 200, but that's too high. Maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A2 is YF2. Then the weight is Y +38. F% is (38)/(Y+38) =0.32 → 38 =0.32(Y+38) → 38 /0.32 = Y +38 → 118.75 = Y +38 → Y=80.75. That's around 80, which is close to strontium (Sr, about 87.62), but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: maybe A2 is YF3. So Y is 127 (iodine). So YF3 would have a molecular weight of 127 +3*19=127+57=184. The F% is 57/184 *100 ≈31%. That's very close to 31.96%. Oh! So 57/184 is 0.310, but the problem says 31.96%, which is almost 32%. Hmm, maybe Y is another element, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, if Y has a molecular weight of approximately 127, which is iodine, then YF3 would have that F percentage. Alternatively, let's compute 57/(Y +57) = 0.3196. So:
