Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Okay, the setup: the researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G. They introduced an HA tag (hemagglutinin) at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence provided, I need to figure out why the protein isn't being expressed properly.

First, I'll check for the presence of the HA tag. The HA tag is a small peptide (usually 11 amino acids) derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. It's added to proteins for detection and purification. If the HA tag isn't correctly inserted, the protein might not be detected, but the question is about overexpression, so perhaps the tag isn't the issue here.

Wait, but the problem says the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence starts with the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G sequence. Let me look at the given DNA sequence.

Looking at the very beginning: 5'ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC is tyrosine, but wait, the HA tag is supposed to be inserted. Hmm, maybe the HA tag is inserted before the ATG? Or perhaps the ATG is part of the HA sequence.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is something like ATG GTA TCA TCA GAA TAC A... or similar, but I'm not exactly sure. The main point is that the HA tag is added to the N-terminus, so the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But looking at the start of the provided sequence, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the start codon is ATG, then TAC is tyrosine. That would imply that the HA tag isn't present, but wait, the question says the HA tag was added. So perhaps the HA tag sequence is missing, or maybe the cloning inserted it incorrectly.

Wait, no, the researcher modified the gene to add the HA tag. So the construct should include the HA coding sequence before the start of GADD45G. Let me think about how that would look in the DNA.

The HA tag is encoded by a specific sequence. Let's say the HA tag is inserted right before the start codon of GADD45G. So the HA sequence would be followed by ATG, then the GADD45G sequence.

But in the given DNA, the first codon after the initial ATG is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GCT (alanine), etc. So that's the GADD45G coding sequence. Wait, but then where is the HA tag?

Hmm, perhaps the HA tag was inserted incorrectly, or perhaps it's within the GADD45G coding sequence. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was added in a way that disrupts the reading frame.

Wait, but the problem states that the HA sequence was introduced at the N-terminus. So the plus strand starts with the HA coding sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the provided sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GCT (A), etc. So that's the GADD45G amino acids. But where is the HA?

Wait, maybe the HA tag is in the first few codons. Let me think: the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA (I think that's right), which is about 10 amino acids. So the DNA sequence would be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT etc. Wait, the first few codons in the provided sequence are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GCT, etc. Let's translate that into amino acids.

ATG is methionine (start), then TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid, GCT is alanine, TCC is serine, AGA is arginine
