Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about the uncertainty principle. I remember that from my quantum mechanics class. The question is about an electron moving at a certain speed and the uncertainty in its energy.

Wait, the problem states that the electron is traveling along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are in the order of 10^-16 to 10^-18 J, so I guess the answer is somewhere in that range.

First, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. But since we want the minimum uncertainty, I think I'll use the equality Δx * Δp = h/(4π).

Wait, but how does that relate to energy uncertainty? Oh right, because energy is related to momentum. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in momentum Δp.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, find Δp. Using Δx * Δp = h/(4π). So Δp = h/(4πΔx).

I know Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes it's given as h-bar (ħ) which is h/(2π). So maybe I should double-check. The formula could also be written with ħ, so let me think. Oh right, the uncertainty principle is often expressed as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So maybe I should use ħ = h/(2π). So perhaps the correct formula for the minimum Δp is Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimal uncertainty would be when Δp = ħ/(2Δx). So that's correct.

So substituting the values, Δp = (h/(2π)) / (2Δx) )? Wait, no. Wait, ħ is h/(2π
