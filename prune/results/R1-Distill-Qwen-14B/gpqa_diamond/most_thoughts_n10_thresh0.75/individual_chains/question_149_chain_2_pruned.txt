Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right, except there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected. So, they're integrating as one proton in total, just split into two peaks. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests they have the same molecular weight, so same mass. But why two peaks? It's not a contamination because the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. So, the two peaks must be the same compound but perhaps in different forms.

What could cause two peaks in LC-MS? Maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Let me think about that.

In NMR, when you have a proton that's split into two peaks, it's usually because of some coupling. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's something else, like different environments causing the same proton to split.

Wait, in the case of diastereomers, each would have their own NMR spectrum. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, each would contribute their own peaks. But the integral adds up to 1H because it's the same proton in each isomer.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So maybe the alpha-proton is in a different environment in each of the diastereomers. So each would have their own peak. The two peaks would have similar shifts because the environments are similar, just slightly different.

In LC-MS, if there are diastereomers, they would have different retention times, hence two peaks. And if they have the same mass (since diastereomers have same molecular weight), the mass spec would match. So that's possible.

Alternatively, could it be enantiomers? They would also have the same mass. But in NMR, for an enantiomer, if the sample is not chiral and the compound is achiral, but wait, if the compound is chiral, a racemic mixture would have identical NMR peaks. So if the sample is a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton because the environment is symmetric. Unless the coupling is causing some splitting, but the question says coupling is ruled out.

Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would contribute the same peak in NMR because the alpha protons are in equivalent environments. So the NMR would show a singlet, not two peaks. So maybe enantiomers aren't the cause here.

Another possibility is that the compound has some double coupling during synthesis, like in the amide bond formation. So, 'double coupling'â€”what does that mean? Oh, wait, in some reactions, especially in peptide synthesis, sometimes you can form more than one bond, leading
