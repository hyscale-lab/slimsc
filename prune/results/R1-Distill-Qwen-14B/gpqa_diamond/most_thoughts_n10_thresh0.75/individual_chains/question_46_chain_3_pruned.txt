Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. So metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right?

First, I need to figure out the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But wait, 3-methyl would add a methyl branch. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let's count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene: The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Or wait, wait: Wait, no. Let me number the carbons correctly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is the third carbon from the start. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no, wait, that's five carbons? Let me count: 1 (CH₂), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, that would give the structure as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene: Carbon 1 is CH₂, carbon 2 is CH, then carbon 3 is CH with a methyl group. So:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH3

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, no, because that would be six carbons. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Oh, wait, wait. Pentene is five carbons, so the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, that's four carbons after the double bond. No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The parent chain has five carbons. The double bond starts at carbon 1, so positions 1 and 2. The methyl group is on carbon 3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C3 has a methyl branch. So the overall structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me count
