Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how long it takes for these aliens to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud using their super fast spacecraft. Hmm, the problem gives a lot of data, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, I know that the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think the distance to it is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years from Earth. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I remember reading that it's roughly around 170,000 light-years away. So I'll go with that as an approximate distance.

The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to the speed of light. I remember that when you're going that fast, relativistic effects become significant. So time dilation must come into play here. Time dilation is where time moves slower for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth). 

The astronaut is 22 years old, and I guess we're to find out their age when they reach Earth, but from their own perspective. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less than the time it takes from Earth's frame of reference because of their high speed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. From the astronaut's perspective, they are stationary, and Earth is moving towards them at almost the speed of light. Or is it the other way around? No, the astronaut is moving towards Earth, so Earth is moving towards them at that speed. Hmm, but regardless, the time experienced by the astronaut would be less due to time dilation.

Let me try to calculate the time it takes from Earth's frame first. The distance is about 170,000 light-years, and speed is 0.99999987c. So time = distance/speed. Let me compute that.

Time in Earth's frame = 170,000 light-years / 0.99999987c.

Wait, since speed is a fraction of c, time in years would be 170,000 / 0.99999987 â‰ˆ approximately 170,000 / 1, which is about 170,000 years. Wait,
