Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can do.

The problem starts by giving the molecular formula of a compound: C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have half a degree. Did I do the formula correctly? Oh wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. The formula is C8H9NO. So, X is 0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2=10/2=5. Oh right, I forgot the +1 for N. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense. Five could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds and a ring, so 4 degrees) plus a carbonyl (another double bond), so that's 5. So the compound probably has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

The NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H-NMR has the following signals:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so it's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group.

Then, looking at the aromatic region. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each pair as a doublet, probably para-substituted? Like in a para-disubstituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split each other into doublets. Wait, but each is a doublet, so maybe they're part of a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Or perhaps two identical substituents in para positions.

Wait, but wait. Looking at the aromatic region, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). The downfield shift (6.98) could be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like NO2, or maybe an oxygen substituent. But wait, the molecular formula includes an O, so perhaps it's an -OH group or an ether. But wait, in the NMR, there's a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. That's in the aromatic region again, but a broad singlet. Broad signals often come from exchange with protons, like -OH groups. But wait, in the aromatic region, a broad singlet of 2H suggests something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton? But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 9.72 is likely an aldehyde. Then, perhaps the molecule has a benzaldehyde group. The 3.66 ppm doublet integrating for 2H suggests maybe a methylene group (CH2) next to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or maybe a CH2 connected to something else. Since the peak is a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to another CH2, or maybe a neighboring group that causes splitting.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see... If the molecule has a benzene ring (C6H5), and then the rest is C2H4NO. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's see: Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. So the given compound has C8H9NO, which is one more carbon, three more hydrogens, and an N. So perhaps the benzaldehyde part is C7H5NO, and the rest is something else.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an amino group. Alternatively, perhaps an amino group is part of a side chain attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the aldehyde proton is at 9.72 ppm. Let me think, maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. The substituents could include another phenyl group or something else.

Looking at the NMR again: The aromatic signals. The 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say, for example, two substituents on the benzene ring, each in the para position. Each substituent has a hydrogen that's a doublet. Wait, but in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are equivalent, so they would all be the same and give a singlet. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the meta position, but that doesn't fit with the doublets. Alternatively, perhaps these are from another benzene ring, like a diphenyl structure. Or maybe it's a substituted benzene attached to another group.

Wait, another approach. The aldehyde proton is a triplet. That would mean it's coupled with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is part of a propenal group or something like that. Wait, maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a conjugated system.

Let me think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Hmm, that sequence. The first reagent, NaNO2 and HCl, is typically used for diazotization. So this is a Sandmeyer reaction setup. But wait, the second step is water. That could be a hydrolysis. Wait, if the compound has a nitro group, but in the formula, O is present but N is in the formula as part of the compound. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so N is as part of an amine or amide or nitro group.

Wait, but diazotization usually occurs with aromatic amines. So perhaps the starting compound is an aromatic amine. But wait, the reaction sequence after diazotization is water and then aqueous KOH with heat. That might be a hydrolysis of a diazonium salt. Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is a primary aromatic amine, which upon treatment with HNO2 forms a diazonium chloride, which then is hydrolyzed.

Wait, but the initial compound has an aldehyde group. Hmm, if the starting compound has an aldehyde and an aromatic amine, that might be possible. Let me see.

Wait, but the initial NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Let me think of the structure. Suppose the molecule is something like p-hydroxybenzaldehyde with another substituent. Or perhaps it's a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cinnamaldehyde or similar.

Wait
