Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The question is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. So, the nucleus splits into two fragments. The initial nucleus has a rest mass of M, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, rest mass energy is given by E=mc², so M would be 300 GeV/c².

When it fissions, it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, let me denote the mass of the smaller fragment as m, then the larger one would be 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, m + 2m = 0.99 M. That means 3m = 0.99 M, so m = (0.99/3) M. Therefore, the smaller fragment is 0.33 M, and the larger is 0.66 M. Wait, no, because 0.33 is m, so 2m is 0.66. Hmm, but wait, 0.33 + 0.66 = 0.99, which matches.

Wait, but the initial nucleus has a rest mass of M, so the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99 M. So, some mass must have been converted into kinetic energy or other forms. Because in any nuclear reaction, the mass can be converted into energy, so that's where the kinetic energy comes from.

The problem asks about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So, the first thing I think is that in the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and energy in a straightforward way. But in reality, because the energies involved are high (300 GeV is way beyond non-relativistic speeds), relativistic effects must be considered. So, the correct approach would involve relativistic mechanics, and we have to compare both results.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Determine the masses of the two fragments.
2. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find their kinetic energies, considering the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy after fission.
3. Calculate T1 relativistically and classically, then find the difference.

Wait, but the system is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities of the two fragments as v1 and v2. Since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So, gamma1 * m1 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * v2, but since the directions are opposite, perhaps v2 is negative. Alternatively, let me write it as p1 = -p2.

Wait, but p1 and p2 are vectors, so if the nucleus splits into two
