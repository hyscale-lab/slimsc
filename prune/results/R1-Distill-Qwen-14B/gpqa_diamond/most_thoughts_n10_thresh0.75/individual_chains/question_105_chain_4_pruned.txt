Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness over time, similar to how an exoplanet would. The goal is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Alright, so the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's jot that down: R_star = R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000 K. So the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, no, wait. Since the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, right? Because spots are dark, so they must be cooler. So the spot temperature is 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K. Got it.

Now, the problem says that the brightness variations due to these spots are similar to those caused by an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of the exoplanet (R_pl) relative to the star's radius (R_star) such that the light curve amplitude is the same.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to (R_pl / R_star)^2. So the relative flux change is (R_pl^2)/(R_star^2). But wait, this is for a planet blocking the light. But in this case, the spots are causing a variation as the star rotates, so the brightness changes as the spots come into view and then go away.

So first, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the dip caused by a planet transit.

Let me think about the spot scenario. The star is emitting light, and the spots are cooler, so when they are in our view, the total brightness is a bit less. Since only one hemisphere is covered, and the spots are rotating into and out of view, the brightness variation will be periodic as the spots come into view.

The filling factor is 20%, meaning that 20% of the visible hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered by spots. So if the star is a sphere, the total surface area is 4πR^2. The spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 4πR^2 = 0.8πR^2. But since only one hemisphere is spotty, wait, does that affect the filling factor? Hmm, perhaps not. The filling factor is the total area of the spots divided by the total area of the star. So it's 20% regardless of which hemisphere.

But when the star rotates, say, the spots are on the western hemisphere, so when it's facing us, we see that part. Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as it spins. So the brightness variation would be due to the spots moving in and out of the observed hemisphere.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the spots being on one side of the star. So when the star rotates and that side comes into view, we see the spots. The spot coverage is 20% of the entire star's surface. So when the star rotates, the spots are either visible or not, leading to a change in brightness.

But wait, no. Because the star is spherical, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view when the other hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum brightness would be when the cooler spots are on the far side (so we see the hotter regions), and the minimum when the spots are on the near side.

Wait, no. Because the spots are cooler. When the cooler spots are in our view, the total light we receive is less. So when the star rotates so that the spots are on the far side, we see the entire star's hotter surface, so maximum brightness. When the spots come into view, brightness decreases.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between the maximum brightness (when no spots are in view) and the minimum (when spots are in view).

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is rotating, only a part of the spotty hemisphere is visible. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view as the star spins. So the maximum brightness occurs when the spots are not visible, and the minimum when they are fully visible.

Wait, but the spot coverage is 20% of the entire star's surface. So when the star is viewed such that the spotty
