Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down. 

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. Half of one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The astronomers are observing this star, and because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. This is similar to the light curve changes we see when a planet transits in front of a star. So the question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet (Rpl) relative to the star's radius (Rstar) needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's brightness variations as these spots do?

Hmm, right. So the problem is comparing two scenarios: one where a planet transits the star, causing a dip in brightness, and another where star spots cause a similar dip as they rotate. We need to find Rpl/Rstar that gives the same signal.

First, I think I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet radius would cause the same change.

Let me think about the basics. The brightness change (or the change in flux) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF/F = (Rp / Rstar)^2

Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star. So that's the transit depth, which is the dip in brightness.

But in this case, the star's brightness is varying because of the spots. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots would depend on the area covered by spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, the star emits light based on its surface area and temperature. The total flux from the star is F = σTeff^4 * (4πRstar^2)/(4πD^2) ), but when a spot is observed, it's a cooler area, so the flux from that region is less.

So the variation in brightness when the star rotates and the spots come into view is a bit more complicated. The change in flux (ΔF) is the difference between the flux when the spot is facing us and when it's not. 

But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. But since only one hemisphere is covered, the spots would only be visible when that part of the star is in our line of sight. So the maximum effect would be when the spots are fully visible, and the minimum when they're not.

Alternatively, maybe the variation is the difference between the flux when the spots are on the side facing us and when they're not. Or wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the change in the total flux received when the spots are in view compared to when they're not.

The problem says the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, I think, is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So if the hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, then 20% of that hemisphere is spots.

Wait, the star's hemisphere is covered. So the entire hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots on the entire star would be 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1, or 10% of the total star's surface area.

Wait, no, wait. Because the filling factor is defined as the fraction of the surface covered by spots. But here, the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the total area of spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) = 0.2 * (2π R²) ) = 0.4 π R². The total surface area of the star is 4 π R². So the fraction of the star's surface covered is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1, or 10%.

So the area covered by spots is 10% of the star's surface.

Now, each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K. The rest of the star is at 6000 K.

So the flux from the star when the spots are on the side facing us would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4 π Rstar^2) ) / (4 π D^2) ), but when spots are present, the flux is lower because some areas are cooler.

But the variation in flux would be when the spots rotate into and out of view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when it's not.

Wait, but the problem says that the photometric observations show periodic variations due to the spots. So the maximum dip in brightness would occur when the maximum number of spots is visible. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when that hemisphere is facing us, all the spots are visible, and when it's not, the spots are on the far side and don't affect our observations.

So the brightness variation would peak when the spotted hemisphere is directly facing us.

So the change in flux would be the difference between the flux when the spots are facing us and when they're not. 

The total flux when spots are visible: F_spotted = (flux from unspotted regions) + (flux from spotted regions).

Flux per unit area is sigma T^4. So the flux from the unspotted regions is F_unspotted = (1 - 0.1) * sigma * (6000)^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) / (4 pi D^2) ) / (4 pi Rstar^2) )? Wait, maybe I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the star's flux as the sum of flux from all areas. When the spots are on the near side, their flux is lower.

The total flux without any spots: F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2) ) / (4 pi D^2) ) = sigma T_eff^4 Rstar^2 / D^2.

When the spots are facing us, the flux is F_spotted = F0 - (area of spots) * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4) / (something)?

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

Each small area dA on the star's surface emits flux sigma T^4 dA (perpendicular to observer). So the total flux is the integral over the entire surface of sigma T^4 dA cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the surface normal and the observer's
