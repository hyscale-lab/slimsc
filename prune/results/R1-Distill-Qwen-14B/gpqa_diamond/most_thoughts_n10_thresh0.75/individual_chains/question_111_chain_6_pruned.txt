Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two parts, A and B, and there are four options given. I need to figure out the major products for each reaction and match them with the options.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) gives product A.

The second reaction: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) gives product B.

I'll tackle them one at a time.

Starting with Reaction A: It looks like a cyclohexanone derivative reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of a strong base, t-BuOK. I'm remembering that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate, it's likely a type of addition reaction. Maybe a conjugate addition or a Michael addition?

Wait, no, wait. Ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So when a ketone reacts with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, it's probably undergoing a conjugate addition. But wait, another possibility is a Claisen-like addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, t-BuOK is a strong base. So maybe it's a base-catalyzed reaction. One common reaction is the enolate formation. The ketone could form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate.

Wait, but ethyl acrylate is the acrylate. So maybe the cyclohexanone forms an enolate, which attacks the acrylate. Alternatively, the acrylate could act as the electrophilic part for a nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But I don't think so because the dienophile would be the acrylate, but the cyclohexanone might not be a diene. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is a Michael addition, where the enolate acts as a nucleophile attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate of the cyclohexanone would attack the acrylate.

Wait, but wait
