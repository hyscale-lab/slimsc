Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue one? I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, right? Because I remember that Co(SCN)2^2+ is blue. So the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^(n) in the solution.

Stability constants, okay. So β represents the formation constant for each complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So for each complex, the β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

So the complexes would be: Co^2+, Co(SCN), Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4.

Wait, but the β values given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 corresponds to the first complex, which is CoSCN^+, I think. So the complexes are:

1. Co^2+ (β1 is the formation constant for adding one SCN-)
2. Co(SCN)^+ (β1=9)
3. Co(SCN)_2^(2+) (β2=40)
4. Co(SCN)_3^(3+) (β3=63)
5. Co(SCN)_4^(4+) (β4=16)

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. Stability constants are for each step. So the overall formation constant for the second complex is β1 multiplied by β2, but wait, no. Wait, each β is for the nth complex. So the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, and its β1 is 9. The second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), and its β2 is 40, which would be the equilibrium constant for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), so the overall constant would be β1 * β2?

Or maybe the βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. Let me clarify: Beta for the first complex is 9, meaning [CoSCN]^+ has a formation constant of 9. The second complex's beta is 40, so the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is 40. But wait, that can't be right because then the overall for the second complex would be β1 * β2. Or perhaps each β is the stepwise constant. So stepwise, each β is for adding another SCN-.

Wait, no, more accurately, the stability constant for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise β's up to n. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is β1 * β2 * ... * βn, right?

Wait, no, the stability constant for each step is the stepwise addition. So the formation of [CoSCN]^+ is β1 =9. Then, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) would be β2=40 for the next addition. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40= 360. Similarly, β3 is 63, so the overall β for [Co(SCN)_3] is 9*40*63= 22680. And β4 is 16, so the overall β for [Co(SC
