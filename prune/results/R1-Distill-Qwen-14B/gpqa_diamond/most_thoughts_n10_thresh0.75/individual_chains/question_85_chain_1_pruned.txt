Okay, so I've got this question about planets around a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the question gives a lot of data. Let me parse it. There's a star with mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and Teff 6300 K. Two planets, Planet1 and Planet2. Their masses are 7 and 5 Earth masses, respectively. Radii are 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The key part is about the Doppler shifts. Planet1's shift is up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's is 0.04 Å. But wait, I think the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravity. So the radial velocity method measures this shift to find the planet's mass. 

But how does this tie into equilibrium temperature? Oh, right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Since the albedos are the same for both planets, that term cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but to find the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2, I need their distances from the star. Do I have those? Hmm, the question doesn't directly give the distances, but perhaps I can find it using the Doppler shift data.

The Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity. The RV method equation is something like K = (v*sin i) = ( (G M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(−1/3) ), but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ), but since e is zero (they're circular), and sin i is 1 (edge-on, because transit method is used; transit implies sin i ≈1), so K is proportional to M_planet / M_star^(2/3).

Wait, the star's mass is 1
