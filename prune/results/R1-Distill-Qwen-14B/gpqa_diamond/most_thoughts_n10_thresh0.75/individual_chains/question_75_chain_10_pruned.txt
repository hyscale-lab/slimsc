Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong with the experiment. Let's see, the setup is about creating a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G protein for studying its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The researcher introduced an influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to find why the protein isn't being expressed correctly. Let's start by analyzing the sequence.

The plus strand sequence starts with 5' ATG... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. That's good. Then it continues with TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, no, wait: the reading frame is important. Let's think step by step.

The sequence is the coding strand, so when transcribed, the mRNA would be complementary to this. But wait, DNA is double-stranded, and the coding strand is the same as mRNA except Tâ†’U. So the mRNA would read 5' ATG TAC ... etc.

Wait, let's break down the first few codons. ATG is the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, next is CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine again), then GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAA (glutamic acid), etc.

Wait, but the construct includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. How is that done? The HA tag is usually a short peptide, around 11 amino acids. Its DNA sequence would be inserted after the start codon. Let me recall the HA sequence. The HA tag is often derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. The common HA tag is: YPYDVPDYA. Let me get the DNA sequence for that.

Each amino acid is encoded by three nucleotides. Let's go through Y, P, Y, D, V, P, D, Y, A.

Y is
