Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let's see. The question involves six substances reacting with excess bromine, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are given, and I need to figure out the correct order.

First, I remember that electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings leads to products where the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

So each of the compounds 1-6 has a different substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them out again:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl group
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → ethyl ester (COOEt)
3) C6H5-Cl → chloride
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitro group
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group
6) C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid

Wait, I should think about each substituent's directing effects.

Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. It's ortho/para directing. So when bromine substitutes, it will form more ortho and para products.

Ethyl ester (COOEt): The ester group is a deactivating group because the oxygen in the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Esters are meta directors. So substitution will occur more at the meta positions.

Chloride (Cl): Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating because it's a halogen. So the ring is less reactive, but the incoming electrophile (Br+) will add to ortho, para, or meta positions. Wait, no, Cl is a meta director? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the halogens are ortho/para directors but deactivating. So they direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions, but since they deactivate the ring, the reaction might be slower compared to activating groups.

Nitro group (NO2): Strongly deactivating and meta directing. So the substituent will go meta to the nitro group.

Ethyl group (C2H5): Similar to methyl, it's an activating group, ortho/para directing. So substitution will happen more in ortho and para.

Carboxylic acid (COOH): This is a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH group. It's a meta director as well. So substitution occurs meta to the COOH group.

Wait, but what about the effect of substituents on the substitution pattern? The question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So I need to figure out for each substituent, how much para product is formed.

Wait, but wait, some substituents are meta directors, so para product might not be a major product. Let me think about each case.

1) Methyl group: Ortho/para director. So the major products are ortho and para. But since it's a activating group, the reaction is more likely to occur.
