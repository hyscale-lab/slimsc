Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I remember that the decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity.

Wait, right, the mean decay length is usually given by the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (βc), where β is the velocity in terms of the speed of light. So, the formula should be something like L = τ * βc.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, τ is the mean lifetime, which relates to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ = ħ/(Γ), but wait, I think I might have that backwards. Oh wait, no, the natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, isn't Γ the total decay width, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. That makes sense because a larger width means a shorter lifetime.

Wait, but wait. Units are important here. Let me make sure I handle the units correctly. Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. ħ (h-bar) has units of GeV·s, right? Because ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.
