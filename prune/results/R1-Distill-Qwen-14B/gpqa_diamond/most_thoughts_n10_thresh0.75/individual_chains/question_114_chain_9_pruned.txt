Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem states two reactions and asks which reagents (A and B) are suitable. The options are A, B, C, D with different combinations.

First reaction: Butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with HCN or its derivatives, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh right, the reaction of ketones with cyanide usually involves the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product here is a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN, but in this case, NaCN is used. So I think the reaction is proceeding under acidic conditions because HCN is a weak acid and needs acid to protonate the carbonyl. So for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid. Looking at the options, H3O+ is in options A and B for reagent A.

So if A is H3O+, then that should work. The reaction would be the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, and the acid would help protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the nitrile group is getting converted into a carboxylic acid. So how does that happen?

I know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions, possibly with heat. For example, under acidic conditions, H2SO4 and H2O with heat, or under basic conditions like NaOH and H2O, heating.

Wait, but the problem says reagent B is H2O. So perhaps B is a catalyst or an acid/base. So in the second reaction, the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

In the first step, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. But wait, the structure given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a tertiary alcohol next to the nitrile.

In the second reaction, we're taking a nitrile (butanenitrile derivative) and turning it into a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

How does that happen? I think that usually, nitriles are hydrolyzed to amides first under certain conditions, and then further to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, in strong acidic or basic conditions with water, the nitrile can be converted directly.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the starting material is a 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Oh wait, no, the second reaction's starting material is 2-(4-b
