Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions continue normally. We need to find the ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band1) and 800-900 keV (band2). So, flux1/flux2.

Hmm, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy, and it has different branches. The pp-III branch must be one part of that chain. Wait, the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, right? And it has several steps. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and pp-II and pp-III are alternative branches that produce different isotopes but contribute less.

Oh right, the pp-III branch produces boron-8, which then decays into beryllium-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from pp-III are the ones that are the primary component of the solar neutrinos detected on Earth, I think.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that should affect the production of these neutrinos. But wait, the question says it stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since light takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun, the neutrinos would be unaffected because they move at nearly the speed of
