Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the area of a pseudosphere using the given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in general relativity, often associated with anti-de Sitter space or something like that. But wait, the metric given here looks a bit different. Let me parse the problem again.

The metric is given as ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, the line element is scaled by this factor 32/(4 - x² - y²). I think this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's describing some kind of surface.

The question is about finding the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, but in the metric, I don't see an 'r' variable. Oh, maybe 'r' here refers to some radial coordinate in a polar coordinate system, but the metric is written in terms of x and y. So perhaps I should consider switching to polar coordinates for easier calculation of the area.

Let me think: in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². But wait, the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So substituting x² + y² = r², the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that might make things easier.

Now, to find the area, I think I should compute the area in this space. In general, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. But wait, wait. Wait, in the metric, the coefficients depend on r. So the area element would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ, right?

Wait, in the metric ds² = g_rr dr² + 2 g_rθ dr dθ + g_θθ dθ². But looking at the given metric, there's no cross term (like dr dθ), so g_rθ is zero. So the area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ, which is sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) dr dθ.

Wait, wait, more carefully: g_rr is the coefficient of dr², which is 32/(4 - r²). g_θθ is the coefficient of dθ², which is 32 r²/(4 - r²). So for the area element, it's sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ.

So let me compute that: sqrt( [32/(4-r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = sqrt( (1024 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²). Because sqrt(1024) is 32, and sqrt(r²) is r, as r is positive.

So the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but in this case, what are the limits of integration for r? Because when I'm calculating the area of the pseudosphere, I need to integrate over all allowed r. Let's see: the denominator is 4 - r², so the metric would blow up when r² = 4, which is r=2. So I think the allowed range for r is from 0 up to 2, because beyond that, the denominator becomes negative, and the metric would have imaginary components, which doesn't make physical sense. So r goes from 0 to 2.

So to find the area, I need to integrate dA over r from 0 to 2 and θ from 0 to 2π. Let's set up the integral.

Area = ∫∫ dA = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Since the integrand doesn't depend on θ, we can separate the integrals.

Area = [ ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ] * [ ∫ (0 to 2) (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr ]

Compute the θ integral first: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

Now the r integral: ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr. Let me substitute u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [32/(u)] (-du/2) ) = (32/(-2)) ∫ from u=4 to 0 [1/u] du. Wait, let's compute this step by step.

Integral of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [32 * (1/u) ] * (-du/2).

So 32 * (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du = (-16) [ ln(u) evaluated from 4 to 0 ].

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0, and the substitution is u=4 to u=0, so the limits are reversed. So the integral becomes:

(-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So ln(0) = -infinity. So that's (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-16)( -infty - ln4) → which is positive infinity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when I do u substitution, the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this without substitution. Let me set denominator as 4 - r², so derivative is -2r.

So the integrand is (r dr)/(4 - r²) = (-1/2) ( -2r dr )/(4 - r²) ) = -(1/2) d(4 - r²)/(4 - r²).

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = -(1/2) ∫ [d(4 - r²)/(4 - r²)] ) = -(1/2) ln|4 - r²| + C.

Evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: -(1/2) ln(0) → -(1/2) * (-infty) → positive infinity.

At r=0: -(1/2) ln(4) → finite.

So the integral from 0 to 2 becomes [positive infinity] - [finite value], which is positive infinity.

Wait, but wait, the integral would be:

[ -(1/2) ln(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2 = [ -(1/2) ln(0) ) – ( -(1/2) ln(4) ) ]

Which is [ (1/2) * infinity ) + (1/2) ln4 )

So the integral is divergent; it goes to infinity.

But when I multiplied by 32, the integral becomes 32 * (infinite) → also infinite.

So the area integral is (32) * integral, which would be infinite.

Wait, but wait, the area element was (32 r/(4 - r²)) dr dθ, so the integral over r is from 0 to 2, and when I compute that, it's divergent. So the area is infinite.

But looking back, the question says "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So the answer might be that the area is infinite, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but wait: I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Or is it that this specific metric leads to an infinite area?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The metric given is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, it's ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, but the line element becomes singular at r=2, because denominator becomes zero. So the surface is a pseudosphere that extends up to r=2. But perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral. Let's re-calculate the integral.

Wait, the area is given by ∫∫ sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ.

Which we found as sqrt( [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] ) = sqrt( (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) = (32 r)/(4 - r²).

So dA = (32 r)/(4 -r²) dr dθ.

Then Area = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the integral over θ is 2π.

The integral over r is ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this again. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2 r dr → - (du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [32 / u ] * (-du/2) )

= 32 * ( -1/2 ) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du )

= -16 [ ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du ]

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ]

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity, so:

= -16 ( (-infty) - ln4 )

= -16 ( -infty - a finite number )

Which is -16 * (-infty) → positive infinity.

So the integral is infinite.

So the area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To compute the area of the pseudosphere, we first convert the metric to polar coordinates. Let \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), so \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \). The metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in a 2D metric is given by \( dA = \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta \). Here, \( g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) and \( g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} \). Thus:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2}} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The area is then computed by integrating \( dA \) over the allowed range of \( r \) and \( \theta \). The radial coordinate \( r \) ranges from 0 to 2 because the metric becomes singular at \( r = 2 \) (denominator \( 4 - r^2 \) becomes zero). The angular coordinate \( \theta \) ranges from 0 to \( 2\pi \). The area is:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, integrate over \( r \). Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) or \( -\frac{du}{2} = r \, dr \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \cdot \left(-\frac{du}{2}\right) = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

Reversing the limits:

\[
-16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Here, \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**

- **A) 0:** Incorrect. The pseudosphere is an infinite surface, and its area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \):** Incorrect. This does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \):** Incorrect. This is not relevant to the given metric or the pseudosphere.
- **D) \( +\infty \):** Correct. The area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \), leading to an infinite area.
