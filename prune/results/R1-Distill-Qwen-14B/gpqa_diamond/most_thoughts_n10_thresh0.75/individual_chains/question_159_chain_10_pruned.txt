Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a quasar's spectrum and trying to figure out the comoving distance. Hmm, let me break it down.

The question mentions observations in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember that in quasars, emission lines like Lyman alpha or others could be causing this. Oh, right! The Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but if the quasar's light is redshifted, it might appear in the optical or infrared.

So the peak at 790 nm suggests a redshift. Let me think, the Lyman alpha line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, the redshift z is (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121.6)/121.6 = roughly 668.4 / 121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z is about 5.5. Wait, but wait, that's if it's the Lyman alpha line. Are there other possibilities? Maybe other lines, but Lyman alpha is a common one for quasars.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The universe's parameters are given: Hubble constant H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and it's flat. So we're to find the comoving distance at a=1 (now) to the quasar at redshift z=5.5.

Wait, comoving distance is the distance in the universe's geometry. But wait, wait, I might be getting confused between comoving distance and other distances. The comoving distance Dc is related to the line-of-sight comoving coordinate, which depends on the integral of 1/H(z) from 0 to z.

But wait, the formula for comoving distance is Dc = (1+z) * proper distance. Or another way: Dc is the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z)) dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Oh wait, E(z) is the expansion factor, so E(z)=sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωr*(1+z)^4 + Ωλ), but here Ωr is negligible, so E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So to find Dc, I need to compute the integral of 1/(E(z)) dz from 0 to z=5.5, then multiply by c/H0. Hmm, but I don't remember the exact integral, so maybe I should think about approximate values.

I recall that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance at high redshifts can be approximated. Let me think about some approximate values for z=5.5. Maybe I can use an online calculator or a standard formula.

Wait, I think I remember that for a given z, the comoving distance can be found using the formula:

Dc = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)] dz'

But integrating this exactly might be time-consuming without a calculator. Alternatively, I can use a lookup table or remember some approximate values.

I've heard that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc with H0=70, but wait, that's for H0=70. Let me think, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, which is 70 / (10^3 * 3.086e19 m) ) s^-1. But maybe I don't need to compute that exactly. Wait, the units for the comoving distance would be in gigaparsecs.

Wait, I remember that when I have H0=70, the comoving distance for z=2 is around 4 Gpc. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Some sources I've seen:

At z=0.5, Dc is about 1.7 Gpc.
z=1: ~3.3 Gpc
z=2: ~6.0 Gpc
z=3: ~8.8 Gpc
z=4: ~10.5 Gpc
z=5: ~11.8 Gpc
z=6: ~13 Gpc

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, for high z, the expansion is dominated by dark energy, so the integral grows more slowly.

Wait, but wait, z=5.5 is a high redshift, so the universe was matter-dominated at that time, because matter density scales as (1+z)^3, so at z=5.5, the matter density is 0.3*(1+5.5)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3= 0.3 * 274.625 = about 82.39. Compare with dark energy, which is 0.7, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(82.39 + 0.7) ≈ sqrt(83.09) ≈ 9.115. So E(z) is high, so 1/E(z) is small, meaning the integrand is small.

Wait, but when integrating from 0 to z, the early part (lower z) might have different E(z) values. Hmm, perhaps using a better approximation.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.
