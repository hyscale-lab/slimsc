Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves back and forth, and we detect shifts in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data here is the shift in the spectral lines—Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the planet's orbital period?

I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K, which is the star's velocity. K is given by ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1 / (2π)) * (1 / (1 AU)) ) * (1 / (1 year)) )? Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula in terms of the parameters they gave.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is the velocity semi-amplitude of the star's reflex motion. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity. But in this case, they're just giving the wavelength shift, which is related to K.

The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to the velocity (v) of the star. The formula is Δλ/λ = v / c, where c is the speed of light. But since the shifts are given in milliangstroms, and the central wavelength isn't given, perhaps I can relate the shifts directly to the velocities.

Wait, the shifts are given as 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 2 respectively. Let me denote the shifts as Δλ1 and Δλ2. So Δλ1 =5, Δλ2=7.

The velocity is proportional to Δλ. So K1 = (Δλ1 / λ) * c, K2 = (Δλ2 / λ) * c. So K2/K1 = (7/5) = 1.4. But
