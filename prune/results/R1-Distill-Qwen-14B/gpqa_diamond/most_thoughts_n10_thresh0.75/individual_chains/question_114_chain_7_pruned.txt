Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. There are two reactions described, and four options (A to D) to choose from. Let me look at each reaction carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with CN-, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, perhaps this is a cyanide addition to a ketone.

Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So maybe the reaction is adding CN- to the ketone, which would then form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is a reaction where a nitrile and an alcohol group are added to the carbonyl carbon. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin.

But wait, how is the cyanohydrin formed? Typically, this requires an acid catalyst. Right, because the mechanism involves protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. Then the CN- attacks, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. After that, water leaves as H2O, giving the cyanohydrin. But wait, in the first reaction, the product has both the hydroxyl and nitrile groups.

Wait, but in the product 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, wait, but the starting ketone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding a cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so the carbonyl is in the middle. Adding CN- would add a CN to the carbonyl carbon and an OH group on the adjacent oxygen.

Wait, actually, the cyanohydrin formation adds both groups. So the product would have a hydroxyl group
