Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, isn't that under specific conditions? Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins. So the reaction is adding CN- to the carbonyl group.

But wait, what's the mechanism here. The ketone has a carbonyl, which is attacked by the cyanide ion. This would form a cyanohydrin, so the product would have an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

But how is this reaction carried out? I think the reaction typically uses an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile, so you need something to protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make the carbonyl more electrophilic. So adding H3O+ (acid) would help. Alternatively, maybe another acid like H2SO4? Wait, the options have A as either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, the first reagent is A. So the options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me think about the conditions. The cyanide ion would require an acidic condition to form the cyanohydrin. So adding H3O+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

Alternatively, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I think that's used in some other reactions, like the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, bisulfite is used for the formation of sulfites, perhaps in the hydroxy sulfite addition, but I don't think that's the case here because the product is a cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A should be an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the reagent B (with H2O) gives 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under various conditions. For the formation of carboxylic acids, the usual conditions are strong acid or base with heat. Alternatively, using HCl (a strong acid) and H2O, or maybe under basic conditions with something like KMnO4?

Wait, first, the nitrile is at the end, but in this case, the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So the structure is probably something like (CH2)2CN with a benzyl group and OH on the same carbon.

Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the butanenitrile part is CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Hmm, perhaps the nitrile is at the end of the chain.

The reaction is converting the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

The typical conditions for this are either strong acid (like HCl) with H2O and heat, or strong base (like KOH) with H2O and heat. Wait, but sometimes it's in
