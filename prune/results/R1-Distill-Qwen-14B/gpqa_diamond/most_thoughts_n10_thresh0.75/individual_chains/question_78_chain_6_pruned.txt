Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). We're to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r at time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. 

I remember that potentials are related to the fields through Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. The electric field E is -∇V - ∂A/∂t, and the magnetic field B is ∇×A.

Wait, but how do we find V and A based on the moving charge? Oh, right, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

Let me think about the expressions for V and A. The scalar potential V is usually given by the Coulomb potential, something like V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But wait, when the charge is moving, does that affect V? I'm a bit confused. Oh, no, wait. The scalar potential for a moving charge might not just be the Coulomb potential because the charge's velocity could influence it through some sort of time delay or relativistic effect, but maybe in the non-relativistic case, it's just the Coulomb potential at the retarded time.

Wait, the problem mentions that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, the field at time t (t > tr) is due to the charge's state at tr. So the distance between the charge's position at tr (let's call that point r') and the observation point r is d = r - r'(tr). So the magnitude of d is the distance between them.

But for static charges, V is q/(4πε₀ |r - r'|), but when the charge is moving, maybe it's different. Oh, wait, but the scalar potential for a charge in motion is still V = q/(4πε₀ |d|), because the scalar potential depends on the charge's position at the retarded time. So perhaps V is the same as the static case, but evaluated at the retarded position.

Wait, but in some cases, like when considering radiation, there are higher-order terms, but this seems to be a basic setup, so probably just the Coulomb potential.

Then the vector potential A. I remember that the vector potential due to a charge in motion is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * something. Let me think. The general expression for A is (μ₀ q/(4π c²)) * v̂, where v is the velocity, but maybe at the retarded time.

Wait, no, more precisely, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π c²)) * (q v(t_r) / (d)), where d is the distance between the charge's position at t_r and the observation point. So A is proportional
