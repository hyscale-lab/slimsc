Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as each other, similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding how the RV method relates the Doppler shift to the planet's orbital period. I remember that the RV signal (the velocity semi-amplitude) depends on several factors, including the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and planet.

Wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K (the velocity) is K = (v) = ( (G*M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) )

But wait, since e (eccentricity) is zero here (the orbits are circular), that last term is 1. And the planet mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, so the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1. So the formula simplifies a bit. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let me think again. The actual formula I recall is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π)/(P) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is
