Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow.

Alright, the question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Plus, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, that's a lot, but let's break it down.

I remember that in IUPAC naming, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to the functional group with the highest priority. The functional groups here include a carboxylic acid (which has the highest priority), so the numbering starts from there.

So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the parent chain is benzoic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1 by default. Then, the numbering goes around the ring from there.

Now, the substituents are arranged as follows: all three (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are meta to each other. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the aldehyde and cyano would be at positions 3 and 5, but I need to check their arrangement.

Wait, wait. The three groups (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are all meta to one another. That means each is separated by two carbons, so they form a triangle around the ring. So, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the aldehyde and cyano would be at positions 3 and 5. But which is which?

Wait, the question also mentions that ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So positions 2 and 6? Because ortho is adjacent to position 1. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2.

Then, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is across
