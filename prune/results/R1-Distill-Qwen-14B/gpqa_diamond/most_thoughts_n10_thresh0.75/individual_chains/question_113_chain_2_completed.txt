Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the different characterization techniques mentioned: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives different clues about the structure of the compound.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is likely due to O-H stretching, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the absorption is very broad, which could suggest either a strong hydrogen bonding, like in a carboxylic acid, or perhaps an -OH group in a different context. Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which typically indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which could be due to conjugation or another type of carbonyl, like an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

Hmm, but wait, the 1650 might also be a C=C stretching vibration. Because in IR, C=C double bonds can absorb in that region. So maybe there's a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So that could be something like a ketone with a double bond adjacent.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, perhaps next to a carbonyl group. That would fit with the IR data if the 1650 cm^-1 is a conjugated carbonyl.

Now the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, often corresponding to (CH3)2O or maybe other structures. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H9O or something. Alternatively, it could be a fragment like a ketene or an aldehyde. Wait, another possibility: the methyl group attached to oxygen. Wait, I think the fragment at 45 could be (CH3)2CHO− or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO+ group, which would be 43 (CH3CO+ is 43, but wait, 45 would be CH3CO with an extra something). Wait, maybe it's a different structure. Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has a molecular weight of 58 (12*3 + 1*6 + 16 = 36 +6 +16=58). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like CH3CH2O+ (but that's 45? Let's calculate: CH3CH2O+ would be 12*2 + 1*5 +16 = 24 +5 +16=45. Oh right, that makes sense. So the fragment could be CH2CH2O, but more accurately, maybe the ethoxy group as a fragment.

Wait, but wait, the possible compounds given are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's think about their possible structures.

Looking at the possible options:

Option A: C6H12O2. That would have a degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring and a double bond, or a double bond and two rings, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. Degree of unsaturation: (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (12 +2 -10 -2*1)/2= (14-10-2)/2=(2)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. Hmm, but with two oxygen atoms. That could be a carbonyl group and maybe an ether or another carbonyl.

Option D: C6H12O. Degree of unsaturation: (12 +2 -12 -1*0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, maybe a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond, which contributes to the degree of unsaturation. Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it has one degree of unsaturation, that could be a ring, or a double bond. But if it's a double bond, then the formula would require that. So maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, or maybe something like a diester.

Option B: C6H10O. Two degrees, so perhaps a ring plus a double bond. Or two double bonds. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which would require a double bond. So that suggests that one of the degrees is a carbonyl (which is a double bond). So in B, two degrees: one from carbonyl (C=O), and another from a ring or another double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. One degree: so either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So this would contribute the one degree. So in this case, the structure must have a double bond and two oxygen atoms. Possibly an ester or a ketone, but with another oxygen.

Option D: C6H12O. One degree, which could be a ring or a double bond. But again, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Now, mass spec: m/z 45. So let's think about the possible structures and their fragments.

If the compound is an ester, for example, it might break into the ester group. Suppose the molecule is something like an ester with a double bond. For example, maybe it's methyl vinyl something. Alternatively, thinking about the molecular formula, perhaps it's something like methyl acrylate, but the formulas don't match exactly.

Wait, another approach: what's the possible molecular weight of each option? Let's calculate that.

Option A: C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. Total 72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spectrum shows a peak at 45, which is about half the molecular weight of option D (100/2=50), but 45 is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, the fragment could be a smaller piece of the molecule.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures. Let's consider each option's possible structure.

Given the IR data: broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretch, probably in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broader than an alcohol. Also, the strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the O-H would be very broad. But then there's the peak at 1650, which might be another carbonyl. But that seems unlikely because a carboxylic acid would have only one carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have a carbonyl around 1700-1750. But if it's conjugated, maybe it's lower, like 1650.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 cm^-1 could be a conjugated carbonyl, such as in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (e.g., vinyl acetate or something similar). So the structure might have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

So, in that case, the structure would have both a carbonyl and a double bond. Which would account for the peaks in IR and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.

Now, considering the possible structures. Let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. That could be a diester or a cyclic ester (lactone). Or maybe a ketone with an ester group, but that's less likely. But with two oxygen atoms. If it's a diester, perhaps something like diethyl succinate, but that's longer. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring with ester groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester or ketone group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation is 1, so either a ring or a double bond. But since we have a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR), that would account for one degree. So the other oxygen would be part of an ether or ester or something.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about option C: C6H10O2. Degree of unsaturation is 1. So with the double bond, that's accounted for. So the other oxygen would be another functional group. So, perhaps it's a ketone and an ester? But that might require more carbons.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. If the molecular ion is around 114 (option C) or 116 (option A), then 45 would be a fragment that's about 40% of the molecular weight. But how does that fragment form?

Alternatively, the fragment could come from cleavage of the molecule. For example, in an ester, the ester group can cleave to form an alkoxide and an acylium ion. The alkoxide would be (CH3O-), which has a molecular weight of 31, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl group (15) or ethyl (29) or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O- group. The molecular weight of CH2CH2O is 45 (12*2 + 1*4 +16=24+4+16=44? Wait, no: 12*2 is 24, 1*4 is 4, O is 16: total 44. Oh wait, that can't be. So CH2CH2O is 44, but the fragment is 45. Hmm, maybe it's CH2CH2O plus a hydrogen? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH3)2CO+ ion, which is acetone. Acetone has a molecular weight of 58, so that's not matching. Wait, but the (CH3)2CO+ would be 58, but the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a substituted cyclic ester. Or perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like methyl acrylate. But methyl acrylate is C4H6O2. That's too small. So for C6H10O2, perhaps it's a diester or a more complex structure.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule is a diester, like perhaps something with two ester groups. But for C6H10O2, that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and two oxygens. Let's see: perhaps it's a six-membered ring with two ester groups. Or maybe a chain with two ester groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggest a double bond, and the IR suggests a carbonyl. So a structure with both a double bond and a carbonyl group. If the carbonyl is conjugated to the double bond, that would lower the wavenumber, which fits with the 1650 cm^-1.

So, for C6H10O2: structure could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but let's count the carbons. Let's say R is CH2CH2O, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-R, but let's see. Let me think of a specific example. For instance, if R is CH2CH3, then the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. But what's the molecular formula of that? Let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Like a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula of each option and see what the possible structures are.

Option A: C6H12O2. So 6 carbons, 12 H's, 2 O's. Maybe it's a diol ester, but more likely, perhaps a cyclic ester. Or maybe a ketone with an ether group. Or a substituted cyclohexane with an ester group.

Wait, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so the structure must have that. So, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think again about the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Suppose the compound is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Its molecular formula is C5H8O2. The m/z would be 100 (since 5*12=60, 8=8, 32=32; 60+8+32=100). But that's not one of the options here. So maybe the fragment is from the ester part.

Wait, in ethyl acrylate, the ester group is O-CO-O. So when it fragments, perhaps it breaks between the ester oxygen and the carbonyl. That would give a fragment with the ethoxy group: CH2CH3O- with a charge. The molecular weight of that is 45 (12*2 + 1*5 +16=24+5+16=45). Oh! So that's the fragment at m/z 45.

So if the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, then the mass spec would show a fragment at 45. So which of the options have an ethoxy group?

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, perhaps like ethyl something. Let's see, ethyl would contribute 2 carbons, so the other part would be 4 carbons. So for example, ethyl butyrate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3, which is C5H10O2. But our option A is C6H12O2. So that doesn't match.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is methyl vinyl something. Wait, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, which has the formula C4H6O2. Again, not matching.

Wait, so if the fragment is from the ethoxy group (CH2CH3O+), that implies that the molecule has an ethoxy group. So the molecular formula should have at least two oxygen atoms if it's an ester, which options A and C have.

So, let's think about the ester formula. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So for ethyl something, R' is ethyl (two carbons), so R would be (n-4 carbons). So if the compound is C6H12O2, and it's an ester with ethoxy group, then R would be four carbons. But four carbons in an ester would be something like ethyl something. Let's see: ethyl hexanoate is C7H14O2, which is larger than our options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is a cyclic ester with four carbons, but that's formula C4H6O2. Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the compound isn't an ester but another type of oxygen-containing compound. Let's think about the IR peaks again.

The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then the other peak at 1700 cm^-1 would be the carbonyl of the acid. But then why is there a peak at 1650? That doesn't fit. Unless it's a conjugated carbonyl, but in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe that's not the case.

Another possibility is that the compound is an alcohol with a carbonyl group. But that would require another oxygen, making it a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, the compound could be a ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, but the FTIR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. If it's a ketone, the 1700 peak would fit, but the 1650 would be from a C=C. So a conjugated ketone with a double bond nearby.

So, the structure would have a ketone and a double bond. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas.

Looking at Option C: C6H10O2. That would require two oxygen atoms. For example, a ketone and an alcohol group. But then the structure would have both a C=O and a C-O-H group. But that would make the O-H broad, which fits the IR. Also, the presence of a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl would explain the IR peaks.

Alternatively, the compound could be a cyclic ketone with an alcohol, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each option's possible molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2 has a molecular weight of 116. If the fragment is 45, which is about 39% of the molecular weight. That could be a possibility.

Option C: molecular weight 114. 45 is about 39.4%. So similar.

But the fragment in mass spectrometry is often a result of breaking a bond. For esters, as I thought earlier, the ethoxy group (45) would come off as a fragment.

So if the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, then the fragment would be at 45. So which options have an ethoxy group?

Well, the formula for ethoxy is C2H5O. So in the compound, the ester would contribute two oxygens? No, wait, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the oxygens are in the ester group. So in the molecular formula, the ester would contribute two oxygens.

So looking at the options, options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) have two oxygens, which could correspond to an ester group.

So let's think of a possible ester structure with an ethoxy group and a double bond.

For example, ethyl something-enoate. Let's see: ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which is C5H8O2. But our options are for six carbons. So perhaps something like ethyl hex-2-enoate? Wait, hex-2-enoic acid would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. The ester would be ethyl hex-2-enoate: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. But that's seven carbons in the acid part, making the ester have nine carbons? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R' is hex-2-enoate (5 carbons), plus ethoxy (2 carbons), that would be 7 carbons, which is more than our options.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is between an ethyl group and a four-carbon acid. So, ethyl but-2-enoate: CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C6H10O2. Wait, let's count: ethyl is 2 carbons, butenoate is 4 (CH2=CHCH2COO-). So total 6 carbons. Hydrogens: the acid part (but-2-enoic acid) would be CH2=CHCH2COOH: 4 carbons, formula C4H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, it becomes CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the hydrogens: CH2=CHCH2-COOCH2CH3.

Structure:

CH2=CH-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3

Breaking it down:

CH2=CH-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H, but double bonds have less.

But let's count all H's:

CH2=CH: each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces by one from each CH2. So CH2=CH has 2+1=3 H.

CH2-CO: the CH2 has 2 H.

CO-O-CH2CH3: the OCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2 has 2, CH3 has 3).

Wait, perhaps a better way: the molecular formula for ethyl but-2-enoate is C6H10O2.

Because:

But-2-enoic acid is CH2CHCH2COOH → C4H6O2.

Esterification with ethanol (C2H5OH) replaces the -OH with OCH2CH3. So the ester becomes CH2CHCH2COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C6H10O2.

Which matches option C.

So, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

Now, let's tie this back into the IR and NMR data.

The IR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which would correspond to an O-H stretch. But in an ester, there's no O-H group. Wait, that's a problem. Because esters don't have O-H groups. So if the IR shows a broad peak, that suggests an O-H, which would indicate the compound is a carboxylic acid or an alcohol, not an ester.

Hmm, this is confusing. So if the compound is an ester, we wouldn't expect a broad O-H peak. So that suggests that my previous assumption might be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak isn't from an O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but then the ester would have another oxygen. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR peak at 1700 cm^-1 is strong, which is typical for an ester or a ketone. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester.

So perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester with an O-H group elsewhere. But that would require another oxygen, making the formula C6H10O2 (since O-H would add an oxygen).

Wait, but in that case, the ester is O-CO-O, so two oxygens, and the O-H would be a third, which isn't possible because the options don't have three oxygens.

Hmm, maybe the broad peak isn't an O-H. Could it be something else? Broad peaks around 3000 can also be due to N-H stretching, but the options don't include nitrogen. So probably an O-H.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl and an aromatic ring, but the options don't suggest that. Also, the NMR shows vinyl H, which suggests a double bond, not necessarily an aromatic ring.

Another angle: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond suggests an enone structure (like in beta-diketones). But the O-H would be an issue again.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diol, but with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, cyclic esters, perhaps a ketone with an alcohol group.

Option B: C6H10O. Could be an alcohol with a carbonyl group, but the formula only has one O. So maybe a ketone and an alcohol? No, that would require two O's. Hmm, maybe a cyclic ether with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possibilities: ester with a double bond, or a ketone with an alcohol group.

Option D: C6H12O. Possibilities: alcohol with a double bond, or a cyclic ether with a double bond.

But the IR has a broad O-H, which would fit with an alcohol (option D) or a carboxylic acid (but that would require another O, so perhaps not). Wait, if the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl group, that would require two O's, which would make it option C or A.

Wait, perhaps it's a diol, but that might not explain the IR.

Alternatively, let's think about the IR peaks again. If the compound has a conjugated carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone next to a double bond. So, for example, something like cyclohexenone. But cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Wait, but that would be option B. Let's see: cyclohexenone has a molecular formula of C6H10O. So that fits option B. The IR would show a strong peak around 1700 for the ketone and a peak around 1650 for the conjugated double bond. The O-H would have to come from somewhere else, but cyclohexenone doesn't have an O-H group. So that doesn't fit the IR data.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the presence of a broad O-H peak suggests an alcohol or acid, but the other peaks suggest a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto alcohol. So, for example, something like CH2=C(CO-OH)CH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, a structure where the alcohol is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl alcohol, but that's not stable. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something similar, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a gamma or delta lactone. Lactones have an ester group, but they also have a ring. So, a five-membered ring lactone would have the ester, and perhaps a double bond nearby. But would that explain the O-H in the IR? Lactones don't have O-H groups because they're cyclic esters. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an alcohol and a ketone. For example, cyclohexenol with a ketone group. But that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxyketone, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. That's characteristic of an O-H stretch, but it's broad, which usually suggests a hydrogen-bonded O-H, like in a carboxylic acid. However, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. But the second peak at 1650 cm^-1 doesn't fit, unless it's some sort of conjugation. Wait, but carboxylic acids generally don't have a C=C stretch. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a phenol, but the options don't include aromatic carbons, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the 1650 cm^-1 is not a C=C but a C-O stretch? No, C-O stretching is usually around 1250-1050 cm^-1. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the 1650 cm^-1 is a conjugated C=C. So the structure has both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

So, putting it all together: the compound has a carbonyl group (maybe ester, ketone, or acid), a conjugated double bond (so IR peak at 1650), and an O-H group (broad peak at 3000). So, that would require three oxygen atoms? No, because the options have at most two (options A and C).

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, it would have two oxygen atoms (COOH), and the conjugated double bond would require a third? No, because the formula only has two O's. So perhaps the O-H is not from a carboxylic acid but from an alcohol. But then, the compound would have a ketone or ester group and an alcohol group.

So, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCO-O-R and an -OH group somewhere. But that would require three O's, which isn't possible with the given options.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again about the possible structures. Let's re-examine the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diester, but that would require two ester groups, which is less likely.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a double bond.

Wait, but the O-H in the IR suggests an alcohol or acid. So if the compound is an ester, there shouldn't be an O-H group. So perhaps the O-H is not from an ester, but from another group, like an alcohol and an ester together. But that would require three O's, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's more advanced and perhaps not in the scope of this problem.

Another thought: Maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal, which would have both an O-H and an ether linkage. But I'm not sure how that would fit the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but there are no aromatic carbons in the options given.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a ketone and an alcohol group in the same molecule, but that would require two O's. So, for example, a structure like (CH2)2C(OH)COOR. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol with a conjugated carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to summarize what I have:

- IR: broad O-H (probably), strong C=O (1700), and C=C (1650).

- NMR: vinyl H's, so double bond present.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45, likely CH2CH2O+ (45).

So, the structure has a double bond, a carbonyl (probably ester or ketone), and an O-H group.

Wait, but if the fragment is CH2CH2O (45), that suggests an ethoxy group in the structure. So, the compound must have an ethoxy group.

If the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, but the IR shows an O-H, that's conflicting. Because esters don't have O-H groups.

So perhaps the O-H is part of the molecule in another way. Maybe it's a hemiacetal or another functional group.

Wait, another angle: The IR has a peak at 1700 cm^-1, which could be a conjugated carbonyl like an ester, and the O-H could be from an alcohol adjacent to the ester. But that would require another oxygen, making the formula C6H10O2 (option C).

So, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2-O-H. But that seems unlikely and perhaps not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a hydroxyl group nearby. For example, something like HO-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a beta-diketone with an ethoxy group. But that would make the formula different.

I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The mass spec fragment at 45 suggests an ethoxy group. So the compound has an ethoxy group attached via an ester (since it's a common fragment in esters). So the formula must have two oxygens (ester has two oxygens). So options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2) are candidates.

If the compound is an ester, but the IR shows an O-H, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the O-H isn't from the compound itself but from something else in the sample. That's unlikely, though.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carbonyl, making it a hemiacetal or something else. Or, the O-H is from an alcohol that's part of the molecule along with the ester.

But then the formula would require three oxygens, which isn't the case.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the O-H is part of a conjugated system, like in an enol. Enols have an O-H group adjacent to a carbonyl, but they are usually in a conjugated system with a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is an enol ester or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is part of an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, an ester with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. But that would require another oxygen, making the formula have three oxygens, which is not the case.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the given data.

The fragment at 45 is likely from an ethoxy group. So the compound has an ethoxy group, which is part of an ester. So the formula must be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A).

The IR shows a broad O-H, which doesn't fit with an ester. So perhaps the O-H is from another group, like an alcohol. But that would require the compound to have both an ester and an alcohol group, which would require three oxygens. But the options don't have that. So maybe the O-H is from a different source, like a solvent or another compound in the sample. That's unlikely, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 1700 cm^-1 peak is from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. And the O-H is from a different group. But then how do the oxygens add up?

Wait, if the compound is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group, the formula would be C6H10O2 (since it has a ketone O and an alcohol O). So option C.

So, the structure would be something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-CO-R. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated dienone with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

In any case, given the IR data and the mass spec, I think the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group. The broad O-H might be a mistake, or perhaps it's from another group that I'm not considering. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak isn't an O-H but something else, like an N-H stretch, but the options don't include nitrogen.

Wait, wait a minute. Another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be due to an amine's N-H stretch, but the options don't have nitrogen. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a C-H stretch, but that's usually not very broad.

So, given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2, which is an ester with an ethoxy group and a conjugated double bond. The fragment in the mass spec supports this. The O-H peak might be from another group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group somewhere else in the molecule, making the formula have two oxygens (one from the ester, one from the alcohol). But that would require the formula to have three oxygens, which isn't the case. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the mass spec and the ester part. The fragment at 45 suggests an ethoxy group. So the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, which would be option A or C. Looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, the structure could be ethyl something with six carbons. Let's say it's ethyl pentanoate, but that's C6H12O2. Wait, ethyl pentanoate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. That's five carbons in the acid part and two in the ethyl, making seven carbons. Hmm, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. That's four carbons (propionyl is three, ethyl is two). So for a six-carbon ester, maybe it's ethyl butyrate: CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. No, that's five carbons. So perhaps the structure is ethyl something with four carbons in the acid part. So, the acid would be four carbons, the ester would have two (ethyl), totaling six. That would make the formula C6H12O2. So ethyl butyrate is CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, no, ethyl butyrate is CH3CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. That's five carbons in the acid (butyric acid is four carbons, but the ester would have two, making six in total). So molecular formula is C6H12O2. So that would fit option A.

But wait, ethyl butyrate is CH3CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. So formula: C6H12O2. So the IR would have a carbonyl at 1700, and if there's a double bond, perhaps it's conjugated. But wait, ethyl butyrate doesn't have a double bond. So that doesn't fit the NMR data, which shows vinyl hydrogens.

So that's a problem. So the compound must have a double bond, which ethyl butyrate doesn't have. So that structure doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, like ethyl acrylate. But ethyl acrylate is C5H8O2, which doesn't match any of the given options except possibly option C if I'm missing something.

Wait, option C is C6H10O2. So if the structure is ethyl acrylate, but with an additional methyl group or some other substituent, it could fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), which is C5H8O2. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. But I'm not familiar with such a structure off the top of my head.

Another thought: maybe the structure is a dienol ester, but again, not sure.

In the end, given the data, the fragment at 45 suggests an ethoxy group, which supports options A and C. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, which fits with an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. The IR shows a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, which fits. The O-H peak is a bit confusing, but perhaps it's from another group.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is C: C6H10O2.


To identify the unknown compound, the spectroscopic data provided was analyzed as follows:

### FTIR Data:
- **Broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- **Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Likely corresponds to a conjugated C=C stretch, indicating the presence of a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

### Mass Spectrometry Data:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This is consistent with an ethoxy group (CH₃CH₂O⁺), which has a molecular weight of 45.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
   - Degree of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
   - This formula could correspond to a cyclic ester (lactone) or an ester with a saturated structure. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, which is not consistent with a fully saturated structure. Additionally, the broad O-H peak in the IR suggests the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid, which is not fully explained by this option.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
   - Degree of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
   - This formula could correspond to a compound with a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, the IR data suggests the presence of two oxygen-containing functional groups (C=O and O-H), which is not consistent with this formula.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
   - Degree of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
   - This formula is consistent with an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which would explain the conjugated C=C and C=O stretches in the IR spectrum. The ethoxy group (CH₃CH₂O⁺) accounts for the fragment peak at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum. The broad O-H peak in the IR could correspond to a hydroxyl group, though this is not explicitly required for the structure.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
   - Degree of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or double bond).
   - This formula could correspond to a saturated compound with a single oxygen-containing functional group. However, the IR data suggests the presence of both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group, which is not consistent with this formula.

### Conclusion:
The data is most consistent with **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it explains the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and double bond (IR), vinyl hydrogens (¹H NMR), and the ethoxy fragment in the mass spectrum. The broad O-H peak in the IR could correspond to a hydroxyl group, though it is not explicitly required for the structure.
