Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, maybe it's part of the cubic system? No, I think rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, but with all the edges equal and all the angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh wait, so in a rhombohedral structure, all a, b, c are equal, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal. So in this case, alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees, which makes sense.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think it's calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. Wait, the formula I remember is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ...), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, that's for cubic systems.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the lattice parameters multiplied by the Miller indices. Oh, right, it's more involved. The formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + ... ) but I think the exact formula depends on the crystal system.

Wait, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) * (sin² α / (1 - sin² α)) ) + ... ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe for a rhombohedral system, which is a special case, there's a simplified formula.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for any crystal system is given by:

d = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) ) / (2 (h k + k l + l h) cos θ) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think in a rhombohedral system, all a, b, c are equal, and all the angles are equal. So perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, another formula I came across is:

d
