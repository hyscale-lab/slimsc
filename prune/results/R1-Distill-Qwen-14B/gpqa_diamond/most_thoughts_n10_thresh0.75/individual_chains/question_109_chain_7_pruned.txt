Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and their quantum states. Hmm, I remember that nucleons are protons and neutrons, and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle because they are fermions. The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. The problem gives me some condition involving isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed.

Let me start by recalling what each part means. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S is 0 because 2*0 +1 =1. L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So L is 0 for S states. And J is 0, since J is the total angular momentum. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is the NN plus X. The problem says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, I think. So T = (S + L +1) mod 2.

The final NN state has T=0. So let's plug that into the equation. 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L +1 must be even because 0 mod 2 is 0. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. Wait, because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L +1) is even → (S+L) is odd.

So S + L is odd. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S even, L odd, or S odd, L even.

Now, the problem is about the partial waves of X. Each option gives a different state for X. The lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So, for example, option A is p, which is l=1 (since p is L=1). Option B is s, which is l=0. Option C is f, which is l=3. Option D is p again, l=1.

Partial waves are denoted by letters where s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc. So the angular momentum quantum number l of X is given by the letter.

The process is the initial state (1S0) → final state (NN) + X. The problem says to consider the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

So, for angular momentum, the initial state has J=0. The final state must have the total angular momentum J' such that when X is emitted, the angular momentum is conserved. Wait, but in terms of partial waves, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the total angular momentum of the NN system is S' (their spin) plus L' (their orbital angular momentum), which equals J'. Then, the initial J is 0, so J' (of NN) plus l (of X) must equal the initial J, right? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because the system emits X, so angular momentum is conserved, so the total angular momentum in the initial state (J=0) must equal the sum of the angular momenta of the final states (NN and X). But X is emitted, so it's moving away, so the orbital angular momentum between NN and X would contribute to the total.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the decay: the initial state is the NN system with J=0. After emitting X, the final state has the NN system (now in some state with their own S', L', J') and the X particle. The total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum is the sum of J' (of NN) and the angular momentum carried away by X. But the X's angular momentum is l, because it's a spin-0 or spin-1/2? Wait, I'm not sure about the spin of X. Wait, the question says X is a particle with intrinsic parity -1. But I don't know its spin. Hmm, but perhaps for this problem, X's spin doesn't matter because we're considering parity and angular momentum in the decay.

Wait, the problem is about partial waves, which are associated with the orbital angular momentum between the emitted particle and the remaining system. So when X is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the X with respect to the NN system is l. So the partial wave is the orbital angular momentum l of X.

So the initial angular momentum is 0. The final state has the NN system with J' = S' + L'
