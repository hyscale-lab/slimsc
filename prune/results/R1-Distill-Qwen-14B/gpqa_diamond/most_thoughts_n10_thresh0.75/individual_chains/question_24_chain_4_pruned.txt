Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water—wait, that usually means the substance has double bonds. Because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize. Oh, right, that's the test for unsaturation. So mixture X must contain compounds with double bonds.

Next, when this mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. But this time, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, so if the products don't have double bonds anymore, maybe X underwent a reaction that removed the double bonds. Oh wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh right, disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, the mixture X is a mixture of two liquids. So each of them might be undergoing a reaction.

Wait, but the problem says that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. So the reaction must have added hydrogen, maybe? Like a hydrogenation reaction. Oh, but wait, the catalyst used is platinum, which is used for hydrogenation. So maybe each component of X is hydrogenated to form the components of Y.

But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a reaction where it splits into two different products. Hmm, wait, but that might complicate things. Let me think again.

Wait, no—disproportionation typically involves a single species breaking into two, one with higher oxidation state and another with lower. But in this case, maybe the starting materials are each undergoing hydrogenation, which is adding hydrogen.

Wait, but the problem says when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y, which is a result of disproportionation. Oh, so perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. Like, for example, maybe an alkene is adding hydrogen in a way that leads to two different products. But that doesn't quite fit the typical concept of disproportionation.

Alternatively, perhaps
