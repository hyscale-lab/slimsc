Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two opposite faces of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination might happen here. Since it's a dihalide, dehydrohalogenation is likely, which would form an alkene. Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, KOH is also a good nucleophile. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of ring-opening? Hmm, but adamantane is a very rigid structure. Oh, wait, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) undergo elimination, they form alkenes. But in this case, the bromines are at 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure where each carbon is connected in a way that the positions 1 and 3 are on the same face but perhaps not adjacent? Or are they across a bridge? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the heating with KOH leads to a diepoxy structure? Wait, no, KOH wouldn't do that. Alternatively, maybe dehydrohalogenation forms an alkene, but since the starting material has two Br atoms, maybe two eliminations occur.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Light yellow makes me think of something like an epoxide, but wait, no. Another possibility is that the product is an ether. Wait, KOH can cause elimination or maybe even nucleophilic substitution, but substitution would require a good leaving group and perhaps a good solvent. Alternatively, considering that when two bromides are present, perhaps a double elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxide's carbonyl is around 1200-1300. Oh, wait,
