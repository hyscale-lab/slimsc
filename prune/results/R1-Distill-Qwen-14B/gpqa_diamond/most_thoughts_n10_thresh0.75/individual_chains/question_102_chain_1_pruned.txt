Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the setup: the ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So the receptor probably forms a barrel-like structure for binding ligands.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions. So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh, right, IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is being translated as a separate mRNA? Or perhaps from the same mRNA but using the IRES to drive its own translation.

The ligand has a stop cassette between it and mCherry with loxP. The receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272. So, the cassettes are different, probably so that Cre can only excise one at a time. LoxP is recognized by Cre, and I think lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (or maybe a different recognition site? Not entirely sure, but I know that lox2272 is a mutant loxP site used for Cre/Flp recombinases.)

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. So if the construct is working, they should see both the ligand and receptor proteins. However, when they look at the mouse model, they crossed it into SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be active in neural crest derivatives, like the cells where these genes might be expressed.

The offspring were visualized under confocal, and they didn't see a green signal. That suggests the eGFP wasn't expressed, or the receptor wasn't expressed in the right place. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If that's the case, maybe the ligand is secreted and acts on nearby receptors. But I'm not sure how that would affect the expression. The question is why the eGFP isn't showing up.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the protein isn't properly trafficked, it might accumulate in the Golgi and not reach the cell surface. So the eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why would that happen? Maybe if the signal peptide is missing or incorrect, but the construct seems designed correctly. Or perhaps the IRES isn't working, but I'm not sure.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. Both the ligand and receptor are expressed under certain promoters. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so maybe that's sufficient. The receptor is after the IRES, which is part of the same bicistronic construct. Wait, if the IRES is present, maybe the receptor is on the same transcript as the ligand but is translated after. Or perhaps the IRES allows for its own translation. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening in the right cells. But they used SOX10-Cre, which should activate the expression in neural crest cells. Alternatively, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active in those cells? Or maybe the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. Hmm, that's a possibility.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh wait, the ORF is followed by eGFP. If the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP should be in frame. But if the insertion wasn't done correctly, maybe they're not in frame. But the question says the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is active, it would excise the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together. If the eGFP is not in frame, the protein would be truncated or not made, so no fluorescence.

Wait, but in the construct, the receptor's ORF is after the IRES, and the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is probably in frame, because it's just the ORF followed by eGFP. Unless the fusion is not in frame, but the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP
