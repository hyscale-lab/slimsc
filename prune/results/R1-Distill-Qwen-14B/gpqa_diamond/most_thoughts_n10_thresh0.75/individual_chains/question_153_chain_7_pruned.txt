Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's go through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I think NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. So, in an enolate formation, the base deprotonates the alpha position of the carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When the base (NaOEt) is added, it deprotonates the alpha carbon, forming an enolate. The enolate has a negative charge on the beta carbon, making it a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. This is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of this acrylate.

So the attack would happen at the beta carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). Let me visualize this: the enolate has the structure -O-C-CH2-CO2Me, but wait, no, the enolate is CH2- that's deprotonated. So the enolate of malonate is (CH2-)-CO2Me-CH2-CO2Me. Wait, no, the structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2, so when deprotonated, the enolate is CH2=C(-O-)CO2Me? Hmm, maybe I should think of the enolate as CH2- attacking the acrylate.

Wait, the enolate would have a negative charge on the beta carbon. So when it attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, the attack is at the beta position of the double bond. So the Michael addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acceptor.

So, the structure of the product would be a combination of the two. The malonate part would add on, and the acrylate would contribute the rest.

Let me think. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH(p-tolyl)CO2Me, but wait, noâ€”actually, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, so maybe it's CH2CH2 with the substituents in a specific arrangement. Wait, perhaps it's more accurately represented as CH2-C(p-tolyl)-
