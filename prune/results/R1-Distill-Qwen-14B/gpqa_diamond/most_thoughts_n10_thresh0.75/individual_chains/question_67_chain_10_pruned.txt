Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, we've got two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. The question is about their coupled angular momentum state. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, let me parse that. So l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for particles 1 and 2. Since they're p orbitals, l must be 1 for each. So l₁=1 and l₂=1. The total angular momentum is l=2, and the z-component is m=-1.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ each. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ. Since each L_z has eigenvalues mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number, for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1 when l=1.

Wait, but if each L_z is measured as -ħ, that means m₁ = -1 for the first electron and m₂=-1 for the second. So what is the state when each has m=-1?

The given state is |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is |l1, l2, L, M> perhaps? Because typically, the coupled state is built from the individual states. L is the total angular momentum quantum number, and M is the z-component.

So I think the state is a combination of the individual angular momenta. So for two electrons, each with l=1, the possible total L can be l1 + l2, l1 + l2 -1, ..., down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, 1, 0. So possible L values are 2,1,0. But the given state has L=2.

Now, the state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> is a specific coupled state. But when you measure L1z and L2z, you're looking at the individual m1 and m2 values. The question is, what's the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because each L_z eigenvalue is -ħ.

Wait, but the given state is a coupled state, so it's a superposition of the product states of m1 and m2. So I think I need to expand the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states, which are |m1, m2> states.

Right, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states, where m1 is the magnetic quantum number for the first electron, and m2 for the second. The condition is that m1 + m2 = M.

In this case, M is -1. So the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-
