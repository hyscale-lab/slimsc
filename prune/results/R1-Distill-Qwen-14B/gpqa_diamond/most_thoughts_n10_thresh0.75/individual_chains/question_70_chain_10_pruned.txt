Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are related to the point groups in molecular symmetry, which describe the symmetry of molecules. So first, I need to figure out what E is, right? Let's break down the reactions given.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with a gas in such a way? Maybe something like a metal reacting with a diatomic gas? Oh wait, like sulfur and oxygen? Or maybe something else.

Then, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. So C and D are reacting in a 1:2 molar ratio? Or maybe 2 equivalents in total? I'm not entirely sure about the stoichiometry here.

Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong and weak acids... Hmm. The strong acid could be like HCl or H2SO4, and the weak like H2S or something else. Wait, but when a compound reacts with water to form two different acids, maybe it's something like a sulfite or sulfate? Or perhaps a nitrate?

Looking at the last clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, etc. But D and B in a 1:1 ratio... If B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2, and D is another gas, maybe H2O? Or perhaps another diatomic gas. Wait, when D and B form H, which is a solvent. So if B is O2, and D is H2, reacting 1:1 would form H2O, which is indeed a solvent. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the first reaction, B is a gas reacting with A. If B is O2, then A could be a metal. Like sulfur reacting with O2 to form SO3, but wait, sulfur is solid and O2 is gas. Alternatively, maybe another reaction.

Wait, let's think about the products. C reacts with D to form E. And C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a sulfide or a nitride. Alternatively, if C is a compound that breaks down in water into a metal and two acids.

Wait, let's think of the possible compounds. If C is SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO3 (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (a strong acid)? Wait, no, SO3 plus water would give H2SO4 only. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Let's see. If A is a metal like copper, and B is O2, then maybe A is Cu and B is O2, forming CuO? But CuO is black, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, bright red product C. What compounds are bright red? Could it be something like Fe(OH)3? No, that's reddish. Or maybe a sulfide? Like CuS is black. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrate complex or another compound.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider known reactions. For example, the reaction of a metal with Cl2 gas. For instance, copper reacting with Cl2 to form CuCl2, which is a green solid, not red. Hmm. Or maybe iron reacting with something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of a metal with sulfur vapor. Sulfur is a solid, and when it reacts with a metal like iron, it forms FeS or FeS2. But I'm not sure about the
