Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are observable by both. Let me think through each step.

First, I should understand the key information given. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than the brighter of these two limits. Wait, no, wait. Because if ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, and HIRES up to 16, a star needs to be brighter (i.e., have a lower magnitude number) than 17 to be seen by both? Because, wait, the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Brighter stars have lower magnitude numbers. So if a star has apparent V magnitude less than (brighter than) 17, ESPRESSO can see it. And for HIRES, it must be less than 16. So to be seen by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is 16.5 mag, ESPRESSO can't see it (since it's brighter than 17? Wait, wait, no, wait, no: the condition is that stars brighter than (apparent V magnitude) 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. So wait, the statement is a bit confusing. Let me re-read.

The question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh! Wait, so bright stars (lower magnitude) can be observed. So if a star is brighter (has a lower apparent V mag), both can see it. So for both to detect, the star must have apparent V mag brighter (i.e., lower) than 17 for ESPRESSO and lower than 16 for HIRES. So the limiting factor is 16 mag. So any star with V <16 can be seen by both, because HIRES can't see anything fainter than 16, and ESPRESSO can't see anything fainter than 17. So the overlap is stars brighter than 16 mag (V <16). So both have to have V <16.

Wait, but wait. The HIRES limit is brighter than 16, so it can see up to 16. If a star is 16.5, HIRES can't see it because it's fainter than 16. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16 (so both can see it), or between 16 and 17 for the other? Wait, no.

Wait, let me clarify. For a spectrograph, the more restrictive the limit, the more difficult it is to detect. So if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can detect stars with V up to 17. So V mag less than 17. HIRES can observe stars with V less than 16. So, for a star to be seen by both, it must have V less than 16. Because if it's V=16.5, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. So, the star must be brighter than both limits. Wait, no, wait. Because the question says, which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be bright enough to be seen by both. So, the apparent V mag must be below (brighter than) 16, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star must be brighter than 16, so that both can see it. Because if the star is 16.5, HIRES can't see it.

Wait, but what if the star is at V=16.5? HIRES can't, but ESPRESSO can. So, to be detected by both, the star must be V <16.

So let's look at each star's apparent V magnitude. Wait, some of the stars have absolute magnitudes but not apparent. Oh wait, the question gives some stars with absolute magnitudes, and others with apparent. So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude.

Wait, let me list each star:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V mag = absolute V + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So for d=10, modulus is 0. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So V=15.5 <16. So both can detect.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So no need to calculate; it's given as 16.5. So this is fainter than 16 (HIRES limit is 16, so Star2 is 16.5, which is fainter; so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17.

Wait, so Star2's V is 16.5. So ESPRESSO can detect it (as 16.5 <17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5 >16). So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5. But wait, no, wait. Star3 has apparent V mag 15.5? Let me check: no, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" — so V=15.5. Also, E(B-V)=0.6. Hmm. Oh wait, but the question says, the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So I think this is about interstellar extinction. So the observed apparent magnitude is dimmer than the intrinsic. Wait, no, the formula is: extinction A_V = R * E(B-V), where R is around 3.1. So the apparent V mag is the intrinsic V mag plus A_V. So the observed V mag is more than the intrinsic.

So for Star3: the apparent V is given as 15.5, but wait, no. Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Because if the star has E(B-V)=0.6, then the extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed V magnitude (apparent) is the intrinsic (which would be the absolute V mag) plus this extinction. But wait, Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5. Or no, wait: the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6". So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because if E(B-V) is 0.6, then the extinction A_v is 3.1 × 0.6 = 1.86.

Wait, but the apparent V magnitude is already given as 15.5, but that's after extinction. Because generally, the observed (apparent) magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V. So if the star's absolute magnitude is M, then the apparent magnitude is M + distance modulus + A_V.

Wait, but in Star3's case, the question says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So is that the observed, which includes the extinction, or is it the intrinsic magnitude before extinction? I think it's the observed, since it's given as apparent. So if the E(B-V) is 0.6, then the extinction A_V is 1.86. So the intrinsic magnitude would be M = m - A_V. So M =15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But wait, the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, which is already after extinction, so perhaps the given apparent mag is correct, and thus the star's apparent mag is 15.5. So, then, does that mean that the apparent V mag is 15.5, without considering the extinction? Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the apparent V mag is 15.5, but considering extinction, but wait, the question states that the total absorption is 3.1 × E(B-V), so A_V =3.1 ×E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_V =1.86. So if the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's after extinction, then the true magnitude (without extinction) would be lower. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The apparent magnitude we observe is the intrinsic magnitude plus the extinction. So m = M + 5log10(d/10) + A_V. So for Star3, to find its apparent V magnitude, I need to compute M (absolute) plus distance modulus plus A_V.

Wait, but the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps that apparent V includes the extinction. So the m is 15.5, which is the observed magnitude. So if I compute the absolute magnitude, M = m - 5 log10(d/10) - A_V.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about what each parameter represents. Let me see.

The question says, for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc. The note says: total absorption (extinction) in V band is 3.1 × E(B-V). So A_V =3.1 * 0.6 =1.86.

So, the apparent V magnitude (m) is affected by extinction. So the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

Wait, but wait: M is the absolute magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, with no extinction. So in reality, the star's apparent magnitude at distance d is M + 5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

So, in the case of Star3, the observed m is given as 15.5. So,

15.5 = M + 5 log(15/10) + 1.86.

Compute 5 log(15/10) =5 log(1.5). Log(1.5) is approx 0.176, so 5 * 0.176 ≈0.88.

So,

15.5 = M + 0.88 + 1.86 → M = 15.5 - 0.88 -1.86 = 15.5 - 2.74 =12.76.

Wait, but the question doesn't provide the absolute magnitude for Star3. It gives apparent V mag as 15.5, so perhaps that's the observed value, and the other parameters are given for calculation. So perhaps I don't need to calculate M for Star3 because the question gives m as 15.5, which is the observed apparent magnitude. So the star's apparent V is 15.5 mag.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the star is at 15 pc. Let me compute what the apparent mag would be without extinction. M is the absolute magnitude, and m would be M + 5 log10(15/10) = M + 0.88. So if the apparent mag without extinction is m0 = M +0.88. But with extinction, the observed m is m0 +1.86.

So, the observed m is 15.5, which is m0 + 1.86 → m0 =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be 13.64, which is brighter than the observed 15.5.

But this seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is providing the star's apparent magnitude after extinction, so we don't need to adjust it. So the star's apparent V is 15.5. So that's the value we should consider. So for Star3, V app is 15.5 <16. So both spectrographs can detect it. Wait, but wait, Star3's V is 15.5, which is less than 16, so HIRES can see it, and less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So yes, both can detect Star3.

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought. Wait, no, because 15.5 is less than 16, so both can see it.

Star4: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So let's compute apparent V mag.

Compute A_V =3.1 * 0.4=1.24.

Distance modulus is 5 log10(10/10) =0.

So apparent V mag without extinction is M +0 =15.5. But with extinction, it's 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So the observed apparent V mag is 16.74.

Wait, so Star4's apparent V is 16.74. So for HIRES, the limit is V <16, so 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.74 <17. So only ESPRESSO can see Star4.

Star5: absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Compute apparent V mag: distance modulus is 5 log10(5/10) =5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So apparent V mag is M + distance modulus: 16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995, approximately 15.0.

So, apparent V is 15.0. So that's less than 16. So both can detect it.

Wait, but Star5's absolute mag is 16.5. So with distance 5 pc, m =16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995, which is about 15.0.

So, V=15.0 <16, so both can see.

So now, let's check each star.

Star1: V=15.5 → can both detect.

Star2: V=16.5 → HIRES can't.

Star3: V=15.5 → both can detect.

Star4: V=16.74 → HIRES can't.

Star5: V=15.0 → both can detect.

Wait, but wait, Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is higher than 17? No, 16.74 is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can see it, since it's brighter than 17. But HIRES can't, because Star4 is 16.74>16.

So which stars have V mag <16? Let's see:

Star1: 15.5 → yes.

Star3: 15.5 → yes.

Star5: 15.0→ yes.

Star2:16.5→ no.

Star4:16.74 → no.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 has V=16.74, which is above 16. So HIRES can't see it.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both have V <16, so yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 V=16.5, can't be seen by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Wait, so the possible options are B and perhaps others. Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star5's V is 15.0, so both can see.

So let's verify each star:

Star1: V=15.5 → both yes.

Star3: V=15.5 → both yes.

Star5: V=15.0 → both yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → yes.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

Option B is one possible correct option.

But let me check the options. The options are given, so let me look:

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer would be the stars that have V <16.

So which options include only those stars.

Looking at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5 – both have V <16.

Option D: Star1 (15.5) and Star4 (16.74). Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, perhaps only Star3 and Star5 are in option B.

Wait, but wait another point: the question says which stars can be detected by both spectrographs.

So let me recheck each star.

Star1: V=15.5 (brighter than 17 and 16) → both can detect.

Star3: V=15.5 → both can.

Star5: V=15.0 → both can.

So all three can be detected by both.

But the options don't include any option with three stars. The options are pairs.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:

Wait, Star5's V is 15.0, so yes.

Star1's V is 15.5, yes.

Star3's V is 15.5, yes.

So which options include any of these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4's V=16.74, which is >16, so no.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both yes.

Option C: Star2 (16.5) and Star3 (15.5) → only Star3 can be seen by both, but Star2 can't.

Option D: Star1 (15.5) and Star4 (16.74) → Star1 is yes, Star4 no.

So the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't have a choice that includes all three. So perhaps the question is looking for which pair is correct.

Option B includes Star3 and Star5. Both have V=15.5 and 15.0, so both detectable.

Option D includes Star1 and Star4. Only Star1 is.

So in the options, only option B includes two stars that both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but wait: Star1's V is 15.5, so can both detect. So in that case, any option that includes Star1 would also have a correct star.

Looking again, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

So the correct pairs are B and perhaps D if considering Star1, but Star4 isn't. So only option B has two stars that can be detected by both.

Wait, but what about Star1? It's V=15.5, which is less than 16, so yes for both. So in the options, only option D includes Star1 but also Star4 which can't be detected by HIRES.

Therefore, the correct stars are Star1, Star3, and Star5. But the options don't include a trio. So the only option that includes two correct stars is option B (Star3 and Star5) and perhaps option D (Star1 and Star4, but Star4 isn't). So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because Star1 also meets the criteria. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating Star1's V.

Wait, let me recheck Star1.

Star1: absolute V mag=15.5, distance=10 pc.

Distance modulus is 5 log10(10/10)=0.

So apparent V is 15.5 +0 =15.5. No extinction mentioned, so A_V=0. So the observed V is 15.5. So yes, both can detect it.

So Star1 is a candidate. Looking at the options, which option includes Star1 and another that also meets the condition.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star4's V is 16.74, so can't be detected by HIRES. So option D isn't correct.

So the only option that includes two stars both with V <16 is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star5's V is 15.0, which is also less than 16, so yes.

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 mag to be detectable by both spectrographs.
