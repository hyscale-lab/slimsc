Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's also moving. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative motion and light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Let me think through this step by step.

The setup is a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So, the observer is in the lab frame. I need to find the speed of the light beam as seen by this observer.

Wait, but light always travels at speed c in a vacuum, right? Oh wait, in this case, the light is inside the glass, so its speed is c/n, since the index of refraction slows it down. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass, I think. But what happens when the glass itself is moving?

So, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, it's like the light is moving in the same direction as the medium (glass) is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, the velocity addition formula. But wait, that applies when transforming between different inertial frames. Here, the glass is moving, but I'm not sure if that's the same as considering a frame moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

Wait, the lab is the observer's frame. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So in
