Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds mean I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to think about Einstein's theories. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give possible relative speeds and energies.

First, I think I need to find the relative velocity between the two astronauts. Wait, how do you calculate the relative speed in relativity? I remember that you can't just subtract the velocities because that would sometimes exceed the speed of light, which is impossible. Oh right! The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. Which is approximately 0.14c when rounded. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down between B, C, D. Wait, no, option B is 0.1c. So only C and D are left for the relative speed part.

Next, I need to calculate the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I'll compute each one's energy and sum them.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let's compute gamma for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

v = 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is E1 = gamma * m * c² * 2m? Wait, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is E = gamma * m_total * c². Wait, no, the rest mass is m, so if the astronaut has mass 2m, then E = gamma * (2m) c². Right.
