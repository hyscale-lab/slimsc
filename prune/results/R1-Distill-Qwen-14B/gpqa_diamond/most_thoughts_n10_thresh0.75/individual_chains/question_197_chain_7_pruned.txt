Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X has specific IR and NMR data and reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is a reaction where a ketone is reduced to an alkane. The reagent is usually red phosphorus and HI. So, if the starting material has a ketone group, after the reaction, that ketone would become a methylene (-CH2-) group.

Let me look at the given IR and NMR data for Compound X.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: This is a broad region, probably O-H stretching or an alkyne. But O-H for an acid would be broad and around 2500-3300. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but wait, wait. Also, the region includes the 2500, which is more of C-H stretch for maybe an alkyne or an alkene? Not sure yet.
- 1720 cm-1: This is a strong peak, which typically indicates a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But considering the reaction, if it's a ketone, it will be reduced.
- 1610 cm-1: This is in the range of aromatic C=C stretching.
- 1450 cm-1: Maybe C-O stretching in an ester or something else?

Looking at the 1H NMR data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's really high. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, maybe. Or maybe a carboxylic acid proton, but that's usually a broad peak. Wait, but after Clemmensen, if there's a ketone, maybe the starting material has a ketone. Wait, but if the starting material is a ketone, then the product would be an alkane. So in that case, what would the starting material look like?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The initial compound has a ketone (1720 cm-1) and aromatic protons. So the structure is probably an aromatic ketone.

Looking at the NMR peaks:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's in a different region. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like a phenol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but 10.5 is a bit high for a phenol. Carboxylic acids are usually around 10-12, so maybe that's a possibility. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a peak around 1700, which it does (1720 cm-1). But wait, the IR for a carboxylic acid would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300, and the carbonyl around 1700. So that fits. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but then the reaction is Clemmensen, which is for ketones. So if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, then Clemmensen wouldn't do anything because it's for ketones. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10, so 10.5 might be a bit high, but possible. Then, the IR at 1720 would correspond to a ketone. Wait, no, aldehydes have higher carbonyl frequencies, around 1700-1750. So 1720 is more like a ketone or an aliphatic ester. So maybe the starting material is an aromatic ketone.

But let me look at the NMR again. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two doublets, which would mean a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are in the para positions.

Wait, for example, if it's a 4-substituted benzaldehyde or a para-substituted ketone. Let me think about the substituents. The NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which is typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. For example, in acetophenone derivatives, the protons next to the substituent (like the ketone) would be at higher ppm.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in acetophenone are typically around 7.4-7.8 ppm. So maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a ketone or a nitro group. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent with an electron-donating group.

Wait, the 1H NMR also shows other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Like an ethyl group: CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) could be a CH(CH3)2 group, but wait, no, 1.4 is more like a CH2 group attached to two other CH2 groups. Or perhaps a branching. Wait, the 2.9 ppm multiplet for 1H – maybe a CH that's connected to other groups. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two adjacent CH2 groups.

Putting this together: perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain with a branching. Let me try to imagine the structure.

If the benzene is para-substituted, and the substituent is a group like CH2-C(CH3)2 or something like that. Wait, but the 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 (3H), which is a terminal CH3. So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group would have a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- structure. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would be the CH2CH3 group at the end. The 1.4 ppm doublet is a CH2 connected to a CH. The 1.7 ppm multiplet could be the CH2 next to the CH. The 2.9 ppm is a CH connected to a ketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)R group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group or something else.
