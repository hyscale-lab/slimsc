Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's give it a shot.

The question involves several reactions and NMR analysis. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting (multiplicity) and the integration can give clues about the structure.

So, a triplet (each peak is split into two adjacent peaks) usually means each proton is next to two equivalent protons. Wait, no, wait. The number of splits is one more than the number of neighboring protons. So a triplet (two splits) implies each proton is adjacent to two others. Oh wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think: a singlet has no neighbors, a doublet has one, a triplet two, etc. So if a proton is split into a triplet, it must be next to two equivalent protons. Wait, no, wait, the multiplicity is determined by the neighboring non-equivalent protons. So if two neighboring groups each have a certain number of protons, the splitting can get more complex.

But in this case, the triplet is for 6H. So 6 protons in total, maybe all equivalent. Hmm. So if it's a triplet, perhaps they are the methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. Because, for example, two methyl groups (each with 3H) attached to a central CH2 would give a triplet. Because each CH2 proton is next to two CH3 groups. So each H on CH2 is next to 6 H (from the two CH3 groups). But wait, each group is three H, so each H on CH2 would be next to 3 H from each adjacent CH3, right? So the CH2 would have a triplet because each of its H is split by two neighboring CH3 groups? Or wait, each CH2 H is adjacent to 6 H? No, that can't be right. Because each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two CH3 groups, each with three H. But wait, each H on the CH2 would see each H on the adjacent CH3 as non-equivalent? Or are they equivalent?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Think about the NMR of an ethyl group. A CH2CH3 group. The CH2 would be a quartet because each H on the CH2 is next to 3 H from the CH3. Wait, noâ€”the CH2 is next to the CH3. So the CH2 would split into a quartet (n+1 where n=3), giving a quartet. The
