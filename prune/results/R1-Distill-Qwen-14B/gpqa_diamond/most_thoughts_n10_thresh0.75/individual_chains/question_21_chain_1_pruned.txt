Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomersâ€”specifically, constitutional and stereoisomers. Then it asks about two compounds and their properties regarding tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different forms by the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds. Optical isomerism, on the other hand, refers to compounds that have chiral centers, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it might exhibit optical isomerism.

The problem is divided into two parts: (A) and (B). Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

The compounds given are:
- Benzoquinone
- Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione
- Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
- Dimethyl fumarate

Wait, actually, I think I might have misread. The first part says "Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)." So for part A, the options are between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Then part B is about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, deciding which shows optical isomerism.

Let me tackle part A first. Do either of these compounds exhibit tautomerism?

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone structure with two ketone groups. Quinones are typically good at resonance and can sometimes tautomerize. Wait, but tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen and a shift in double bonds. For example, in diketones, like o-quinone, can they tautomerize? Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring, but since it's a quinone, it's conjugated. Can it undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

Wait, another thought: tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a diketone, if the two carbonyls are on adjacent carbons, maybe there's a possibility. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Let me imagine the structure. Oh, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. But wait, the ring is fully conjugated, so are there any alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism?

Wait, benzoquinone (like 1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups opposite each other on the ring. Each of those carbonyl groups is attached to the benzene. Do those carbons have any hydrogens attached? No, because each is a carbonyl group, so they're double-bonded to oxygen. So there's no alpha hydrogen for keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism.

What about cyclohex
