Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about reacting an epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and they typically open epoxides in a specific way. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound in question is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure mentally. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane... so that's a norbornane structure, right? Norbornane is two cyclopropane rings connected. So 7-oxa means there's an oxygen in place of a carbon, making it an epoxide ring.

In this structure, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 4. So the 1R, 3R, 4R â€“ all methyl groups? And the 6S position is the oxygen. So the epoxide ring is between carbons 6 and 7? Wait, maybe I should imagine the structure as a bicyclo with the oxygen in one bridge.

When this reacts with Me2CuLi, which is a methyl cuprate, it's a strong nucleophile. I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates, the nucleophile (the methyl group here) adds to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. But wait, in the case
