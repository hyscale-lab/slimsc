Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me try to work through each compound one by one. 

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has a chiral center, and it's not meso or part of a plane of symmetry. So, I need to check each compound for these factors.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many are optically active. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, okay, this is a chlorinated alkene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. But-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Alternatively, maybe CH2Cl is attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe the substituents are on each end. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here at position 1, so the structure is Cl-C double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, actually, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl). So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace a H on C1. So C1 is Cl, attached to a double bond to C2, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, butane is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but 2-methyl would be on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No,
