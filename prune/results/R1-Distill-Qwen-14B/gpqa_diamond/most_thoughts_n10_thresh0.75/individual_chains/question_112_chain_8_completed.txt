Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

Alright, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So, the first step is probably to normalize this state because it's stated to be proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right, the state is proportional, so I need to find the normalization constant. The general form is |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a is (1+i) and b is (2 - i). The norm is |a|² + |b|². Let's compute that.

Calculating |a|²: (1+i)(1-i)/1 (since the complex conjugate of a is (1-i)). So (1 +1) = 2.

|b|²: (2 -i)(2 +i) = (4 + 2i -2i +1) = 5. So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i != j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what kind of operator is that? Let me think. The basis here is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of S_z. So the operator's matrix in this basis would be a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

Matrix elements: 
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1),
A_12 = hbar/2,
A_21 = hbar/2,
A_22 = 0.

So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. That's a spin operator in the x-direction, perhaps? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the spin operator S_x is (ħ/2) times that. So yes, this operator A is the S_x operator.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of S_x, which are |+x> and |-x>, right? So the problem is asking for the probability that a measurement of A (which is S_x) yields each eigenvalue, which are ± ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalues of S_x are ± ħ/2. So when we measure A, the possible outcomes are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But the question says, "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". Hmm, wait, no. The eigenstates are the possible states after measurement. But the probabilities would correspond to the eigenvalues. So I need to find the probabilities of getting +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when measuring A.

Wait, but the operator A is S_x, so the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are the squared modulus of the projections onto these states.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is the S_x basis, and then the probabilities are the square moduli of the coefficients in that basis.

So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> states.

But wait, what's the |+x> and |-x> states in terms of |up> and |down>?

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me check that. Yes, for spin-½ particles, the eigenstates of S_x are superpositions of up and down in that way.

So, to express |alpha> in the S_x basis, I can write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Alternatively, I can express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x> and find the coefficients.

So let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

Each |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
Each |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, solving for |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

Substitute these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 - i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))] [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expanding this:

= [1/(sqrt(14))] [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))| -x> ]

Simplify the coefficients:

For |+x>: (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3
For |-x>: (1 + i -2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)

So:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, wait wait. Let me recheck that. Let me compute the coefficients again.

Wait, inside the brackets:

(1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) → (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>
(2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) → (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

So adding these together:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |-x>

So for |+x>:

(1 + i + 2 - i) = 3 → coefficient is 3.

For |-x>:

(1 + i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i → coefficient is (-1 + 2i).

So yes, the coefficients are 3 and (-1 + 2i).

So |alpha> is:

[3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, but sqrt(14) comes from sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14). Right?

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) for |+x> and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) for |-x>.

Now, the probabilities are the square of the moduli of these coefficients.

Compute |3/sqrt(14)|² → 9/14.

Compute | (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) |² → | (-1)^2 + (2)^2 | / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, but that sums to (9 +5)/14 =14/14 =1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.642857 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to these numbers. So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is ~0.64, and 5/14 is ~0.357, which rounds to 0.36 in option A.

So the probabilities would be 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value <A> is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is the S_x operator, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the state |alpha> has components in |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value would be the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So:

<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)
= [ (9/14 -5/14) ] (ħ/2 )
= (4/14)( ħ/2 )
= (2/7) (ħ/2 )
= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Wait, but let me compute it directly for cross-checking.

Alternatively, I can compute <A> using the matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the vector in the z-basis is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

So <A> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

Let me write |alpha> as a column vector:

[ (1+i)/√7 ]
[ (2 -i)/√7 ]

The conjugate transpose is:

[ (1-i)/√7   (2 +i)/√7 ]

Multiply A into this:

First, multiply the conjugate transpose by A:

= [ (1-i)/√7   (2 +i)/√7 ] * [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Calculating the product:

First element (1,1): (1-i)(0) + (2+i)(ħ/2) = (2+i)(ħ/2)
First element (1,2): (1-i)(ħ/2) + (2+i)(0) = (1-i)(ħ/2)

Wait, but actually, this is the product of a 1x2 matrix and a 2x2 matrix, which results in a 1x2 matrix.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the expectation value is (alpha^†) A (alpha). So (alpha^†) is 1x2, A is 2x2, so multiply them to get a 1x2 matrix, then multiply by alpha (2x1) to get a scalar.

So the calculation:

(alpha^†) A = [ (1-i)/√7 , (2+i)/√7 ] * A 

Which is:

= [ ( (1-i)*0 + (2+i)*(ħ/2) ), ( (1-i)*(ħ/2) + (2+i)*0 ) ]

= [ (2+i) (ħ/2) / √7 , (1-i) (ħ/2) / √7 ]

Then, multiply this by alpha, which is [ (1+i)/√7 ; (2-i)/√7 ]

So the scalar is:

[ (2+i)(ħ/2) / √7 ] * (1+i)/√7 + [ (1-i)(ħ/2)/√7 ] * (2-i)/√7

Factor out (ħ/2) / (7):

= (ħ/2) [ (2+i)(1+i) + (1-i)(2-i) ] /7

Compute each term:

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i + i*1 + i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

(1-i)(2-i) = 2 -i -2i +i² = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Add them together: (1 +3i) + (1 -3i) = 2.

So the expectation becomes (ħ/2) * 2 /7 = ħ/(7).

So that's consistent with the earlier calculation. The average is ħ/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That matches.

Option B average is 3ħ/sqrt(7), which is about 3*1.732=5.196 ħ, but our average is ħ/7, which is about 0.1428 ħ. So option B is wrong.

Option C average is ħ/sqrt(7) ≈ 0.377, which is larger than our result.

Option D average is 2ħ/sqrt(7) ≈ 0.755, which is way bigger.

So option A is the correct one.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant is determined by calculating the norm of the state:

\[
|a|^2 = |1+i|^2 = 2, \quad |b|^2 = |2-i|^2 = 5, \quad \text{total norm} = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the spin-\( x \) operator \( S_x \), which has eigenstates \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) basis. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

The probabilities are the squared moduli of the coefficients:

\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
