Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? Hmm, I remember something about special relativity from physics class. So, the spacecraft is moving at a very high speed, close to the speed of light, which means time dilation effects must come into play.

The scenario: Aliens from the Large Magellanic Cloud are sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c). The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are A to D, with some suggesting the astronaut dies before arrival, others giving specific years.

Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 Earth years. So, from Earth's frame of reference, the astronaut would be 22 plus the time it takes, but if the trip time is too long, the astronaut might not survive. But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, less time would pass. So, I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I should find the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, the problem probably assumes it's the same as the approximate distance, but maybe I can find that. Wait, I remember the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me confirm that. Yeah, about 163,000 light-years.

So, the
