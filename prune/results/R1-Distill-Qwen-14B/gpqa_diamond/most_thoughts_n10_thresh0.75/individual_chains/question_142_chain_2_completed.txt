Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Let me think. The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think when a density matrix is a mixture of the basis states with equal probabilities, it's a maximally mixed state. Oh right, for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. So ρ here is (I/2), because |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere, similarly |1><1| has 1 at (1,1). Adding them and dividing by 2 would give 0.5 at the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

Now, qubit space is often represented as a Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r describes the state in this sphere. For a pure state |ψ><ψ|, the Bloch vector points to the state's position on the sphere. But for mixed states, the Bloch representation is a bit different. I recall that the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I have that, then I can compare it to the given ρ. Let's see. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| in terms of the Pauli matrices. Wait, |0> is (1,0), and |1> is (0,1). So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then ρ becomes I/2.

So comparing this to the general form, I = I + r·σ. Wait, no, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. Oh wait, the given ρ is (I/2), so that would mean I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. Multiplying both sides by 2, I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides, 0 = r·σ. That implies that r must be the zero vector because any non-zero r would contribute. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which corresponds to the identity matrix scaled by \( \frac{1}{2} \), i.e., \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \). In the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the Bloch vector and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \( \rho = \frac{I}{2} \), it follows that \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must be the zero vector, \( \mathbf{r} = (0,0,0) \), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \( z \)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, \( r = (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
