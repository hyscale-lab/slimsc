Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. The question gives a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, so each term is |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2. Oh right, because when you add them together, you get a matrix that's a sum of the projectors for |0> and |1>, each scaled by 1/2. So this should represent a mixed state where the qubit is in state |0> with probability 1/2 and |1> with probability 1/2. That makes sense because the diagonal entries would be 1/2 each, and the off-diagonal entries zero.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think qubit space is usually represented as a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize the state of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r is just the vector (x,y,z) corresponding to the coefficients in the state's representation.

Wait, but here we have a density matrix. How does that translate to the Bloch vector? I recall that for a density matrix ρ, it can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x,y,z).

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find the components of r. Let's compute this. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write out the matrices. |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then ρ is I/2.

Wait, but wait a second. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So in this case, ρ = I/2 would mean that (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r·σ = 0. So what does that tell me about r?

The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. If this equals zero matrix, each component must be zero. So each r_x, r_y, r_z must be zero. So r would be (0,0,0). Because any non-zero component would contribute a non-zero matrix element.

Wait, but let me check. If r is zero, then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2. Which matches the given ρ. So yes, the Bloch vector is at the origin. That's the completely mixed state. Because when you have a maximally mixed state, it's the same as the density matrix I/2, which is the case here.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct choice.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me think again. The density matrix for a mixed state of |0> and |1> with equal probabilities is indeed (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Which is the same as the maximally mixed state. The maximally mixed state is I/2, which has no Bloch vector, so r is (0,0,0). So yes, option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in state \(|0\rangle\) with probability \(1/2\) and \(|1\rangle\) with probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
