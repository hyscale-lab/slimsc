Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let's see what I can figure out here.

The problem says that the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right, λ is a coupling constant, and f and ψ_f are the fermion fields interacting with the boson X. So the term looks like it's an interaction between the boson X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, kinematically allowed decays mean that the decay products must have enough energy, right? The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to 3 GeV each (since each particle in a pair would need to have mass less than X's mass divided by 2). Because in a decay into two particles, each would need to have a rest mass less than or equal to half of X's mass. If the rest mass is higher, they can't be produced because you can't have a particle with rest mass higher than half the parent's rest mass when you split into two.

Wait, but wait, for fermions, each must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me remember the masses of the known fermions. The up and down quarks are the lightest, their masses are around a few MeV, so way less than 3 GeV. The strange quark is about 100 MeV, also fine. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. The bottom quark is around 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. The top quark is way heavier at around 173 GeV, so that's way over. Similarly, the electron is about 0.5 MeV, muon is 105 MeV, tau around 1.78 GeV. The charged leptons (like mu, tau) have their masses, but the neutrinos are negligible, but I don't think they're considered here.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the decay of the boson X into fermion-antifermion pairs. So each pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. For each fermion species, the sum would be twice the mass. So, for each fermion pair, 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV → m_fermion ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV?

Looking at the standard model particles:

- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV → way under.
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV → under.
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV → under.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV → under.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV → over 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b and bbar.
- Top quark (t): way over, so no.
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV → yes.
- Muon (mu): ~105 MeV → yes.
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV → under 3 GeV. So yes.
- Neutrinos are negligible, but I don't think they're considered here because the interaction given is between X and fermions, but for decay into neutrinos, the coupling might be different.

Wait, but the interaction Lagrangian given is written as involving ψ_f, so perhaps the fermions in the decay are the ones that interact with X. So the decay of X would be into any of the fermion-antifermion pairs that have mass less than 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions would be u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait, for the quarks, their masses are as I said. But when considering decay into quarks, the problem is that quarks can't be observed directly because they're confined. So in reality, a boson can't decay directly into quarks because we can't observe the quarks; instead, they would form hadrons. However, in terms of kinematic possibility, the question is about whether the decay is allowed. So, the decay into quarks is kinematically allowed, but perhaps the interaction is only with certain fermions.

Wait, but the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, regardless of whether they can be directly observed. So for the purpose of this question, perhaps all the fermion pairs that have a rest mass less than or equal to 3 GeV are allowed.

So, the possible fermions for decay would include u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. But wait, what about bottom quarks? Their mass is about 4.7 GeV, so 4.7*2=9.4 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and bbar because each would require 4.7 GeV, and X only has 6 GeV. So the decay into b bbar is not allowed.

So now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But since b is 4.7 GeV, each would require 4.7 GeV, so sum is 9.4, which is more than 6 GeV. So that's impossible. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So c is 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV. So two c's would be 3 GeV, which is exactly allowed. So yes, c cbar is allowed. tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait, no, because X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into two taus: each tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. 3.56 <6 GeV. So yes, because the total is 3.56, which is less than 6. So tau pair is allowed. Similarly, muons are 0.105 GeV each, so 2*0.105=0.21 GeV which is fine.

So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's possible.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. But top quark is about 173 GeV. Each t is 173, so two would be 346, which is way more than 6. So decay into t tbar is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. But as before, b is 4.7 GeV, so 2 *4.7=9.4 GeV>6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is impossible. So Option D is incorrect.

So among the options, only option B has all possible decay channels that are allowed. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tau part. Tau is 1.78 GeV. 2 *1.78=3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV. So 3.56 <6, so yes, the decay X→ tau+ tau- is allowed. Similarly, for muon pair, 2*0.105=0.21 <6.

Ah, but wait, in the interaction, the term is (v + X(y)), so perhaps that's a Yukawa coupling term. But whether the fermion can decay depends on whether their mass is less than X's mass. But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion with mass less than 6 GeV can be produced in pairs as long as 2m_f < 6 GeV. So m_f <3 GeV.

So, for each fermion, if m_f <3 GeV, then the pair can be produced.

So for the quark content:

u: ~2.2 MeV → yes.

d: ~4.7 MeV → yes.

s: ~95 MeV → yes.

c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
