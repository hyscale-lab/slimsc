Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about why certain peaks disappear when using PFA+DSG fixation instead of regular PFA. The experiment was done on human B cells using an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor. So, I remember that in ChIP-seq, the peaks represent regions of the genome where the transcription factor binds.

Wait, I think that PFA is a type of crosslinker. PFA stands for paraformaldehyde. It's commonly used in fixation because it formaldehyde can crosslink proteins to DNA. But wait, when you use PFA, sometimes you add other agents too. Oh right, DSG is another crosslinker. DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide with glutaraldehyde. It's a stronger crosslinker, I think. So, using PFA+DSG together might lead to more efficient crosslinking of proteins to DNA.

So in the experiment, when they used PFA alone, they got peaks, but when they switched to PFA+DSG, those peaks disappeared. Hmm, that's interesting. Why would that happen?

I remember that crosslinking can affect the efficiency of ChIP. If the crosslinking is too strong, maybe it's harder to shear the DNA and pull down the protein-DNA complexes. But wait, no, in this case, the peaks disappeared, so maybe the crosslinking with DSG
