Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the question. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are spectrographs used on large telescopes. The question is about which stars are bright enough to be observed by both. The key is to find stars that are within the brightness limits of both instruments.

The question provides some data about each star—like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects their apparent brightness. I remember that apparent magnitude is what matters for observation because it's how bright the star appears from Earth.

The information given says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So anything with V mag ≤17? Wait, wait. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if the limit is "brighter than 17 mag", that means stars with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be observed. Because, for example, a V mag of 17 would be the limit. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So their limit is V mag ≤16. So a star must have V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 to be detectable by both, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so the stricter limit is 16. So any star with V mag ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait but wait: the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star needs to be observable by both. So the apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So the stricter condition is ≤16. So only stars with apparent V mag ≤16 can be detected by both. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (like 17), ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So only stars with V ≤16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but I need to check each star's apparent V magnitude,
