Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember from the question that each spectrograph has different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16.5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16, meaning apparent V mag <=16. So a star must have apparent magnitude <=16 to be detected by both? Or wait, no. Wait, because if a star is brighter than 16 (apparent V mag less than 16 for HIRES), and brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO, then the more restrictive is 16, so a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be seen by both. Or wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's less than 17. But wait, the apparent magnitude is a bit confusing here. Because lower numbers are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, the limit is apparent V mag brighter than 17, which is <=17. So any star with apparent V <=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. For HIRES, brighter than 16, so apparent V <=16.

So, a star must have apparent V magnitude <=16 to be detected by both. Because if it's <=16, it's within both limits. So the star must have apparent V <=16.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is absolute V + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d) -5. So d=10, log(10)=1, 5*1-5=0. So apparent V is 15.5 +0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Which is <=16, so it's brighter than 16.5? Wait, wait,
