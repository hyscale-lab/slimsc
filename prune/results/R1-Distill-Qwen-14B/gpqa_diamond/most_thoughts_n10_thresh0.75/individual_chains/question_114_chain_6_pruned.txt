Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that in the presence of a nitrile group, ketones can undergo some kind of substitution. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in acidic conditions.

So, for cyanohydrin formation, the ketone attacks the nitrile. But wait, I think the mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl oxygen on the nitrile carbon, but that might require some acid catalysis. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction would need an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group or activating it for the attack.

So for the first reaction, A should be an acid like H3O+ (which is H+ in solution). Let's look at the options. Options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I think is sodium bisulfite. Wait, sodium bisulfite is used in other reactions, like maybe for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but in this case, it's more likely an acid catalyst. So maybe A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It's reacting with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid? How does that happen? Oh right, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The conditions usually involve strong acid or base and heat, or possibly a two-step process.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a cyanohydrin (since it's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon). So when you have a n
