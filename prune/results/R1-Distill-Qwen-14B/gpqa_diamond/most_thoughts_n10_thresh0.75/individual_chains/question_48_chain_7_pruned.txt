Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let's break it down step by step. 

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so its structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone group (a carbonyl). The first step is treating it with bromine. Bromine (Br2) in a certain solvent, probably something like water or maybe another polar aprotic solvent. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, so when it reacts with bromine, I think it's a halohydrin formation or maybe an addition. Alternatively, I recall that ketones can undergo some kind of addition with bromine, but wait, wait. Oh right! When a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably a halogenation via an enol. But wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, wait, dihydroxylation is with something like osmium tetroxide. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh, right! When ketones are treated with bromine, it's typically a bromohydrin formation. Alternatively, maybe a conjugate addition. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding bromine would probably lead to a dibromide. Or wait, maybe it's a bromonium ion ring opening. Oh, wait, no. Oh, another thought: in the presence of a base
