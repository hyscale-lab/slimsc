Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production is based on the proton-proton chain, which has several branches. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches... I think the pp-III is the main one, contributing most of the energy. So if that stops, what happens to the neutrino flux?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton cycle. The main branches produce different types of neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the dominant one for producing high-energy neutrinos, like the ones we're talking about hereâ€”700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. These are probably from the Beryllium-7 neutrinos, the ones involved in the higher energy steps.

Wait, the neutrinos take about 8 minutes to reach Earth, so the pp-III branch stopping 8.5 minutes ago means that the effect on the neutrino flux would be observed now, right? Because the neutrinos from the Sun's core take that time to travel here.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what's the effect on the neutrino production? I think the pp-III branch is responsible for the majority of the high-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos would drop significantly.

In the question, we're looking at two bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900 keV. If the pp-III is the main source for these higher energies, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces the highest energy neutrinos. So, the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would be more affected than the 700-800 keV band (band 1). So the flux in band 2 would drop more, making the ratio (flux 1/flux 2) increase.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the lower band is from a
