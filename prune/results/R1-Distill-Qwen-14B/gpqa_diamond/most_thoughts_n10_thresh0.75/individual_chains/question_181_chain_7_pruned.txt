Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. I'm supposed to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux1/flux2 is what we're looking for.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch again? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches. The pp-I branch probably involves reactions without any heavier isotopes. The pp-II and pp-III involve different steps, maybe with beryllium or something. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the 7Be isotope. Let me think: in the pp-III branch, protons combine to make 7Be, which then captures a proton to form 8B, which quickly decays into two positrons and a 2 neutrons, or something like that. Oh wait, no, the decay of 8B emits positrons and neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun mainly through the decay of 8B, right? And that's part of the pp-III branch. So if pp-III stops, then the production of those neutrinos stops. But for how long? The question says it stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The Sun's light travel time is about 8 minutes, right? So if the pp-III stops, the effect on the neutrino flux would take 8.5 minutes to reach Earth. So after that time, the neutrinos from that source would stop. But wait, if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process would stop, but other processes continue.

So neutrinos come from different sources. The main ones are the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle, I think. But wait, for solar neutrinos, the dominant source is the pp-III branch, which produces 8B, which decays into positrons and neutrinos. The CNO cycle produces fewer neutrinos, I think. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux would drop, but how much?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two energy bands. So the neutrino energies are determined by the decay process. The 8B decay emits neutrinos with a certain energy. Do I remember the typical neutrino energies from 8B decay?

I think the 8B decay emits neutrinos with energies around 400 keV to maybe 800 keV or so. So if the pp-III branch stops, the neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) would be affected. But wait, if the pp-III is stopped, that particular source of neutrinos is gone. So the flux in those bands would drop, but what's the relative contribution of pp-III to each band?
