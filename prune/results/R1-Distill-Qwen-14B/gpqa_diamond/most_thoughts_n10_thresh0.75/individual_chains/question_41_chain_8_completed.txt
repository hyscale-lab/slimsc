Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a light beam propagating through glass moving at a constant velocity. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially involving light, things get a bit tricky. I think this has to do with the principles of special relativity, specifically the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory. Because light speed is involved, Newtonian mechanics might not be enough here.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n, assuming the glass has an index of refraction n. But wait, wait! I think the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity addition formula because the glass is moving. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/c²), right? But wait, no, I might be mixing up the formula. Let me recall: if an object is moving at speed u in a frame S, and the frame S itself is moving at speed v relative to another frame S', then the speed in S' is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²), assuming they're moving along the same line.

Wait, no, wait. The formula I know is if frame S is moving at speed v relative to S', and an object is moving at u in S, then from S', the speed is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it the other way around? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Suppose the frame S is moving at velocity v relative to S'. If in S, an object has velocity u, then in S', it's (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)) if the motion is along the same direction.

Wait, no. I think I got it wrong. The correct formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)). But wait, in which scenario? Let's say S is the lab frame, and S' is moving at speed v relative to S. If in S', the light has speed u' = c/n, then in S, the speed would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)). Because S' is moving at v relative to S.

Wait, no, sorry. If S' is moving at speed v relative to S, then an observer in S will see the object moving at u, which is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c²)). So in this case, the light's speed in S' (the glass frame) is u' = c/n (since in the glass, light moves at c/n). The glass is moving at speed v towards the observer in the lab. So to find the speed in the lab frame (S), we plug into the formula.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So the beam is propagating through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So the beam's direction is towards the observer as well, so the velocity vectors are in the same direction. So when we apply the velocity addition, the signs matter.

So let me clarify. Let's define the direction: the lab is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, same as the beam's direction. So from the glass's frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction (since the light is moving through the glass towards the observer, which is moving towards the light, perhaps? Wait, no, in the glass's frame, the light would be moving at c/n in the direction of the beam. So when the glass is moving towards the lab, the lab observes the light speed.

So in S' (glass frame), the light's speed is u' = c/n. The glass is moving at v relative to S (lab), so we need to find u (light's speed in S). Using the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²).

Plugging in u' = c/n, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)) [since (c/n)*v = v/(n) multiplied by 1/c²]

So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c)

The numerator is (c + n v)/n.

So putting it all together:

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel out, so:

u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but c is 1 in the problem statement. So c=1, so this becomes:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but wait a second. Because the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So when the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed as observed in the lab would be higher than c/n? That doesn't make sense because in any inertial frame, light speed is c. Wait, no, because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So what's wrong here?

Wait a minute, I must have made a mistake. Because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But in this problem, the light is moving through a medium (glass), so its speed is not c. Oh, wait, but the medium is moving. So perhaps the speed of light in the medium is affected by the velocity of the medium?

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties, regardless of the medium's motion. Because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But according to relativity, when you switch frames, the speed of light must remain c. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The problem is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. But according to special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So the speed of the light in the lab frame should be c, regardless of the glass's motion. But the options don't include c as an option. Wait, looking at the options: option B is 1, which is c. So perhaps the correct answer is B) 1.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The question says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So the glass is moving, but the light is in the glass. So in the lab frame, the light is moving through the moving glass. So according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame must be c, irrespective of the medium's motion. Because in any inertial frame, light speed is measured as c.

So the correct answer should be option B) 1.

Wait, but why is the glass's velocity v given then? Because if the light's speed is c regardless of the glass's motion, then the velocity v of the glass doesn't affect the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the speed of the light as observed in the lab, considering the glass's motion, but not in a vacuum. Hmm, but according to the theory, the speed of light in a medium is not affected by the frame's motion in the same way. Wait, but the medium itself is moving. So perhaps this is a scenario where the medium's velocity influences the observed speed of light within it. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass at speed c/n in the glass's frame. So according to the lab, what's the speed? Using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but this is a property of the medium. So regardless of the medium's velocity, the speed of light in the medium remains c/n in the medium's frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the lab's measurement of the light's speed?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. The light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So applying the velocity addition formula: u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where u' is the speed in the glass frame, which is c/n.

But wait, the correct formula when adding velocities is:

If frame S' is moving at speed v relative to S, and an object has speed u' in S', then in S, the object's speed is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

So substituting u' = c/n:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v )/(n c )

In the numerator: (c + n v)/n

Denominator: [n c + v ]/(n c )

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Since c=1, this becomes (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but that's one of the options. Option A is (1 +n v )/(n + v ), option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v ), and option D is (1-nv)/(n +v ). So option A would be the result if we apply the velocity addition formula.

But wait, according to special relativity, the speed of light should always be c. So why is this calculation giving a different result?

Ah, perhaps because the light is in a medium that's moving. Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a medium is not c if the medium is moving. Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is always measured as c in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving relative to another frame, the speed of light as observed in that frame would change?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. On one hand, the velocity addition formula gives option A, but on the other hand, according to relativity, the speed of light should be c.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. The velocity addition formula applies to objects, not to light. Because for light, the speed doesn't change; it's always c in any inertial frame.

Wait, that must be the case. So regardless of the glass's velocity, the speed of light in the lab frame is c=1. So the correct answer is B.

But why is the application of the velocity addition formula giving a different result? Because the velocity addition formula is for objects with velocities less than c. For light, which always travels at c, the formula would not apply in the same way because substituting u' = c into the formula would lead to division by zero, and thus the speed remains c.

Ah, I see. So when the object is light (u' = c), the velocity addition would correctly give u = c, because substituting u' = c into the formula:

u = (c + v) / (1 + (c v)/c² ) = (c + v) / (1 + v/c ) = [ (c + v) ] / [ (c + v)/c ) ] = c.

Yes, that makes sense. So even if the medium is moving, the observed speed of light would remain c. So in this problem, the correct answer is B) 1.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must consider the principles of special relativity. The speed of light in a vacuum is always \( c = 1 \), and this holds true in any inertial reference frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the medium. However, the problem involves a light beam propagating through a medium (glass) with an index of refraction \( n \), which is itself moving at a constant velocity \( v \) relative to the laboratory.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \). To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we would typically use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' \) is the speed of light in the glass's frame (\( c/n \)) and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula gives:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

and the numerator:

\[
\frac{c + n v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
u = \frac{c (c + n v)}{n c + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) in the problem, this reduces to:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. However, according to the principles of special relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame, including the laboratory frame, is always \( c = 1 \). The velocity addition formula applies to objects with velocities less than \( c \), but for light, the speed remains \( c \) regardless of the motion of the medium. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\text{Speed of light in the laboratory frame} = 1
\]

This corresponds to option B. The inclusion of \( v \) in the problem is a red herring, as it does not affect the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame.

Answer: B
