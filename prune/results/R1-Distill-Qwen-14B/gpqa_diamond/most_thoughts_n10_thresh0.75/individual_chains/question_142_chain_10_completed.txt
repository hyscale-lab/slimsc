Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Let me write down the given density matrix first. It's ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that the density matrix for a pure state is just the outer product of the state with itself. But here, it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So this must be a mixed state because the matrix has these two terms added together and scaled by 1/2. 

Right, the general form for a density matrix of a mixed state with equal probabilities for two states would be ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|. In this case, p is 1/2, so it's a 50-50 mixture. That makes sense because the density matrix is a convex combination of the projectors onto |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think when you have a qubit state, the density matrix can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space. This space uses the Bloch sphere representation. Each pure state is a point on the surface of a unit sphere, and mixed states are inside the sphere.

The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a density matrix ρ, the corresponding Bloch vector r = (x, y, z) is determined by the coefficients in ρ. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix. So, to find r, I need to express ρ in terms of this equation.

Let me expand the given ρ. 

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute each term. |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2)(I), where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ = (I)/2. Let me see if this matches the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So when I set the two expressions equal, I get:

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Subtracting (I)/2 from both sides, we get 0 = r·σ. That means the vector r must be zero because σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

So r = (0,0,0). That would correspond to the origin in the Bloch sphere. Wait, but wait, the origin is the completely mixed state. Yes, because a completely mixed state can't be represented on the surface of the Bloch sphere—it's at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches what I derived. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

I should double-check my steps. The density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's (I)/2, which when plugged into the Bloch vector equation, gives r as zero. So yes, the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, as it is a convex combination of the projectors onto the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), with equal probabilities (50-50 mixture). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \(\rho\) into this equation:

\[
\frac{I}{2} = \frac{I + r \cdot \sigma}{2}.
\]

Subtracting \(\frac{I}{2}\) from both sides gives \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), which implies that the Bloch vector \(r\) must be zero. This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
