Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula comes into play. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, actually, if one object is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the first would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), but wait, wait. Let me think. Suppose astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction. From A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, actually, in the problem, I think the relative speed is from one astronaut's frame to the other. So for example, if astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, and astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let's compute that.

Wait wait no, wait. Wait, no. If astronaut A is moving at velocity u = 0.6c relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c relative to the lab frame, then from A's frame, B's velocity is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Because from A's perspective, they are stationary, and B is moving at (v - u) / (1 - vu/c²).

Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, their relative velocity isn't just 0.1c. Because of the relativity, the denominator will affect it. Let me compute this.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So (v - u) is -0.1c. Then denominator is
