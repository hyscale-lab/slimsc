Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So, the setup: a glass with index of refraction n is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass itself is moving toward the observer in the lab. Oh wait, the direction is the same as the beam, so if the beam is moving towards the observer, the glass is moving towards the observer too. Or wait, maybe not. Let me read it again.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. Oh, same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. So if the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, that would mean the glass is moving faster towards the observer than the light is? Or wait, no, because the beam is in the glass. Hmm, this might get confusing.

Wait, no. The beam is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving. So, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So, from the lab frame, the beam's speed is what? Well, in the glass, the speed of light is c/n, but since the glass is moving, we need to apply some sort of velocity addition, perhaps relativistic or classical.

But wait, I remember that in relativity, you can't just add velocities in a classical way. However, considering
