Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the operator is P, and I'm supposed to find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane, which probably means the vector n is in the x-z plane, so the angle theta would be with the z-axis, and phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, phi is the azimuthal angle, so if it's in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or maybe pi, but for now, maybe I can consider it as along some direction in x-z.

So the operator is probably the angular momentum operator, since the components are given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. Oh wait, muons are leptons, so their spin is 1/2.

The general form of the angular momentum operator is P = ħ/2 times the Pauli vector dotted with the direction vector n. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since the direction n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

But wait, the eigenvector is along the direction n. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of P in the direction n.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the operator P squared. Since P² should give (ħ²/4)(σ_x^2 + σ_y^2 + σ_z^2), but since sigma_x squared is identity matrix, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So P² is (ħ²/4)(3I), because each Pauli matrix squared is I. So P² |v> = (3ħ²/4) |v>, which makes sense because the eigenvalues of P should be ±ħ/
