Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so mu = gamma*S_z. When the field is off, the system is in a state of no external influence? Or wait, no, the first field is turned off and the new field is turned on. So the system's environment changes.

So, the particle's spin is subject to a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B. Oh right, because the energy is proportional to the dot product. So initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu_z B, which is proportional to S_z.

Now, when the magnetic field is switched from +Z to +Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B_new, where B_new is along +Y. So mu is gamma S, so mu_y is gamma S_y. Therefore, H_final becomes -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z initially. Oh wait, no. Because the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, wait that's interesting. Because normally, the magnetic moment of a spin is given by mu = gamma S, a vector. But in this problem, mu is given as gamma S_z, so it's only in the z-direction. So perhaps the magnetic moment is aligned along the same direction as the field, which was along +Z. So when the field is along +Y, mu is still in the z-direction? Or maybe mu is now aligned with the new field direction?

Wait, wait. No, mu is given as gamma S_z. So it's fixed in the z-direction, regardless of the field direction. So when the field is along +Y, the magnetic moment is still along +Z. Hmm, that's a bit
