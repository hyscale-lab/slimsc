Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, I remember that the S/N depends on the brightness of the star, which relates to its magnitude.

First, I should probably recall what the ESPRESSO spectrograph's capabilities are. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph designed for the VLT. It has a high efficiency, I think, and can achieve high S/N ratios for bright stars. But for fainter stars, the S/N might drop below the required threshold, especially over a one-hour exposure.

Wait, the question gives each star's absolute V magnitude and distance. Absolute magnitude (M) is the brightness a star would have at 10 parsecs away. So I can calculate their apparent magnitudes (m) using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me calculate each option:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Checking my memory, Canopus is a prominent star in the southern sky and is one of the brightest. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7 or so. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think: Sirius is about -1.5, Canopus is next. So maybe Canopus is around magnitude 0.5? Or wait, perhaps it's even brighter. Alternatively, maybe I should look it up but since I can't, I'll proceed. Let's say Canopus is bright, so m is low (negative or small positive).

Wait, another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance is such that it can detect stars down to a certain apparent magnitude. The ESPRESSO instrument is designed to reach high precision, so maybe it can handle bright stars but maybe not very faint ones. Wait, I think that the ESPRESSO has a certain range, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps each star's m (apparent magnitude) will determine if the S/N is enough.

So, the key is to compute the apparent magnitude for each star and then see if ESPRESSO can achieve S/N >=10
