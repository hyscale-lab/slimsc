Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because I thought qubits are two-level systems, so maybe represented in a Bloch sphere or something.

Let me start by recalling what a density matrix is. A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, whether it's pure or mixed. For a qubit, a pure state can be written as a density matrix like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But this ρ looks a bit different. Let me write it out:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

Hmm, wait a second. That's not the standard basis states I'm used to. Or wait, maybe it is. Let me think. The standard basis states for a qubit are |0⟩ and |1⟩, so the density matrix is an equal mixture of these two states. So this would be a completely mixed state, right? Because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) divided by 2, which is the same as saying each state has probability 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of a single qubit, the density matrix for a completely mixed state is I/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let me compute that. The identity matrix for a 2x2 system is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So I/2 would be [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So that's exactly what ρ is here.

So, ρ is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. What does that mean? Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation. A qubit can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere, with the coordinates corresponding to the components of the qubit state.

Wait, but the Bloch sphere is for pure states. For mixed states, like this one, which is a completely mixed state, how is it represented? I think for mixed states, the density matrix can't be represented as a single point on the Bloch sphere. Instead, the expectation values are considered, but for a completely mixed state, the expectation values would be zero because it's an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Wait, the Bloch vector in the Bloch sphere is given by the expectation values. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me compute that.

So for our ρ, which is I/2, that would mean (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides, we get r·σ = 0. So all the components of r must be zero because the only way r·σ = 0 is when r is the zero vector. So the Bloch vector r would be (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but the options given are
