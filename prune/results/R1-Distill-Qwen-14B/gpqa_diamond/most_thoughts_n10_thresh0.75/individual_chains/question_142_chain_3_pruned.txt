Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture) rather than a pure state.

The question gives me this density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly to find the geometrical position from this. Wait, I think I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the state, right? For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and the Bloch vector is (x, y, z), where x = <σ_x>, y = <σ_y>, z = <σ_z>, and σ's are the Pauli matrices.

But wait, this ρ isn't a pure state. It's a mixed state because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So the density matrix is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. So in this case, the density matrix ρ is actually a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. Let me write that out explicitly:

ρ = [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]

So, how to find the Bloch vector here. Because for a pure state, the Bloch vector is found by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a mixed state, I think the expectation values are calculated the same way, but they might not satisfy the normalization condition of a pure state. 

So, the general formula for the Bloch vector r is given by r = (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩), where each component is the expectation value of the respective Pauli matrix. 

Let me compute each of these. The expectation value of σ_i is Tr(ρ σ_i), right?

σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So let's compute each expectation.

First, ⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2) Tr( (|0><0| + |1><1|) * σ_x )

Wait, wait, maybe it's easier to compute each term separately.

Wait, actually, ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

So each term is |0><0| and |1><1| multiplied by 1/2.

So for each Pauli matrix, the expectation value is (1/2) <0|σ_i|0> + (1/2) <1|σ_i|1>.

Let me compute each component:

For σ_z:

<σ_z> = (1/2) <0|σ_z|0> + (1/2) <1|σ
