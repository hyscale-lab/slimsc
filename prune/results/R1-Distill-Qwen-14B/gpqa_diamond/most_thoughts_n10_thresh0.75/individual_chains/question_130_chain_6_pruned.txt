Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet range, right? And in quasars, when this line is emitted, if there's neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, it can absorb this light, creating what's called the Lyman-alpha forest. So the question is about the redshift where this absorption becomes detectable using optical telescopes.

Wait, optical telescopes on the ground can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So if the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms (which is about 121.6 nanometers, putting it in the far UV), but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe that wavelength. So the absorbed light must be redshifted into the optical range.

Redshift z is calculated by the formula (observed wavelength)/(emitted wavelength) - 1. So for the Lyman alpha line, emitted at 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength has to be in the optical range. What's the optical range? I think visible light is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, the quasar emits light that passes through these clouds, and the clouds absorb the Lyman-alpha wavelength. So the quasar's light, which originally has the Lyman-alpha emission, is absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. But for us to see this absorption in the optical range, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical. So the redshift z is such that 1216*(1 + z) is within the optical window.

But wait, no, because the quasar might be at a higher redshift. The hydrogen clouds are in the line of sight, so their redshift would be lower than the quasar
