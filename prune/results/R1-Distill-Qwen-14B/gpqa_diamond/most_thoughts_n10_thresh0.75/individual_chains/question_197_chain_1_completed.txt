Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product after a reaction. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the HI (hydroiodic) acid cleavage reaction, especially for ozonolysis. Wait, no, ozonolysis usually uses ozone followed by reductive workup. Oh wait, right, when you have an alkene and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's an example of a hydrohalogenation reaction, but wait, isn't that more like a hydration or something else? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm, wait no, I think that's the hydrohalogenation via the acid-catalyzed addition. Or wait, maybe it's the cleavage of an ozonide. Oh yeah, ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with Zn and H2O would give aldehydes or ketones, but if you use something else, like H2O2, you might get different products. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! The reaction is the cleavage of a vicinal dihalide (like after dibromide addition) with HI and red P. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI is used for the elimination of HX from certain dihalides, especially when reacting with alkenes. Oh wait, no, that's more the anti-Markovnikov addition ofHX. Wait, no, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is the Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Oh wait, maybe it's the reduction of a carbonyl group. Wait, no, because I don't see any info on that in the problem.

Wait, the initial reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. Oh! I think that's the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene. Because, when you have an alkene and treat it with HI, it's a hydrohalogenation, typically adding across the double bond. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus might be involved in the preparation of a ylide for an elimination reaction, but that's more for Wittig reactions. Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group. Let me first try to determine what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of X.

The IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or an N-H stretch, but since there’s no NMR data for NH protons, maybe O-H. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, possibly from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10, but that's a doublet. But a singlet at 10.5 could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the -COOH protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, but maybe it's a phenol? No, because phenols are around 5 ppm. So more likely a carboxylic acid.

Then there's a 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests para-substituted aromatic protons. Like in a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups. Since we have a carbonyl in IR, maybe a substituent is a carbonyl group.

The other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH or something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to something, maybe an O or a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group (like a ketone or a carboxylic acid) and another substituent that's an ethyl group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR has a 1720 peak. Let's think: for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700-1725 cm-1. If it's an ester, it's around 1730-1750. A ketone is about 1700-1720. So 1720 could be any of these, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the carbonyl is a COOH group.

So, structure-wise, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester, but the NMR doesn't show the ester oxygen, but wait, the -OCH2CH3 would have protons around 1-2 ppm as a quartet, but I don't see that here. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for the OH of a carboxylic acid. Then, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are para to each other. So, the substituents on the benzene ring are a -COOH group and another group. Let's see, what else.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is likely a CH(CH3), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So putting this together, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Or perhaps a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring are a -COOH and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Let me try to build this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, but then the NMR would show a different pattern. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way. Let me think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a methylene or a CH group that's near a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and the 1.4 (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, making a CH(CH3). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is another CH2CH3 group.

Wait, that seems like a branching. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring.

But wait, the substituent on the benzene is a group that is more complex. Let's consider:

If the substituent on the benzene is a -COOH (from the IR and NMR), and another group that's an ethyl or propyl chain with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group (like CH2CH2COOH), but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, let me try to structure it.

The benzene ring has a -COOH group (from the 1720 cm-1 and 10.5 ppm). The other substituent must account for the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

Looking at the NMR, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 connected to another CH2. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH connected to a carbonyl.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But wait, that wouldn't explain all the signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CO- group, but then the NMR would have different signals.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 substituent. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which would be the end of a three-carbon chain. So, perhaps a propyl group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: The NMR signals suggest a five-carbon substituent attached to the benzene. Let me think: 

The 10.5 ppm is the -COOH OH.

The aromatic protons are 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): so a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

The other signals:

- 2.9 (m, 1H): perhaps a CH adjacent to carbonyl.

- 1.7 (m, 2H): a CH2 next to the CH.

- 1.4 (d, 3H): a methyl attached to the CH.

- 0.9 (t, 3H): a terminal CH3.

So, this suggests a structure like:

Benzene ring with substituents at para positions: one is -COOH, the other is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propanoic acid group and an ethyl group attached. Wait, but let's see.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)COOH group, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent that's a branched chain. Let me think: the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring.

Wait, but then how does that fit the NMR data?

The 2.9 ppm could be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, no, because if it's a ketone, the CH would be next to carbonyl. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, but the NMR doesn't show a typical ketone's CH2 or CH3.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring, making a structure like:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

But that doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branching. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Then, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But where is the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-CH2CH3 group, but that would require more carbons.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a -COOCH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But that would be an ester, which would have its own NMR signals, like an OCH2 group, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached. But then, the substituent with the CH and CH2 groups would be part of the same chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. Let me count the protons:

For the substituent -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, the CH would have one H (but in the NMR, it's m, 1H at 2.9 ppm). The CH2 groups would have their protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Then, the CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, but that would require the benzene ring to have a CH2-CH(CH2CH3) substituent. Let's see:

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)

But then, the NMR signals would be:

- The CH2 would be split into a triplet or quartet, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): that could be the CH attached to the benzene. Then, the CH2 adjacent would be at 1.7 (m, 2H), and the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 (t, 3H). Also, the 1.4 (d, 3H) could be a methyl attached to another CH, but in this structure, I don't see that.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach.

Looking at the substituent, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, a sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to something. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's iso-butyl.

Wait, no, wait:

- Propyl: CH2CH2CH3.

- Iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2.

- Sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the substituents mixed up. Let me recall:

The substituents:

- n-propyl: CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-propyl: CH(CH3)2.

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2.

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as a butyl group. Let me see.

If the substituent is a iso-butyl group attached to the ring, then the structure would be Ph-CH2-C(CH3)2. But wait, that's a tert-butyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that's a pentyl group.

Wait, looking back at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain.

Let me try to build it:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 group, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3) group. Wait, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. For example, Ph-CH2-C(CH3)2. But that would be a tert-butyl group attached via a CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2 which is attached to the ring. Let me think: Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). That would make a structure with a CH2 connected to the ring, and a CH(CH2CH3) connected to that CH2.

In that case, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). Let's see if that fits the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH (from CH(CH2CH3)), but wait, that's a CH with two adjacent CH2 groups. Its NMR signal would be a multiplet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2.

The CH2 group next to the ring would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH2CH3 at the end would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? Unless there's a methyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group attached to a CH2 that is attached to the ring. So, Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But that doesn't account for the 1.4 ppm methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached. Let me calculate the NMR:

The CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have a CH with adjacent CH2 groups. Its proton would be a triplet of triplets or some multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would have a triplet at around 1.7 ppm. The end CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? Unless there's a methyl group on the CH, like CH(CH3).

Wait, that's it! The substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Alternatively, wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to map the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) must be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or another electronegative group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be a CH2 group adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group attached to the ring, but I'm not getting how that fits.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, like Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that seems too long.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached, but that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a propionyl group. Like Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would give a ketone, but the NMR shows a -COOH group.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. So, perhaps it's a COOH group.

Wait, let me think again. The substituents on the benzene are a -COOH and a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH(CH3))- group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the reaction.

The reaction is Compound X + red phosphorus and HI → product.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the acid-catalyzed addition of HI to alkenes. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus can be used in the presence of iodine to perform elimination reactions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction for reducing carbonyl groups. No, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and heat with a base like NaOH or NH2NH2, then NaClO4 and heat. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the hydroiodic acid cleavage of a vicinal dihalide, but that would produce alkenes. But if X has a dihalide, then reacting with HI would give an alkene. But I don't have information about dihalides in X.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, let's think about the options given. The options are A to D.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a benzene ring with ethyl group at para and a propanoic acid group.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group in the para position.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. A benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group in the para positions.

Wait, so the product after the reaction is one of these.

Let me think about what reaction leads to which product.

If X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction that could either reduce the carbonyl or add HI across a double bond.

Wait, another approach: if X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then reacting with HI could add across the double bond if there's an alkene. But I don't see any alkene info.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone group and a substituent with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(propenyl)benzoic acid. Then, treatment with HI might lead to addition across the double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X has an ester group. Let me think, an ester would have a carbonyl and an O-R group. The NMR doesn't show oxygenated protons, though.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid substituent and a propyl chain that's adjacent to a carbonyl. So, for example, something like Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9, which fits a CH2CH3 group.

Let me try to think of the structure of X as a 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent is likely a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the ring. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-. But then, where is the carbonyl?

Ah, wait, if it's Ph-COOH and a substituent that's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, then perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. But then, the substituents would be at the ortho or para positions.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which are para. So, the substituents are para, meaning the benzene has two substituents in the para positions: a -COOH and a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

So, the structure of X would be 4-(propyl group)benzoic acid. Let's see:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a butyl group. Wait, no, it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- which would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group (from CH(CH3)), the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the -CH2- next to the ring, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl on the CH(CH3), and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the methyl at the end of the chain. But wait, that would require a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group, making the structure Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Let's see:

The NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH proton at around 2.9 ppm.

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm as a quartet or multiplet.

- The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) come from? That's a methyl group attached to a CH.

Ah, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. But then the substituent would be at the para position.

So, putting it all together, X is 4-(propyl)benzoic acid, but with a branching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. 

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

- The adjacent CH2 group (Ph-CH2-) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The methyl (CH3) on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The terminal CH3 from the CH2CH3 group is at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Wait, no, because the substituent is only -CH2-CH(CH3)-, so the end would be a CH3 group attached to CH, not another CH2CH3. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Then, the structure would be Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-COOH. But that would make the CH group a singlet or something else, and the adjacent CH2 groups would have their own signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps it's time to think about the reaction. The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI. I think that when an alkene is treated with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it leads to the anti-Markovnikov addition of HI. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be a hydration reaction if the alkene is present.

Wait, another thought: if X has a ketone group, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. But wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. So that's probably not applicable here.

Alternatively, the reaction could be the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene to form a diol. But then, X would have a double bond, and the product would have an alcohol group. But the options given don't show any alcohols.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a carbonyl group and a double bond, and the reaction adds HI across the double bond, leading to a dihalide or some addition product.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the options. Let's look at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group (since sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)).

So, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached to the ring. Let me see if that matches the NMR.

In this case, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

The NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group (from the sec-butyl) would have a proton at ~2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

- The adjacent CH2 (from the -CH2- part) would have protons at ~1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

- The methyl group on the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The terminal end of the sec-butyl is a CH2 group, but in this case, it's attached to another CH3. Wait, no, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but the sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, no—sec-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of IUPAC nomenclature.

The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)1-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon substituent.

Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So, it's a butyl group with branching at the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to think about it is that the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that would make the substituent an iso-pentyl group? I'm getting a bit stuck on the nomenclature, but perhaps the key point is that the substituent has a branching.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then its structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let's see if this matches the NMR:

- The aromatic protons: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) → para substituents.

- The COOH group: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- The substituent: The CH(CH3) group would have a proton at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The adjacent CH2 group (from the -CH2-) would have protons at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH3 group attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The terminal CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Wait, but in this structure, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, the substituent is the sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring. Let me think.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again. The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI. If X has a double bond, adding HI would follow anti-Markovnikov addition. But if X has a carbonyl group, maybe it's a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group. Wait, if X has a ketone, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it's reduced to a secondary alcohol. But in that case, the product would have an -OH group, which isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carbonyl group but adds HI elsewhere.

Wait, if X has an alkene and a carbonyl group, perhaps the reaction adds HI to the alkene. For example, if X is a cinnamic acid derivative, adding HI would give a dihalide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain that has a double bond. Then, adding HI would add across the double bond.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction is an acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene, the product would have an alcohol group. But looking at the options, none of them have an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of an alkene to form a dihalide. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a vicinal dihalide. For example, if X has a dihalide (like 1,2-dibromoalkane), treatment with HI and red phosphorus would give an alkene. But then the product would be an alkene, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxy iodide reaction, which is an acid-catalyzed addition of HI to alkenes. The addition would proceed via the anti-Markovnikov orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkene to form an alcohol, but that would require a different catalyst, like H2SO4.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction involves the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's unlikely with HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol using red phosphorus and HI. For example, if X is a ketone, the reaction would reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But the options don't show any alcohols, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydroiodination of an alkene. So, if X has a double bond, the reaction would add HI across it, following anti-Markovnikov.

But let's look at the options again. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the product is a benzoic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the acid group but adds HI to another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, and the reaction adds HI to the aldehyde group. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed addition of HI to an alkyne, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a diiodide to form an alkene, but that's the opposite of what's being asked.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know so far.

IR of X: strong peak at 1720 → likely a carbonyl, probably a carboxylic acid (since the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for -COOH).

NMR of X:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad) → -COOH.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each 2H, doublets) → para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (1H, multiplet) → CH group adjacent to something electronegative.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, multiplet) → CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, doublet) → CH(CH3).

- 0.9 ppm (3H, triplet) → CH2CH3.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a -COOH and another group which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group.

Wait, no, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, making the substituent a propyl group with a branch.

So, the structure of X is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let me see if that fits.

In this case, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

So, when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrohalogenation of an internal alkene. But if X doesn't have a double bond, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a double bond adjacent to the substituent. For example, Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps X has a double bond between the CH2 and CH(CH3). So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-C=CH-COOH. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group. For example, Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a double bond between the benzene ring and the substituent, making it a styrene derivative. But that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck on the reaction part. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH.

If X is this compound, then what reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene. But X doesn't have an alkene. Unless X has an ester group and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent. Then, the reaction would add HI to the aldehyde. But that doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond. For example, if X has a vicinal dihalide, the reaction would eliminate to form an alkene. But the options don't show any alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of a nitrile to form a ketone, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but again, that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the iodolactamization, but that's for amides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but that would require different reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution reaction. If X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, then HI would substitute it. But without knowing X's structure, it's hard to say.

Hmm, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Looking at the options, only options A and C are carboxylic acids. The reaction uses red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid. If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, the reaction could reduce it to a benzyl alcohol, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if X is a ketone, the reaction could reduce it to a secondary alcohol, but again, the options don't show that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds HI to a double bond in X, but X doesn't have a double bond. Or maybe X does have a double bond, and the reaction adds HI, but the product isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a dihalide adjacent to the carbonyl group, converting it into a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is simply a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by HI. But without knowing the structure of X, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrodehalogenation, but that's more for elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that's unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a benzal chloride to form a carboxylic acid, but that's stretching it.

Wait, another angle: if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction is the addition of HI, but the product is a dihydroxy compound. But again, not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the benzene ring but affects the substituent. For example, if the substituent is an ester, the reaction could hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, only A and C are acids.

Wait, if X is an ester, like Ph-CO-O-R, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might not do much. Alternatively, ester hydrolysis requires strong acid or base conditions.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the formation of an acid from a nitrile. But that would require a different reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, but that's more a reaction with H2O and acid.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to a carbonyl group. But that's more for ketones or aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a substituent.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, let's try to make an educated guess based on the NMR and IR data.

The IR suggests a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a substituent that's a branched chain with a terminal methyl group.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would fit the NMR data, as the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what reaction occurs with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, but if X is already a carboxylic acid, what would the reaction do? Maybe it would not react, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction saponifies it to a carboxylic acid. But that would require a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzal chloride, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene in X to form a diol, but X would need a double bond.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl benzoic acid, and the reaction adds HI across the triple bond. But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkene to form a ketone, but the options don't show that.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to think of the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxyiodide reaction, which is the anti-Markovnikov addition of HI to alkenes. The product would be an iodide on the less substituted carbon.

But if X doesn't have a double bond, this wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a triple bond, and the reaction adds HI across it. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe X has a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond. For example, a cinnamic acid derivative. Then, treatment with HI would add across the double bond.

But without knowing X's exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the double bond but affects the substituent in another way.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps it's time to conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR data fits a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a sec-butyl substituent.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to determine its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of the -COOH proton.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for a methyl group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a terminal methyl group.

From the NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The structure consists of a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)) in the para positions.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydroxyiodide reaction, which is an anti-Markovnikov addition of HI to alkenes. However, since Compound X does not contain a double bond, the reaction does not involve addition to a double bond. Instead, the reaction likely does not alter the carboxylic acid group or the benzene ring but may affect the substituent. Given the options, the product remains consistent with the structure of Compound X.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which matches the description in option C.
