Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time to break it down. Alright, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. The substituents are on carbons 1 and 3, and they're bromines.

The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking about elimination reactions here. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (if it's 1,3, maybe they are on opposite sides?), heating with base would likely cause dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... Oh, wait no, the structure of adamantane is such that 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or are they across from each other? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But regardless, the reaction with KOH would probably eliminate two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of an alkene. Oh wait, with excess KOH, maybe it's a double elimination. So the product 1 would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which is probably a diene or an alkene. Wait, no, wait—another possibility is that it forms an epoxide, but no, that would require an oxide attacking, but KOH isn't typically for epoxidation. Or maybe it's a ring-opening elimination. Hmm.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids in organic reactions—could that be a diol? No, because KOH is a base and would lead to elimination, not substitution. Wait another thought: maybe it's an elimination to form a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diene or an annulene.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 has some specific signals. Let me look at the NMR data provided. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Also, IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a ketone group. Oh wait, that makes sense! Because if you have a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, how do you get a ketone from that? Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an oxidation. Wait, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the adamantane structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH would likely undergo elimination. Since the molecule is highly strained (adamantane isn't, but the substituents are in certain positions), the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond
