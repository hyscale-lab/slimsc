Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when a star has spots. Interesting.

Alright, the setup: the star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the question is about the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots), right?

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the formula is usually written as n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) )? Or maybe it's (E_j - E_i) in the exponent. Let me think. Because higher energy states have lower populations at lower temperatures. So, if E2 is higher than E1, then for T, a lower T would make the exponential term smaller, so n1 would be higher relative to n2.

But in this problem, when the spots are present, the overall T_eff is lower. So when the star has spots, T is lower. If the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing when the star has spots, that means that the ratio is lower in the lower T case. Let's think, when T is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So for n1/n2=(g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), if E2>E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k T) smaller. Wait, no, T is in the denominator. So as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger in magnitude, but since E2>E1, it's positive, so exponentiating a larger positive number makes the exponential bigger. So n1/n2 increases as T decreases, which would mean that if the ratio is observed to decrease when spots are present, that suggests that n1/n2 is increasing, but wait the observed ratio is decreasing. Wait, no, wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (with spots), n1/n2 is lower. Hmm, let me get this right.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio opposite. The ratio in question is the number of atoms
