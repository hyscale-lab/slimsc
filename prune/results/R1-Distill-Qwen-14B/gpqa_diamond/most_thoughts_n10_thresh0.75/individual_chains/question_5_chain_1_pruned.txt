Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

First, I'll try to remember what an eigenvector is. An eigenvector of an operator is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when the operator is applied. That scalar is the eigenvalue. So, for the operator P, if |v> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ, then P|v> = λ|v>.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the operator we're considering isn't just one of the components (like Px, Py, or Pz), but a combination of them along the direction n. That is, the operator P is the sum of its components in the direction of n. So, I think I need to find the operator P along the direction n, then find its eigenvector.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So n can be written as a vector with components (nx, 0, nz). Since it's in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So the unit vector n is (nx, 0, nz) where nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator along direction n is P = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because Py's component is along y, but n is in x-z plane, so the direction doesn't involve y. So the operator we're looking at is P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Each P component is given. Let me write them out:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, substituting the components:

P = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz * 1, nx * 1], [nx * 1, (-nz) * 1] ]

Wait, let me check the matrix multiplication. The first term (nx P_x) has elements (0, nx/2 ħ in (1,2) and (2,1)), and the second term (nz P_z) adds nz/2 ħ in (1,1) and -nz/2 ħ in (2,2).

So the matrix becomes:

P = (ħ/2) * [
    [nz, nx],
    [nx, -nz]
