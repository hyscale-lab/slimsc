Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in some kind of substitution or possibly elimination reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's related to the substitution of a functional group. Like, maybe a hydrolysis or something else.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That makes me think of either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) or an N-H stretch, but there's no mention of amines here. Oh wait, another possibility is an alkene with C-H stretches, but those are usually in that range too. But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids) show up around there. 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone, which is usually around 1700-1750. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches too, which are broad. Oh, but wait, in the IR, the broad region is 3400-2500, which could be O-H from a carboxylic acid, or maybe an alcohol. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

Now the NMR data. Let's parse that.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:
-10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet. That's a very upfield or downfield? Wait, 10.5 is actually quite downfield. What gives a peak around 10 ppm? Maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehydes are around 9-10, but a carboxylic acid is around 10-12, sometimes broader. But sometimes aromatic protons can be around 7-8,
