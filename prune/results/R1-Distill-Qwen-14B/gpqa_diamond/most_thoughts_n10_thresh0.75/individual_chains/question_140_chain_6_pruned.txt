Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

I think I'll start by identifying each part of the reaction.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Let's think about what X could be. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like LiAlH4 (lithium aluminum hydride), which is a strong reducing agent. Another possibility could be a Grignard reagent, but those are typically magnesium-based. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NaBH4, but LiAlH4 is more reactive and commonly used in such cases.

Wait, LiAlH4 reacts with carbonyl compounds. But in this question, it's reacting with a keto acid. Wait, the product of the keto acid reaction has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: a keto acid is something like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group. Wait, no, a keto acid is a carboxylic acid where the carbonyl is adjacent to the carboxylic group. For example, like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with a reducing agent, perhaps it gets reduced. LiAlH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but in a keto acid, maybe the ketone part is reduced, and the acid part is deprotonated or something?

Wait, the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. Let me think: if the keto acid is, say, (R)COCH2COOH, and the LiAlH4 reduces the ketone, the product would be (R)CH(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that would change the number of oxygen atoms. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is something like (R)COCH2COOH and when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, so the product would have more oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product has two
