Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

So, the question talks about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has two oxygen atoms. 

Hmm, let's think. I remember that when metals react with certain liquids, like acids or bases, they can produce gases. The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Wait, so the molecule of W has same p and n. For example, O2 would have 8 protons each, but in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (wait, no, 8 neutrons would make O-16, which is the most common isotope). Wait, but W is a molecule; maybe it's H2O or something else. No, wait, let me get back to the problem.

The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K. Water freezes at 273 K, so 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ice, but I don't think so. Wait, maybe B is something else. Oh, wait, 277 K is roughly 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (0°C), but maybe it's a substance that's just around that temperature. Hmm. Alternatively, could B be something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe B is NH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of substance X with liquid Y. If X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid. For example, metals like Mg, Ca, or something else. The reaction produces gas W. Let me think: if X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce H2 gas, maybe. But wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. H2 has 1 proton each. So each H has 1 p and 0 n, which doesn't fit. So maybe another gas.

Wait, what about O2? O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (for each O atom). So W could be O2, but then the reaction would have to produce O2. Alternatively, could it be something else?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is CO2. But each CO2 molecule has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons in the most common isotope. O has 8 each. So for CO2, each O has 8 p and 8 n. But that would mean the entire molecule would have 6+16=22 p and 16 n? No, wait, the molecule's total? No, the question says each molecule of W has same number of p and n.
