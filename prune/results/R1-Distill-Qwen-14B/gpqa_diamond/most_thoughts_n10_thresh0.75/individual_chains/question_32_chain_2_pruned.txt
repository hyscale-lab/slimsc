Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor and is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, the formula for energy E is E = gamma * m0c².

Wait, but I need to find the energy per nucleus, right? So I should find the rest mass of the nucleus first. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals mass number 6.

So the atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. I think the atomic mass can be found using the periodic table. Let me recall, the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. But wait, that's the molar mass. To find the mass of a single nucleus, I need to convert grams per mole to kilograms and then divide by Avogadro's number.

Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 particles per mole. So the mass of one Li-6 nucleus would be (6.941 g/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) converted into kilograms. Let me calculate that. Wait, 6.941 grams is 0.006941 kg. So 0.006941 kg/mol divided by 6.022e23 atoms/mol gives per nucleus mass.

So 0.006941 kg/mol / 6.022e23 atoms/mol = approximately 1.152e-27 kg per nucleus. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.006941 divided by 6.022e23 is about 1.152e-27 kg. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the speed is 0.96c. Let's compute gamma. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.96² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So now, the energy E is gamma * m0c². Let me compute m0c² first. The rest energy is m0 * c squared. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So m0 is 1.152e-27 kg. Multiply by (3e8)^2, which is 9e16. So 1.152e-27 * 9e16 = 1.152 *9e-11 = 10.368e-11 J. Wait that's 1.0368e-10 Joules. But I need this in GeV.

Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to get Joules to eV, divide by 1.602e-19. Then, to get GeV, divide by 1e9.

So m0c² is 1.0368e-10 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 6.47e8 eV. Which is 647 MeV. Wait, no, wait: 1.0368e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.0368e-10) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 6.47e8 eV, which is 647 MeV, so 0.647 GeV.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation. 1.152e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.152e-27 * 9e16 = 1.0368e-10 kg m²/s², which is Joules.

Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1e18 eV / (1.602e-19) = 1/(1.602e-19) ≈ 6.242e18 eV. So 1 J is 6.242e18 eV.

So 1.0368e-10 J = 1.0368e-10 * 6.242e18 eV = 1.0368 *6.242e8 eV ≈ 6.473e8 eV = 647.3 MeV. So 0.6473 GeV.

So m0c² is about 0.6473
