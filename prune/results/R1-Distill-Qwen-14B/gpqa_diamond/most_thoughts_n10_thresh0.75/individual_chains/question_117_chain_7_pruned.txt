Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each combining some of the numbers 1 to 4.

First, I remember that optical isomerism, also known as optical activity, occurs when a compound has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. If a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These enantiomers will rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, hence the term optical isomers.

So I need to check each of the four compounds to see if they have any chiral centers.

Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, the name is a bit complex, but let me break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2-position of each ring. So each benzene ring has a carboxylate group at position 2. Also, each ring has a nitro group at position 6. Then, the substituents are ester groups (since it's dimethyl, so the ester is OMe).

Wait, the structure is like two benzene rings connected, each with substituents. Are there any chiral centers here? Well, each benzene ring is a planar structure, so the substituents are attached in certain positions. But wait, the central bond is a single bond, meaning the rings can rotate. So if the substituents are in positions that could lead to different configurations, maybe there's a possibility of stereoisomerism.

Wait, but for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center. So are there any carbons attached to four different groups in this molecule?

Looking at the substituents: the carboxylate groups are OCO2Me. The nitro groups are NO2. On each benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, but benzene substituents are attached to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. Are any of those carbons chiral? Let me think—aromatic rings are flat, so the attached substituents are in a plane. But each substituent is on a carbon that's connected to the ring. For example, the 2-position has a carbonyl group attached to the ring. Is that carbon (the one in the ring) a chiral center? No, because the ring is planar, and the substituents are attached to the same carbon, which is part of the aromatic system. So each of those positions—2 and 6—on each ring have substituents, but they're attached to a carbon that's part of the ring, which is sp2 hybridized, not sp3. So those carbons can't be chiral centers because they don't have four different substituents. 

Wait, so perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not so sure. Another thought: if the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, maybe there's a possibility of E and Z isomerism, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. So this might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a chiral center elsewhere. Are there any other carbons in the molecule that are attached to four different groups?

The ester groups are OMe. The methyl groups are attached to the oxygen. So the ester groups on the biphenyl are at the 2 and 2' positions. Wait, each ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl. So maybe the adjacent carbons, like the ones next to the carbonyl, could be chiral? Let me imagine the structure. The carbox
