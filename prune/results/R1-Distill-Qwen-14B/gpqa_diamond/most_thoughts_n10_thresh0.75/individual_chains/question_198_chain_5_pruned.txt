Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, also known as formation constants, are involved here. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, so that's the second complex in the series. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So, the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) for n=1,2,3,4. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the problem says "blue dithiocyanato" which is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. So the percentage we're looking for is the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^0 relative to all cobalt species.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum them up, then find the fraction of the desired one.

But how do I model this? I think it's a problem of log K's and the distribution of metal complexes. I remember the formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

Wait, the formation of each complex involves adding SCN- step by step. The fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN]^n) / (sum over m=1 to 4 of β_m [Co][SCN]^m) )

Wait, no, wait. Since the total cobalt is [Co]total = [Co] (the free ion) + sum of all complexes. But I'm getting a bit confused here
