Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, muons are elementary particles, similar to electrons but heavier. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are often represented by matrices. The problem states that Ay is given by c multiplied by the matrix S, where c is h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, right? So c is a constant scaling factor.

The matrix S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

And Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay = (h/4π) * S.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Eigenvalues are found by solving the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

So the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's compute that.

First, let's write out the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c * S:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the elements are:
Ay[1,1] = 0
Ay[1,2] = -(i h)/(4π)
Ay[2,1] = (i h)/(4π)
Ay[2,2] = 0

The characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0. The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a)] - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² - [ (i)(-i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, i * (-i) is (-i²) which is - (-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (h²)/(16 π²) * (1) = h²/(16 π²)

So the equation is a² - h²/(16 π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait. Let me compute the square root correctly. Wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), because (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²). So a is ± h/(4π) * (1/(2)) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me compute sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) again. It is h/(4π), because 4π squared is 16 π². So sqrt is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2)? Or wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me re-express the equation:

Wait, det(Ay - a I) = a² - ( (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) = a² - ( (i * -i) (h²)/(16 π²) ) )

i*(-i) is -i² which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, no: wait, h/(4π) squared is h²/(16 π²). So sqrt of that is h/(4π). So a is ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but the options don't seem to mention these values. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). Hmm, that can't be, because eigenvalues are real in this case. Or are they?

Wait, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues, right? Because they are Hermitian operators. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

Is Ay = c * S Hermitian? S is a matrix. Let me see S† (the conjugate transpose of S):

The first row of S is [0, -i], the second row is [i, 0].

The conjugate transpose would have the first column as [0, i], and the second column as [ -i, 0].

So S† would be:

[ 0, i ]
[ -i, 0 ]

Which is -S, because S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0 ]

Wait, S† = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] and S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. So S† = -S. Because S is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, if S is anti-Hermitian, then S† = -S. So then Ay = c S, and c is real.

So Ay† = (c S)† = c* S† = c*(-S) = - c S = -Ay.

So Ay is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian. Oh wait, but angular momentum operators are usually Hermitian. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz are Hermitian. But S itself is a 2x2 matrix. Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and satisfy σ† = σ. Let me think about this.

Wait, the matrix S given is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

Let me compute S†. The complex conjugate transpose:

The element (1,2) is -i → its conjugate is i. So the (2,1) element in S† is i. The (2,1) element in S is i, so S†[2,1] = i. So S† is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ].

Compare to S: [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So S† is equal to -S, because:

- S = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ]

Which matches S†. So S is anti-Hermitian: S† = -S.

So then, Ay = c S. Since c is real, Ay is anti-Hermitian. So Ay† = -Ay.

But for an observable, the operator must be Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. Wait, but this problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait. The intrinsic angular momentum operator J is usually represented in terms of ħ times the Pauli matrices. For example, Jx = (ħ/2) σx, etc. So perhaps in this case, the matrix S is supposed to represent the spin operator scaled appropriately.

Wait, perhaps the S matrix is actually (σy)/2, because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and the spin matrices for electrons are (σx, σy, σz)/
