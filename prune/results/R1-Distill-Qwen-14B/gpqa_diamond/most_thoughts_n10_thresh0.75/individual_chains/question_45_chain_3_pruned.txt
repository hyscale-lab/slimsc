Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, but I'll try to figure it out without just guessing.

First, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of each particle is given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared, where E is the base energy (E = π²ħ²/(2mL²)). So each state n corresponds to an energy of n²E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means, in the same quantum state, no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum number is just n, right? So each particle must have a unique n, or if they share the same n, they must have different spins.

Wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each spatial state n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. So the maximum number of particles you can have in the same n is two.

But wait, the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So we need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states considering the Pauli exclusion.

The ground state (lowest energy) would have the particles in the lowest possible energy levels, filling up each n with two particles each until all four are placed.

Let me think: the ground state would have as many particles as possible in the lowest n, then next, etc., but each n can hold two particles.

So for four particles:

- n=1 can hold 2 particles (each with spin up and down)
- n=2 can hold 2 particles

Wait, but that's four particles. So in the ground state, particles are in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1)^2 = E. There are two, so 2E. Each in n=2 contributes E*(2)^2 =4E. Two particles, so 8E. Total energy: 2E +8E =10E? Wait, wait, no, wait, maybe I added wrong. 2E (from two particles each at E) plus 8E (two particles each at 4E) is 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E? Wait, but looking at the options, that's not an option for the ground state. Because in the options, the first excited state is sometimes higher. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The problem is about four particles, so the ground state energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but for four particles in the same spatial state, that can't happen because of the Pauli exclusion
