Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question gives me the 1H NMR data for an unknown organic compound, and I need to identify it from four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl groups, and whether the substituents are cis or trans. So, first, I should probably draw the structures of each to see how their NMR spectra would look.

Looking at the NMR data provided:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me jot down what each of these signals might correspond to.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm with 3H is probably an acetate group, OAc. The -OAc group typically has a singlet around 2 ppm because all three methyl protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons.

The doublet at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) suggests a proton that's coupled to another proton with a coupling constant of about 16 Hz. Since 16 Hz is a large coupling, that's probably between two protons on adjacent carbons, maybe in a vinyl group (like a double bond). In a trans configuration, the coupling constants can be larger as the protons are on opposite sides.

The doublet of triplets (dq) at 5.5 ppm. Hmm, a doublet of quartets or something? Wait, the description says 'dq', which I think means doublet of quadruplets? Or maybe it's a doublet with some splitting from coupling to two different sets of protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of doublets, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet with some splitting, but I'm not certain.

Let me think about the possible structures.

First, the compound is an acetate ester, so the general structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, the structure is probably an ester, like CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, an acetate ester is CH3CO-O-R. So the acetate group is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the R group. So the R group in this case is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether it's cis or trans.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Its structure would be CH2-C(OAc)-CH2, but wait, maybe I should draw it more accurately. Wait, propenyl groups have three carbons, with a double bond. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Hmm, no.
