Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in these kinds of problems, the potential often separates into parts that can be solved in polar coordinates.

Wait, so the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me try to see if I can factor this or separate it into radial and angular parts. Oh, wait, because in polar coordinates, sometimes the Hamiltonian can be separated into radial and angular components if the potential allows it. 

So, the first term, (1/2)kr², is a radial term. It's like a spring potential in the radial direction, right? Because a harmonic oscillator in r would have a potential (1/2)k r². Then the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos squared theta can be expressed using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me write that out: (3/2)kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. That simplifies to (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Wait, so the potential can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So V = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm on the right track. Maybe I should consider the form of the potential and how it affects the Hamiltonian. The total potential is a function of r and θ, so the Hamiltonian would be the sum of the kinetic energy in 2D and this potential.

The kinetic energy in polar coordinates is (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/r²) (d/dr (r dr))² + (1/(r² sin²θ)) (d/dθ)^2 ]. So, the Hamiltonian is H = T + V. But for the potential, it looks like V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so can this be expressed as a sum of terms that depend only on r and terms that depend on θ?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes it's easier to see the separation into x and y components that way. Let me think, in 2D polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, and cos²θ = x²/(r²). Therefore, the potential can be expressed as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² (x²)/(
