Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Okay, the question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

First, I remember that in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation is solved using polar coordinates. So maybe I should express the problem in polar coordinates. Oh wait, the potential is already given in terms of r and θ, so that's helpful.

Looking at the potential, I notice it's made up of two parts: (1/2)k r² is like a harmonic oscillator term, and (3/2)k r² cos²θ looks a bit like another term that might relate to angular motion. Wait, maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Because in polar coordinates, the potential might influence the radial and angular parts of the equation separately.

Let me think. The radial part usually depends on r, and the angular part on θ. So V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ) maybe? Let's check.

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out r², so it's r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ]. Hmm, that doesn't directly split into r and θ terms. Wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential as a sum of functions that depend only on r and θ respectively.

Wait another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of the angular momentum or something. Let me think about the form. The angular part is cos²θ, which reminds me of the potential in the hydrogen atom problem, where you have something like cos²θ terms leading to the angular part of the solution. Or maybe the potential is separable into terms that can be solved using harmonic oscillator solutions for the radial part and something else for the angular.

Wait, another thought: for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². But in this case, the potential is more complicated because it has the cos²θ term. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can think about whether the potential can be rewritten in terms of cos(2θ) using trigonometric identities. Because cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me do that:

V(r,θ) = (1/
