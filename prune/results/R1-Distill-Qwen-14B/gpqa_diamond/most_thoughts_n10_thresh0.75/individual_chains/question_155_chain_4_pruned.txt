Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z for an operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle says ΔA ΔB ≥ ħ/2 for incompatible observables A and B. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Wait, no, I should probably compute the expectation values to find the uncertainty.

So, the setup is that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually we choose the basis to diagonalize the operator we're measuring. So P_z is diagonal in this basis.

I need to find ΔP_z. The formula for the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, then what's the expectation value of P_z in this state?

Wait, wait. Let me think about this. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z is measured in its own basis. So the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, which means the expectation value might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation of P_z squared, then find the uncertainty.

But first, let me write down what I know. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

P_z is given as a matrix with diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ, and zeros elsewhere. So P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me calculate that. Since P_z is diagonal, each component just multiplies the corresponding component of ψ.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) [Wait, no, wait. Because P_z is diagonal, the matrix multiplication in the expectation value would be the sum of each
