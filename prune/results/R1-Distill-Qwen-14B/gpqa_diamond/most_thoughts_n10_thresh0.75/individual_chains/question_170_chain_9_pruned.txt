Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, so hopefully, I can figure this out.

Wait, first, I should probably remember what the expectation value formula is. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the state vector again. So, in symbols, it's <A> = ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector.

The state given is (3i, 4). Let me write that as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Oh wait, but sometimes in quantum mechanics, the spin states are represented as column vectors, right. So, that's our ψ.

The operator S_y is given as sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Because I remember that the spin operators are S_x = σ_x ħ/2, S_y = σ_y ħ/2, and S_z similarly. So, yeah, since the question is about S_y, I'll need to use σ_y multiplied by ħ/2.

The sigma_y matrix is:
[ 0  -i
  i   0 ]

So, S_y is (sigma_y) * (ħ/2). Let me write that out.

So, to find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's write out ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose of ψ. ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† should be [ -3 (because 3i becomes -3 when conjugated), 4 ] as a row vector. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The conjugate of 3i is -3, since i's conjugate is -i. And the conjugate of 4 is 4. So, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times the sigma_y matrix. So, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's represent that as a matrix.

Now, I think the expectation value is calculated as ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by ψ. Alternatively, since S_y is an operator, I can compute it as (ψ† S_y) multiplied by ψ, but I think it's more straightforward to compute it as ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the order. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. Since ψ is a column vector, S_y is a 2x2 matrix, so ψ† (which is a row vector) times S_y will give a row vector, which we then multiply by ψ (a column vector), resulting in a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step. Let me compute S_y ψ first. Then multiply ψ† by that result.

So, let's compute S_y ψ.
