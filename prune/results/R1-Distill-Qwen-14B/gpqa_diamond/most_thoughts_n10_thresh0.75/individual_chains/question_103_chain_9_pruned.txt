Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromo group, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring at the 1 position. Wait, actually, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a ketone (like an acetyl group) attached. The substituents on the benzene are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the acetyl group (from the ketone), bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: the ketone is at position 1. So the ring positions are 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, the positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to each other, but maybe they are meta relative to the ketone. Wait, no. Let me draw this mentally. The benzene ring is such that the ketone is attached at position 1. Then, substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So in terms of positions, the Br is at the meta position relative to the ketone, and the nitro is at the para position? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So if the ketone is at position 1, nitro at 5 is two positions away, and Br at 3 is two positions away in the other direction. Hmm, this might form a 1,3,5-substituted
