Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think. I remember that both are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations.

The question gives me five stars, each with different parameters. I need to figure out which of these can be observed by both instruments. The key is the apparent V magnitude each spectrograph can handle. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 to be visible by HIRES and less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag", that's stars with V magnitude less than 17. Same for HIRES: brighter than 16, so V mag less than 16.

So for a star to be detectable by both, it's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES can only go up to 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So any star with V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify: if a star is brighter than V mag 17, ESPRESSO can detect it. Brighter is lower number. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag < 17. For HIRES, apparent V mag < 16. So for both, the star must have apparent V mag ≤16.

So the star's apparent V magnitude determines which telescopes can see it. Now, each star is given either absolute magnitude and distance or apparent magnitude and other factors.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So I can calculate apparent magnitude using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). d is 10, so log(1) is 0. So m = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5. So apparent mag is 15.5. Both telescopes can see it since 15.5 <16 and <17.

Star2: Apparent V mag given as 16.5, located at 5 pc. Wait, but the apparent magnitude is already given, so no need to calculate. So m =16.5. Now, HIRES can only observe up to 16 mag. So this star is at 16.5, which is fainter than what HIRES can detect. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 <17. So this star can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but wait, there's extinction (E(B-V) =0.6 mag). So I need to correct for that. Extinction makes stars appear dimmer (higher magnitude). The formula given is total absorption in V band is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the total extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the true apparent magnitude without extinction is m_true = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. Because when extinction is present, the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_V. So the star's actual apparent magnitude is 13.64. So this is less than 16, so both telescopes can see it.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes extinction is subtracted. Let me think: if the star's apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_v. So if m_observed is 15.5, then m_true is 15.5 - A_v. So yes, 15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the star's true magnitude is 13.64, which is brighter than the apparent magnitude. So, the observed m is 15.5, but the intrinsic is 13.64. But for the spectrograph, what matters is the apparent V magnitude. Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter than it is. So if the star's apparent V magnitude (with extinction) is 15.5, then that's what the telescope detects. Wait, no, no. Wait, the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_true + A_v. So when you see a star with m_observed, it's brighter than the actual m_true. Wait, no, no, because extinction makes it dimmer (apparent magnitude increases, meaning it's fainter). So, if E(B-V)=0.6, A_V =3.1*0.6=1.86. So the observed m is m_true +1.86. So if m_observed is 15.5, then m_true is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. So the star's true apparent magnitude would be 13.64, but because of extinction, we observe it as 15.5. So for the purpose of detection, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So for both instruments, 15.5 is less than 16 and 17, so they can detect it. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: Absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. So as with Star1, m = M +5log(d/10). d=10, so m=15.5. Wait, but wait, there's E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24. So the observed m is m_true +1.24. But wait, what is the m here? The absolute magnitude is given, which is an intrinsic property. Wait, no. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude the star would have at 10 pc. So if Star4 is at 10 pc, then without extinction, it's m =15.5. But with extinction, the observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the apparent magnitude is 16.74. Now, HIRES can't detect above 16. So 16.74 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.74 <17. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Because Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5, which is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc without extinction. So if it's at 10 pc, and with extinction, its apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74. So yes, that is correct. So for Star4, the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. Only ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m = M +5 log(5/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5). Log(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505=15.0. Wait, wait: m = M +5log10(d/10) → d=5 → (5/10)=0.5 → log10(0.5)= -0.301. So m=16.5 + (-1.505)=14.995 ≈15. So apparent magnitude is about 15. Now, considering if there's extinction? The problem doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5, so I think we can assume it's zero. So m=15. Both telescopes can detect it, since 15<16 and 15<17. So Star5 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, and distance is 5 pc. Let me recalculate. M = 16.5. Distance d=5 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) → 16.5 -1.505=14.995. So m=15. No extinction, so apparent mag is 15. So both instruments can see it.

Now let's check which stars can be seen by both. So the stars that have apparent V mag ≤16.

Star1: m=15.5 → yes. So both can see it.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes, both can see it. Because the observed m is 15.5, even though it's affected by extinction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in Star3, the given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but there's extinction. So I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the given m is 15.5, and that's after extinction? Or is it before?

Wait, I think I messed that up. Let me clarify:

In Star3, the problem states: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6.

So the observed apparent magnitude (m_observed) is 15.5. But that's after extinction. Or is the m_observed given, and the extinction is extra?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag." So the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that includes the extinction. So to find the intrinsic or true apparent magnitude, we have to subtract the extinction (A_V). So the true m (without extinction) would be m_true = m_observed - A_V = 15.5 - (3.1 * 0.6) = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

Wait, but wait: the apparent magnitude is what the telescope measures. So if a star is actually at 13.64, but due to extinction, it looks like 15.5. So for detection, the observed m is 15.5. So when a telescope determines whether to observe a star, it looks at the observed m, which is the one they can detect.

So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. So both telescopes can detect it since 15.5 <=16 and 15.5 <=17.

Star4: m_observed is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

Star5: m=15, so both can detect.

Wait, so now, which stars can be detected by both? Let's list them:

Star1: m=15.5 → both.

Star3: m=15.5 → both.

Star5: m=15 → both.

So the possible stars are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Now, looking at the options:

Options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both → possible.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 m=16.5, only ESPRESSO. Star3 can be both. So only Star3 is in both, but the option is Star2 and Star3. So not both can be in both. So option C is not correct.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be in both, Star4 only ESPRESSO.

So the correct options would be those stars that can be detected by both. So stars that have m ≤16.

So possible are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options, only option B (Star3 and Star5) includes two stars that meet the criteria.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the question. It's a multiple-choice, and the options are provided as A to D.

Looking back, the possible pairs:

Which of the options have stars that can be detected by both instruments.

Star3: m_observed=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

So option B is 'Star3 and Star5'. So both can be detected by both spectrographs.

Wait, but what about Star1: m=15.5, which is also ≤16, so can be detected by both. But the options don't have an option that includes Star1 and someone else. Let's look.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → only Star5 is in both, Star4 only ESPRESSO.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 only ESPRESSO.

D) Star1 and Star4 → only Star1 can be both.

So the correct answer would be option B, which includes Star3 and Star5.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check each star's situation.

Star3: m_observed=15.5 → yes, both.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

So both can be detected by both instruments.

Is there any other consideration, like the declination and whether the telescopes can observe them? The question says to disregard pointing limits, so no need to consider that.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, looking back, in Star3's situation, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the extinction is E(B-V)=0.6, so the observed m is 15.5. So that's correct. Star3 is detected by both.

Another thought: in Star3, the extinction is E(B-V), which is a measure of reddening. So when calculating the extinction in V band, it's A_V=3.1*E(B-V). So that's correct.

Wait, another way: if a star's light is absorbed, making it dimmer (higher m). So the observed m is m_true + A_V. So Star3's m_observed is 15.5, which means that without extinction, it would be m_true=15.5 -1.86=13.64. But the observed m is 15.5, which is what the telescope sees. So for detection, the telescope is concerned with the observed m. So yes, 15.5 is within both.

Alternatively, if the question had given the absolute magnitude and distance without extinction, but with extinction, the calculation would be different. But in Star3's case, the problem states the apparent V magnitude, so I think my earlier approach is correct.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m < 17$), while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m < 16$). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude $m \leq 16$ to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - $m = 15.5 \leq 16$, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude $m = 16.5$, distance $d = 5$ pc.  
   - $m = 16.5 > 16$, so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude $m = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - Total absorption in V band: $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36$.  
   - However, the problem states the apparent magnitude $m = 15.5$ already accounts for extinction. Thus, $m = 15.5 \leq 16$, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - Total absorption in V band: $A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: $m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - $m = 16.74 > 16$, so HIRES cannot detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5$ pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
   - $m = 15.0 \leq 16$, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1**, **Star3**, and **Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are correctly paired as being detectable by both instruments.

**Answer: B**
