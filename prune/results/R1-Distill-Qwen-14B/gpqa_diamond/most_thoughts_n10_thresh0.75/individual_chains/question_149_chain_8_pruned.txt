Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a small peptidic compound. Hmm, let me think. So the scenario is that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly correct but has two peaks that both are alpha-protons. They have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So the integral suggests it's one proton, but there are two peaks. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so maybe it's not a splitting due to neighboring protons.

Then the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So the mass is correct, same as expected. But why two peaks with the same mass? Could it be something like a diastereomer or enantiomer? Or maybe something else like a byproduct?

Wait, let's break it down. The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. In an NMR, each proton environment gives a peak. If the same proton is in two different environments, perhaps due to different diastereomers or enantiomers, that would cause two peaks. But if it's a racemic mixture, the enantiomers would have the same NMR peaks because they're mirror images. Wait, no, wait. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because the environment is the same for each proton. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see separate peaks in NMR; the peaks would be the same, and the integral would add up correctly. So Option B, which is enantiomers, might not explain the two NMR peaks.

But wait, the two NMR peaks have similar shifts. If it's diastereomers, they have different physical environments, so their protons would split into different signals. So if there are diastereomers, their alpha protons would have different shifts, but in this case, the shifts are similar. Hmm. Wait, the question says the shifts are similar, but they're from the same alpha proton. So maybe it's isomerism that's causing this.

Another possibility: the two peaks could be due to a diastereomeric mixture. So if the crude compound has two diastereomers, each would have slightly different shifts for the alpha proton, leading to two peaks. But the integrals together add up to 1H, which would make sense if each diastereomer has one
