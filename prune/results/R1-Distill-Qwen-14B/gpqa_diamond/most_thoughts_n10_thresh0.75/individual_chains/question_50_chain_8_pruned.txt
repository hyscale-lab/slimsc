Okay, so I have this problem about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that a colleague has a new quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime and is looking at higher-order loop diagrams. There's a note next to a Feynman diagram with some formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the task is to find out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

I remember that in Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the topology of the diagram and affects the order in terms of perturbation theory. Each loop contributes a factor of the coupling constant and some other terms.

Wait, the general structure when calculating loop integrals often involves factors like (4π)^{d/2} in the denominator, where d is the spacetime dimension. Oh wait, but that's more about the integral measure. Here, the denominator has (4π)^6. Hmm.

Also, I recall that the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated using the formula D = d L - (2I - V), where L is the number of loops, d the dimension, I internal lines, V vertices. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, when you have loop integrals, each loop brings in an integral over d^d k/(2π)^d, and when you regularize, like using dimensional regularization or cutoff, you end up with terms involving (4π)^{L} in the denominator, where L is the number of loops. But wait, sometimes it's (4π)^{L/2} or something like that depending on the method.

Wait, let's think about the overall scaling. Each loop integral typically contributes a factor of 1/(16π²) per loop in four dimensions because the integral over four-momentum gives a denominator with (2π)^4, but after integrating, each loop ends up with a 1/(16π²) factor. So for L loops, you'd have (1/(16π²))^L. Hmm.

Wait, the denominator in the given expression is (4π)^6. Let me compute that. 4π is 4 times pi, so (4π)^6 is (4^6) * (pi^6). But
