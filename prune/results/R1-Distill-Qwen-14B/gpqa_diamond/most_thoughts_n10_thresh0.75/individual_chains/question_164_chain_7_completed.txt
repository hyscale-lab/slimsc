Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question is about determining which system is more massive. Both systems are binary, meaning they have two stars orbiting each other. The problem gives me some data about their eclipses and radial velocities.

Let's see. Both systems exhibit eclipses. The periods are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year.

Then there's the spectroscopic data. For system_1, the stars have radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity amplitude refers to how much each star moves toward or away from us during their orbit. The larger the amplitude, the more massive the other star, I think. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity if the masses are different? Or wait, no, it's about the masses and the center of mass. So the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so its velocity would be smaller. Right.

Wait, let me get this straight. In a binary system, both stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, so its orbit is smaller. So the velocity of each star depends on their mass. The less massive star has to move faster to balance the system.

So the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude is given by some formula. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion and the system's parameters. The formula I think is something like:

K = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is the inverse ratio of their masses. So, K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 (since they have to balance each other's momentum). So K1 = (M2/M1) * K2. So if K1 is the RV of star 1, and K2 is the RV of star 2, then K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Yes, that's it. So in system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So K1 =10, K2=5. So 10/5=2= M2/M1. So M2 = 2*M1. So the masses are in a 2:1 ratio. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Wait, no, wait. Because K1 is for star 1, and K2 is for star 2. The ratio is K1/K2 = M2/M1. So in system_1, 10/5=2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1. So the masses are M1 and 2 M1. So the total mass is 3 M1.

Similarly, system_2 has RV amplitudes of 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10. K1/K2 =15/10=3/2 = M2/M1. So M2 = (3/2) M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star is which? I think it doesn't matter because the ratio would still hold. Let's say in system_2, the two stars have masses M1' and M2', and their RVs are 15 and 10. So K1' =15, K2'=10. So K1'/K2' = M2'/M1' = 15/10=3/2. So M2' = (3/2) M1'. So the total mass is M1' + M2' = M1' + 1.5 M1' = 2.5 M1'.

Wait, but the systems are separate, so their masses are independent. So in system_1, the total mass is 3 M1, and in system_2, it's 2.5 M1' (where M1' is the mass of the first star in system_2). But I think I need to relate the masses across the two systems.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the formula for the orbital period in terms of the masses and the separation. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a³ (M1 + M2))², but I might be mixing up the exact form.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of binary stars is often written as (P² G) / (4 π²) = a³ (M1 + M2) / M_sun, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is using the mass function, but that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass ratio and the total mass. Let's think about the formula for K. From what I recall, the RV semi-amplitude for each star can be given by:

K1 = (v) = (2 π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / [ (P (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) ) ]

But I'm not certain about the exact formula. Alternatively, the formula I think is:

K1 = [ (G P ) / (2 π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the fact that the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Which I think is correct.

So for each system, we can find the mass ratio, then express each system's total mass, and then find the ratio of the total masses.

But then, how do the orbital periods factor in? Because the velocity and the period must relate to the size of the orbit, which in turn relates to the masses.

Wait, the orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system. So for each system, the period is given, and the RV amplitudes give the mass ratio.

But the mass function would involve the period, velocity, and the inclination angle (sin i), but I don't know the inclination. Wait, but the question says to "consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars." So perhaps we're assuming that the inclination is the same for both systems, or maybe it's not necessary because it would cancel out.

Alternatively, maybe the mass ratio can be determined without knowing the inclination, but the absolute masses would require knowing the inclination.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of the total masses of the two systems. Maybe the inclination angles are the same for both systems, or perhaps it's not needed because it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Let me think again. For each system, the RV amplitudes are given. So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So the mass ratio is K1/K2=10/5=2. So M2/M1=2. So M2=2*M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2=3*M1.

For system_2, K1=15, K2=10. K1/K2=15/10=3/2. So M2/M1=3/2. So M2=(3/2) M1'. So total mass is M1' + M2' = (5/2) M1'.

Wait, but then how do the periods factor into this? Because the period is the same for both stars in the system. But the periods are different between system_1 and system_2. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

Wait, perhaps the orbital separation is related to the period and the total mass via Kepler's third law. But without knowing the separation or the actual masses, how can we determine the total mass ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the mass function or another approach can relate the RV amplitudes, the period, and the masses.

Wait, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K1^3 P) / (2 π G)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is:

f(M) = ( (K)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Which is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But that's getting complicated because it involves the inclination angle. Since we don't know the inclination, perhaps we can assume that the inclination is the same for both systems. But the question doesn't specify that, so that might not be a valid assumption.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So perhaps the ratio can be determined without knowing the exact inclinations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate the velocities and the periods to the masses.

Wait, for a binary system, each star's velocity is related to the orbital period and the size of their orbit. The circular velocity is v = 2π a / P, where a is the radius of the orbit.

But for each star, a1 and a2 are their respective orbital radii. The center of mass requires M1 a1 = M2 a2. So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the two stars.

So the velocities for each star are v1 = (2 π a1) / P and v2 = (2 π a2) / P.

So v1 = (2 π M2 a_total ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

Similarly, v2 = (2 π M1 a_total ) / (P (M1 + M2)) )

So the ratio v1/v2 = M2/M1.

Which matches what I thought earlier. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

But how does the orbital period come into play with determining the mass?

Wait, the separation a_total can be determined from Kepler's third law. Kepler's third law in binary systems is given by:

P² = (4 π² G )⁻¹ * (a_total^3 (M1 + M2)) )

Wait, the exact form is P² = (4 π² G )⁻¹ * (4 π² a_total³ (M1 + M2) ) / (G )

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The formula is:

P² = (4 π²) * (a_total^3) / ( G (M1 + M2) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The general form is P^2 = (4π²/G(M1+M2)) ) * a^3, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Wait, but the problem is I don't know a for each system. So how can I relate the masses to the period and the velocities?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the masses can be found from the velocity amplitudes, and then the ratio of the total masses can be determined using the orbital periods.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. The RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star in the line of sight. For each star, K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should write the expression for the mass function.

The mass function for a binary system is:

f(M) = (K1^3 P) / (2 π G )

But f(M) is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing the inclination angle, we can't find the absolute masses. However, since both systems are observed with the same inclination (maybe), we can find the ratio of their masses from the ratio of their mass functions.

Wait, but the problem gives different periods for the two systems. So let's try to think of it this way.

For each system, write the mass function.

For system_1:

f1 = (K1_1^3 * P1) / (2 π G )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (K1_2^3 * P2) / (2 π G )

But wait, what's K1_1? In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. But I'm not sure which one is K1 and which is K2. Maybe it doesn't matter because the mass function for each star would give the same result when considering the mass ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each system's mass function depends on their respective velocities and periods.

Wait, the mass function for each star in the system is the same. Because both stars are orbiting each other, so their individual mass functions would relate to the same total mass.

Wait, but for each star, their mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P sin^3 i) / (2 π G )

But again, without knowing sin i, it's tricky. Unless we can relate the mass functions across the two systems.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass ratio of the two systems by considering their mass functions and the ratio of their periods.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the ratio of the masses, and then see how the period affects the mass via Kepler's law.

Wait, but let me think about the formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the mass.

The formula is:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / [ (P (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) ) ]

But I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude can be expressed as:

K = [ (G P) / (2 π c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) )

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again: for each star, the velocity is given by the size of their orbit divided by the period. So v = 2 π a / P.

But a is the radius of the orbit for that star, which is related to the total separation a_total by a = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total for star 1, and a = (M1/(M1+M2)) a_total for star 2.

So, for star 1: v1 = 2 π a1 / P.

Similarly, v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

But a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a_total.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 π² G )⁻¹ a_total³ (M1 + M2) )

Wait, the correct form of Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

P² = (4 π² / G (M1 + M2)) ) a_total³

So, a_total^3 = G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² )

So a_total = [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a1:

a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

So v1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π/(P) * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) * (M2/(M1 + M2))

Simplifying:

v1 = 2 π/(P) * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) * (M2/(M1 + M2) )

Let me compute each part.

First, [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

That's equal to (G (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) * (P²)^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

So:

v1 = (2 π / P) * [ (G (M1 + M2))^(1/3) (P^2)^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * (M2/(M1 + M2) )

Simplify inside the brackets:

G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

So:

v1 = (2 π / P ) * [ G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) ] * (M2/(M1 + M2) )

Now, let's collect the terms.

Multiply 2 π by the numerator:

2 π * G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) M2 ) / [ 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) (M1 + M2) P ]

Simplify denominator:

4^(1/3) is (2^2)^(1/3)= 2^(2/3)

π^(2/3) comes from the denominator.

And the P is from the denominator as well.

So denominator: 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) P

So numerator: 2 π G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) M2

So putting it all together:

v1 = [ 2 π G^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(1/3) P^(2/3) M2 ] / [ 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) (M1 + M2) P ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2 / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3)

π / π^(2/3) ) = π^(1 - 2/3) )= π^(1/3 )

G^(1/3) stays.

(M1 + M2)^(1/3) / (M1 + M2) ) = (M1 + M2)^(-2/3 )

P^(2/3) / P ) = P^(-1/3 )

And M2 remains.

So now, v1 = [ 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) * G^(1/3) * (M1 + M2)^(-2/3) ) * P^(-1/3 ) * M2 ]

So,

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2) / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ]

Which is:

v1 = [ (2 π G ) / (P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M2) / (M1 + M2)^(2/3 )

Simplify the exponents:

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3) * M2 / (M1 + M2)^(2/3 )

Which can be written as:

v1 = ( (2 π G ) / P )^(1/3 ) * ( M2 ) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3 )

Hmm, I think that's about as far as I can simplify.

But wait, for a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity. So the more massive star has a smaller K.

Wait, so in system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So 10 is bigger than 5. So the star with K=10 is less massive than the other, because it's moving faster. Because the less massive star has to orbit more quickly.

So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1 / K2 = 10/5=2.

So M2 = 2 M1.

So mass ratio q is 2, so total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

For system_2, the RVs are 15 and 10. So K1=15, K2=10.

So the mass ratio q2 = K1/K2 =15/10=3/2.

So M2' = (3/2) M1'

So total mass is M1' + M2' = (5/2) M1'.

Now, how to compare the total masses of system_1 and system_2.

Wait, but I need to relate the periods. Because the period affects the velocity via the formula, but without knowing the actual masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses.

The formula for the velocity is v = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But for system_1, with M2 = 2 M1, and P1 = 2 years. So let's compute v1 for system_1.

v1 (system_1) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (2 M1) / ( (3 M1)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2, M2' = (3/2) M1', P2 =1 year.

v1 (system_2) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (3/2 M1') / ( (5/2 M1') )^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3 )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me think about the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

M_total1 = 3 M1.

For system_2:

M_total2 = (5/2) M1'.

We need to find M_total1 / M_total2.

So we need to find the ratio (3 M1) / ( (5/2) M1' ) = (6 M1)/(5 M1').

So if I can find M1/M1', that would give the ratio.

How can I find M1 and M1'?

Wait, perhaps using the velocity formula.

For system_1, star 1's velocity is K1=10 km/s:

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (2 M1) / ( (3 M1)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2, star 1's velocity is K1=15 km/s:

v1' = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (3/2 M1') / ( (5/2 M1')^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) )

So the ratio v1 / v1' equals [10] / [15] = 2/3.

Wait, but let's compute v1 and v1' based on the formula.

Let me compute the expressions for v1 and v1':

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (2 M1) / [ (3 M1)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

(3 M1)^(2/3) = 3^(2/3) M1^(2/3 )

(2)^(1/3) is 2^(1/3 )

So denominator is 3^(2/3) M1^(2/3) 2^(1/3 )

So v1 is:

(2 π G )^(1/3) * 2 M1 / [ 3^(2/3) M1^(2/3) 2^(1/3) ) ]

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * 2 M1 / [3^(2/3) 2^(1/3) M1^(2/3) ) ]

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * [ 2 / 2^(1/3) ) ] * [ M1 / M1^(2/3) ) ] / 3^(2/3)

Simplify 2 / 2^(1/3) = 2^(2/3 )

M1 / M1^(2/3 ) = M1^(1/3 )

So,

v1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * 2^(2/3) * M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3 )

= [ 2 π G * 2^2 / 3^2 ]^(1/3) ) * M1^(1/3 )

Wait,

2^(2/3) = (2^2 )^(1/3 )=4^(1/3 )

3^(2/3 )= (3^2 )^(1/3 )=9^(1/3 )

So,

v1 = [ (2 pi G ) * (4) / 9 ) ]^(1/3 ) * (M1)^(1/3 )

Similarly, for system_2, v1' is:

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * (3/2 M1' ) / [ (5/2 M1' )^(2/3) * 1^(1/3) ) ]

Denominator:

(5/2 M1' )^(2/3 ) = (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1'^(2/3 )

So,

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * (3/2 M1' ) / [ (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1'^(2/3 ) ) ]

Simplify:

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * (3/2) M1' / [ (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1'^(2/3 ) )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 3/(2) * (M1')^(1 - 2/3) ) / (5/2 )^(2/3 )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 3/(2) * M1'^(1/3 ) / (5/2 )^(2/3 )

Hmm, let's compute (5/2 )^(2/3 ) = (5^2)/(2^2 ) )^(1/3 )= (25/4 )^(1/3 )

So,

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 3/(2) * M1'^(1/3 ) / (25/4 )^(1/3 )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * [ 3/(2) * (4/25 )^(1/3 ) ] * M1'^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio v1/v1' and set it equal to 10/15 = 2/3.

So,

v1 / v1' = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 2^(2/3) * M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * (3/2 ) * M1'^(1/3) / (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ 2^(2/3) / 3^(2/3) ) * M1^(1/3) ] / [ (3/2 ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 ) ) * M1'^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should compute each part:

The ratio is:

[ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (2^(2/3) * M1^(1/3) ) / 3^(2/3) ) ] 
divided by
[ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (3/2 ) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) * M1'^(1/3) ) ]

The (2 pi G )^(1/3) cancels out.

So,

= [ 2^(2/3) M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3/2 ) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1'^(1/3 ) ]

Let me write this as:

= [ 2^(2/3) / 3^(2/3) ) * M1^(1/3) ] * [ 1 / (3/2) ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 ) ) * (M1')^(-1/3) ]

Which is:

= [ (2^(2/3) ) / (3^(2/3) ) ) * (2/3) ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 ) ) ] * [ M1^(1/3) / M1'^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can simplify the constants.

Let me compute the constants:

First, 2^(2/3) * (2/3) ) = 2^(2/3) * 2 /3 = (2^(5/3) ) /3.

Then, (2/5 )^(2/3 ) = 2^(2/3) /5^(2/3 )

So,

constants = (2^(5/3) /3 ) * (2^(2/3) ) /5^(2/3 ) ) / 3^(2/3 )

Wait, no. Wait, the expression is:

(2^(2/3) / 3^(2/3)) ) * (2/3) ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 )

Which is:

2^(2/3) / 3^(2/3) * 2/(3) * 2^(2/3) / 5^(2/3 )

Multiply all the 2 exponents: 2^(2/3 +2/3 )=2^(4/3 )

3 exponents: 3^(2/3 +1 )=3^(5/3 )

5 exponents:5^(2/3 )

So,

constants = 2^(4/3) / (3^(5/3) 5^(2/3) )

So,

v1/v1' = [ 2^(4/3) / (3^(5/3) 5^(2/3) ) ) ] * (M1 / M1' )^(1/3 )

But we know that v1/v1' = 10/15= 2/3.

So,

2^(4/3) / (3^(5/3) 5^(2/3) )) * (M1/M1' )^(1/3 ) = 2/3.

Let me compute the constants:

2^(4/3) = cube root(16) ≈2.5198

3^(5/3 )= cube root(243) ≈6.24

5^(2/3 )= cube root(25 )≈2.924

So numerator: 2.5198

Denominator:6.24 * 2.924 ≈ 18.24

So 2.5198 / 18.24 ≈0.138.

So,

0.138 * (M1/M1' )^(1/3 ) = 2/3 ≈0.6667.

So,

(M1/M1' )^(1/3 ) = 0.6667 / 0.138 ≈4.827.

So,

M1/M1' = (4.827)^3 ≈ 111.3.

Wait, that's a big number. But let's check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the constants.

Let me recompute the constants:

2^(4/3) = (2^(1/3))^4 ≈ (1.2599)^4 ≈ 2.5198.

3^(5/3) = (3^(1/3))^5 ≈ (1.4422)^5 ≈ 1.4422 * 1.4422 = 2.0801, squared is ~4.325, multiplied by 1.4422 again is about 6.24.

5^(2/3 )= (5^(1/3))²≈ (1.7100)^2≈2.924.

So denominator: 6.24 * 2.924 ≈ 18.25. So 2.5198 /18.25≈0.138.

So,

0.138 * (M1/M1' )^(1/3 ) = 0.6667.

So,

(M1/M1' )^(1/3 )=0.6667 / 0.138 ≈4.827.

So,

M1/M1' = (4.827)^3.

Compute 4.827^3:

4.827 *4.827 = approx 23.3 (since 4.8^2=23.04, 4.827^2≈23.3)

23.3 *4.827 ≈ 112.5.

So,

M1/M1' ≈113.

Wait, that's a huge ratio. So M1 is about 113 times M1'.

But that seems way too large. Did I make a mistake in the ratio setup?

Wait, perhaps I got the velocities reversed. Because in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5, meaning the more massive star has the smaller velocity. So perhaps in system_1, the star with K=5 is the more massive one. Wait, earlier I thought K1=10, K2=5. So the star with K=10 is less massive than the star with K=5, because it's moving faster.

Wait, but in the system, the mass ratio is M2/M1= K1/K2. So if K1 is for the first star (maybe the primary), M2= K1/K2 * M1.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that for system_1, the two Ks are K1=10 and K2=5. So the mass ratio is M2/M1=10/5=2.

Thus, M2=2 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10. Mass ratio M2/M1=15/10=3/2.

So M2= (3/2) M1.

But when I calculated the velocities, perhaps I should have used the correct M for each system.

Wait, but when I substituted into the velocity formula, I used M1 and M2 for each system. So for system_1, the formula for v1 (the star with K=10) would be:

v1 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2) / [ (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) ) ]

Since M2=2 M1, M1 + M2=3 M1.

So,

v1 (system_1) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2 M1 / [ (3 M1 )^(2/3) * (2 )^(1/3) ) ]

Similarly, in system_2, the star with K=15 has v1' =15.

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M2' / [ (M1' + M2'^2/3 ) * P2^(1/3) ) ]

M2' = (3/2) M1', M1' + M2' = (5/2 ) M1'

P2 =1 year.

So,

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (3/2 M1' ) / [ (5/2 M1' )^(2/3) * 1^(1/3) ) ]

So, putting it all together,

v1 (system_1) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2 M1 / [ (3 M1 )^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

= (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2 M1 / [ 3^(2/3) M1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

= (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2^(1 - 1/3) * M1^(1 - 2/3) / 3^(2/3 )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2^(2/3) * M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3 )

Similarly, for system_2:

v1' = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (3/2 M1' ) / [ (5/2 M1' )^(2/3) ) ]

= (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (3/2 ) * M1' / ( (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1'^(2/3) )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 3/(2) * M1'^(1 - 2/3) ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3 ) )

= (2 pi G )^(1/3 ) * 3/(2) * M1'^(1/3 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3 ) )

Now, the ratio v1/v1' = [ ... ] as before.

But perhaps I should write the ratio as:

v1 / v1' = [ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * 2^(2/3) M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (3/2) M1'^(1/3) / (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) ]

The (2 pi G )^(1/3) terms cancel.

So,

v1/v1' = [ 2^(2/3) M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3/2) M1'^(1/3) / (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) ]

= [ 2^(2/3) M1^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ] * [ (5/2 )^(2/3 ) / (3/2 ) M1'^(1/3) ) ]

= [ 2^(2/3) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) / (3^(2/3) * 3/2 ) ) ] * [ M1^(1/3) / M1'^(1/3) ) ]

Let me compute each part.

Compute 2^(2/3) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) = [2 *5/2 ]^(2/3 ) =5^(2/3 )

3^(2/3) * 3/2 = 3^(2/3 + 1 ) * (2)^(-1 )

= 3^(5/3 ) * 2^(-1 )

So,

v1/v1' = [5^(2/3 ) / (3^(5/3 ) * 2^(-1 )) ) ] * [ M1/(M1') ]^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me re-express that.

[2^(2/3) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ] = [ (2 *5/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) =5^(2/3 )

Similarly, denominator:

3^(2/3 ) * (3/2 ) = 3^(2/3 + 1 ) * 2^(-1 ) =3^(5/3 ) * 2^(-1 )

So,

the constants become:

5^(2/3 ) / (3^(5/3 ) * 2^(-1 )) ) 

Which is 5^(2/3 ) *2 / 3^(5/3 )

So,

v1/v1' = [5^(2/3 ) * 2 / 3^(5/3 ) ] * ( M1 / M1' )^(1/3 )

We know that v1=10, v1'=15. So their ratio is 10/15 = 2/3.

So,

[5^(2/3 ) * 2 / 3^(5/3 ) ] * ( M1 / M1' )^(1/3 ) = 2/3.

Let me compute the constants:

5^(2/3 )≈2.924, 3^(5/3 )≈6.24, 2 is 2.

So,

(2.924 * 2 ) / 6.24 ≈5.848 /6.24≈0.937.

So,

0.937 * (M1 / M1' )^(1/3 ) = 2/3 ≈0.6667.

So,

(M1/M1' )^(1/3 ) = 0.6667 / 0.937 ≈0.711.

So,

M1/M1' = (0.711)^3 ≈0.36.

So,

M1 ≈0.36 M1'.

Now, we want to find the ratio of total masses: M_total1 / M_total2 = [3 M1 ] / [ (5/2 ) M1' ].

Substituting M1 = 0.36 M1' :

= [3 * 0.36 M1' ] / [ (5/2 ) M1' ]

= (1.08 M1') / (2.5 M1' )

= 1.08 /2.5 =0.432.

So, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. Which is approximately 0.4, which is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.4

B) ~ 0.6

C) ~ 1.2

D) ~ 0.7

So the answer would be approximately 0.4, option A.


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data about the binary star systems. Both systems exhibit eclipses, with orbital periods of 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Spectroscopic observations provide radial velocity (RV) amplitudes: system_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s, while system_2 has amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The goal is to compare the total masses of the two systems.

### Key Relationships:
1. **Mass Ratio from RV Amplitudes**:  
   The ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their mass ratio. For system_1, \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
   \]  
   Thus, \( M_2 = 2M_1 \). The total mass of system_1 is:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 2M_1 = 3M_1
   \]

   For system_2, \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), so:  
   \[
   \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{15}{10} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]  
   Thus, \( M_2 = \frac{3}{2}M_1 \). The total mass of system_2 is:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + \frac{3}{2}M_1 = \frac{5}{2}M_1
   \]

2. **Mass Ratio Between the Systems**:  
   To compare the total masses of the two systems, we calculate the ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3M_1}{\frac{5}{2}M_1'} = \frac{6M_1}{5M_1'}
   \]  
   Here, \( M_1 \) and \( M_1' \) are the masses of the first stars in system_1 and system_2, respectively. To determine \( \frac{M_1}{M_1'} \), we use the relationship between the RV amplitudes, periods, and masses derived from Kepler's laws and the velocity formula. After detailed calculations, it is found that:  
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_1'} \approx 0.36
   \]  
   Substituting this into the mass ratio:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{6 \times 0.36}{5} \approx 0.432
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. The closest option to this value is **A) ~ 0.4**.
