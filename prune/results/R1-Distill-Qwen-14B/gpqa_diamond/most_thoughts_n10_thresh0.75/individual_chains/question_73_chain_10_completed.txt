Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving different relative speeds and total energies.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, astronaut 1 is moving faster, so their relative speed from astronaut 2's perspective should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c -0.5c =0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 =0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c when rounded, which fits with option C or D.

Now for the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut's energy should be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So E_total = E1 + E2.

Calculating gamma for each. For the first astronaut, moving at 0.6c: gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) =1/0.8 =1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * m * c² * (his mass is 2m) → Wait, wait. Wait a second, his mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c². Similarly, E2 = gamma2 * (3m) c².

Wait, let me compute gamma for each. For 0.6c: (0.6)^2 is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut moving at 0.5c: gamma2 is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². And option D is v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc². So the relative speed calculation I did earlier gave approximately 0.14c, which matches both C and D.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the relative speed calculation? Let me recalculate that. (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²) → (0.6c -0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) → (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So yes, the relative speed is 0.14c, so options C and D have this.

So for the total energy, it's about 5.96 mc², so option C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the energies. Oh wait, the first astronaut is 2m, so 2m * gamma1 c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c². The second is 3m * 1.1547 c² → 3 *1.1547 is about 3.4641, so 3.4641 m c². Summing these: 2.5 +3.4641 is 5.9641 m c², so approximately 5.96 mc² as in option C. So the correct answer is option C. But wait, looking at the options, option D has E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C is better.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(v = 0.6c\), mass \(2m\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(v = 0.5c\), mass \(3m\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
- The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches options C and D.
- The total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\), which matches option C.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
