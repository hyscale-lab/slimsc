Okay, so I have this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with CMB photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. I remember that high-energy photons like gamma-rays can interact with the CMB, which is this background radiation filling the universe. 

The process given is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs: γ + γ → e+ + e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, I think I need to find the gamma-ray energy where this interaction becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

Wait, I remember something about the optical depth in particle physics. Optical depth determines the probability of a photon interacting. If the optical depth is much greater than 1, interactions are very likely. So for a gamma-ray, if the optical depth due to CMB interactions is large, the gamma-ray would annihilate quickly, limiting its lifetime.

The formula for the optical depth (τ) for this process is probably something like τ = n_γ * σ * L, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section for the annihilation, and L is the length over which the gamma-ray travels.

But I'm not exactly sure about the cross-section formula for pair production via two-photon collisions. I think for high-energy photons, the cross-section increases with energy. Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is proportional to (E_γ)^2 (E_photon)^2 divided by something... Oh right, the cross-section σ is approximately σ ≈ (4/3) * π * α^2 * (m_e^2) / (s) where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, maybe that's for a different process. Alternatively, I've heard that the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is about σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (s)) * (m_e^4), where s = (E1 + E2)^2 when E1 and E2 are the energies in the center-of-mass frame. Or wait, maybe it's s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2. 

Wait, but the CMB photons have a known energy. The average energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So for a gamma-ray of energy E, the center-of-mass energy squared would be s = (E + E_cmb)^2. But for high-energy gammas, E_cmb is negligible compared to E, so s ≈ (E)^2. So maybe the cross-section σ is roughly proportional to 1/s, which is 1/E^2.

But I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the photon density. The number density of CMB photons is about n_γ ≈ 411 photons per cm^3. Wait, I think the CMB photon density is about 411 cm^-3. Let me confirm: the CMB temperature is around 2.7 K. Using the formula for photon density in a blackbody, n_γ = 8π/(3h^3 c^3) * (k_B T)^3. Plugging in the numbers—k_B is Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, T is 2.7 K. But maybe I don't need to calculate it exactly since the problem states average photon energy as 1e-3 eV, so perhaps the exact number isn't needed.

So, the cross-section is σ ≈ (something) * (m_e^2) / E^2. And the number density is about 4e1 cm^-3 perhaps? Wait, I think the CMB photon density is about 411 cm^-3, which is about 4e2 photons per cubic meter? Wait, no, 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3. So 411 cm^-3 is 411e6 m^-3. Wait, but maybe I should just use the number as n_γ ≈ 1e8 m^-3? Or perhaps I should look it up. Hmm, but the problem gives the average photon energy as 1e-3 eV. Since they're giving an average energy, maybe I can find the photon density using that.

Wait, the average photon energy in the CMB is given. The CMB is a blackbody at T≈2.7 K. The average photon energy is around 2.7 k_B T. Wait, no, the average energy for a photon in a blackbody is actually given by u = 3k_B T^2 / (h c), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the average energy per photon can be found from the photon distribution. The average energy <E> is given by <E> = (2 k_B T) / (e^{(h c)/(k
