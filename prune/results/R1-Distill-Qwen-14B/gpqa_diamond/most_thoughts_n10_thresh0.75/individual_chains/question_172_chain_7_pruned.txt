Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about stellar atmospheres and LTE, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Oh right, LTE means that in the photosphere, the gas behaves pretty much like a blackbody in thermal equilibrium, so the Saha equation applies for ionization and excitation.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They're asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, I think the key here is the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being proportional to the exponential of the energy difference over (k*T), but wait, since higher energy levels have lower populations, the ratio should be N2/N1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

Wait, but in this case, the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So let me think. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 being higher than E1 by delta E = 1.38e-23 J. In star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state (E2) is twice that of star_2. But wait, actually, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so maybe the ratio is N2/N1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited..." So I think that means that the excitation level is higher. So perhaps the population ratio N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, or wait, maybe the excitation is higher in star_1, so the ratio is higher.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 > E1. So if star_1's ratio is twice star_2's ratio, then:

N2/N1 for star_1 is 2*(N2/N1 for star_2)
