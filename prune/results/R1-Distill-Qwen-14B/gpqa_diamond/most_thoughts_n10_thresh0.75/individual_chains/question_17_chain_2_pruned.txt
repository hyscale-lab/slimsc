Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem states that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, so that's the concentration of the complex itself, right? And the K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, so that's the formation constant, Kf or sometimes written as KCa-EDTA.

I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA form the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the K would be [CaEDTA^2−] divided by ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution is just the complex, so initially, we have 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−. Since the K is so large (5x10^10), that suggests the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low.

Wait, but how do I find the concentration of Ca²+ in solution? I think I need to set up an ICE table or use the approximation because K is so large. But maybe it's easier to think about it in terms of the formation constant expression.

Let me write down what I know:

Initial concentration of CaEDTA complex (C) = 0.02 M.

When it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let's say the change is x, so:

At equilibrium,
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is going to be tiny because K is large)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So plugging into the K expression:
K = ([CaEDTA²−])/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

So setting up the equation:
0.02 / x^2 = 5e10.

Solving for x²:
x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10 → Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Wait, no. Let me compute that again.

0.02 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Oh, no, wait. Let me calculate the square root properly.

Wait, 4e-13 is the same as 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 (since 1e-12 is (1e-6)^2, so 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2). So x is 2e-6.5 M. What's 1e-6.5
