Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π) right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So let me write down what S looks like.

S matrix:
[ 0  -i ]
[i   0 ]

So Ay = c * S. c is h/(4π), so substituting that in, Ay would be [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ], [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ].

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, but the question isn't asking for the exact calculation. It's asking which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, wait, eigenvalues for spin-½ particles like a muon (which I think is a lepton, hence spin ½) the eigenvalues for the angular momentum components are ± ħ/2. Oh wait, because for spin, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But wait, the operator here is Ay. So let's think about the structure.

Wait, S is a Pauli matrix, right? Because S looks like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So S has eigenvalues ±1. Then Ay = c * S. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1). Since c is h/(4π), that would make the eigenvalues ±h/(4π). But wait, wait a second. Let me check: Planck's constant h is related to ħ (h-bar) by ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2.

Oh! So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any option that talks about the imaginary part of the eigenvalues being non-zero must be wrong. So looking at the options
