Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to pick the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that acid catalyzed reactions often involve things like aldehydes or ketones, maybe some kind of alkylation. Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidene group attached. Cyclohexylidene sounds like a cyclohexene ring, so maybe some kind of addition across a double bond?

Wait, but wait. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the structure would have a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. So maybe it's an alkylation where the cyclohexane is attached via a methylene group (the -CH2- part) and has a double bond, like a cyclohexene.

Let me think about possible reactions. Oh! Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply here. Wait, another possibility: perhaps a Baylis-Hillman reaction? Or maybe it's an aldehyde undergoing some kind of addition
