Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs, so 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right, because the charges are all the same sign, they'll repel each other, so the potential energy should be positive, I think.

Wait, wait. The system's total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for an isolated system, we have to consider all possible pairs.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other twelve are at 2 meters from P. So, each of the twelve charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. Then, among themselves, the twelve are each 2 meters apart from P, but what about their distance from each other? Oh, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, maybe I should assume that the twelve are all at the same point, but that seems odd because if they're at the same point, their mutual distance would be zero, which would make the potential energy approach infinity. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe the twelve are placed in such a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances vary. But without knowing the exact positions, perhaps the problem is assuming that each of the twelve is at a distance of 2 meters from P, and their mutual distances are such that they form some symmetric arrangement. Oh wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the potential between the 13th charge and each of the twelve, and not the potential between the twelve themselves. Hmm.

But wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps I should consider all possible interactions. But if the twelve are each at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified, maybe the problem is only considering the potential between each of
