Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that, so 2e each.

The problem says that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, okay.

Wait, so I'm trying to remember about electric potential energy. I think the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Right?

But wait, since there are multiple charges, I guess I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair. Oh, because each charge interacts with every other charge. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from the fixed charge.

Wait, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because the problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions matter. So I think the total potential energy is the sum of the energy between the fixed charge and each of the 1
