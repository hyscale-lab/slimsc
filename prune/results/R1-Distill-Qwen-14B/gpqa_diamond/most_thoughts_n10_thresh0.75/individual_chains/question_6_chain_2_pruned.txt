Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, so it's a function of r and θ. I remember that in two-dimensional polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be split into radial and angular parts, especially if it's separable. 

Wait, let me rewrite the potential to see if it can be expressed more simply. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out (k r²/ 2) from both terms. Oh, wait, because (1/2)k r² is (k r²/2)(1), and the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which is (k r²/2)(3 cos²θ). So combining them, V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, maybe I can express this potential in terms of a new variable or even recognize it as a known potential. Another approach is to separate the radial and angular parts. Wait, the potential is actually dependent on cos²θ, so perhaps I can use a trigonometric identity to simplify it. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that inside the brackets. 1 plus 3*(1/2) is 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. Then, 3*(cos2θ)/2 is (3/2) cos2θ. So, the expression becomes (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Wait, but maybe I should think about this in terms of effective potentials or see if it's a harmonic oscillator in some transformed coordinates. Another idea: perhaps express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates, but that might complicate things.

Wait, let me consider the form of the potential. The general form for a two-dimensional potential
