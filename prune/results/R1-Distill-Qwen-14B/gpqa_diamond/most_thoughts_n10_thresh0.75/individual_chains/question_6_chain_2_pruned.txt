Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem states that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in two dimensions, when dealing with potentials, it's helpful to use polar coordinates because of the symmetry. The potential here seems to have a part that's radial and another that's angular, depending on cos²θ. 

Wait, let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions because a 2D harmonic oscillator would have V(r) proportional to r². But wait, no, that's in Cartesian coordinates, but in polar coordinates, maybe it's a bit different.

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. The second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1/2) (1 + cos2θ) ) which is (3k r²/4)(1 + cos2θ). 

So putting it all together, the potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3k/4) r² [1 + cos2θ].

Let me combine the terms. The first term is (1/2)kr², and the second has (3k/4) r². So adding the constants: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4 kr². And then the angular part is (3k/4) r² cos2θ. So:

V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3k/4) r² cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not be the most useful way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider it as a sum of two different potentials. Wait, maybe this can be rewritten in terms of some effective radial part and an angular part.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, when you have a potential that depends on r and θ, sometimes you can separate the variables. So maybe the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the radial and angular parts.

The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ).

In polar coordinates, the momentum squared is p² = -ħ² ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + (1/(r²)) (∂²/∂θ²) ).

So, substituting into the Hamiltonian:

H = [ - (ħ²)/(2m r²) ∂²/∂θ² + (ħ²)/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) ] + (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ.

Wait, but the potential can perhaps be rewritten in terms of a radial part and an angular part. Let's look again:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

I can factor out kr²:

V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, that's another way to write it. Now, 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ can be simplified. Using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

So, 1/2 + (3/2) * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. 

1/2 is 4/8. 

(3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)(1 + cos2θ) = 3/4 + 3/4 cos2θ.

Adding that to the 1/2 (which is 2/4), gives (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4
