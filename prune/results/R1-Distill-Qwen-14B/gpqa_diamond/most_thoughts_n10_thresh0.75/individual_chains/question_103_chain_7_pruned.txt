Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options (A, B, C, D), each with a series of seven reaction steps. I need to figure out which sequence is correct.

Let me first try to visualize the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are a bromine at the 3-position and a nitro group at the 5-position. Alternatively, numbering the ring could be done such that the ketone is at position 1, but wait, no, the benzene is attached to the ketone. So actually, the benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment of the ketone.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the substituents' positions are relative to the ketone. So the ketone is attached to the benzene ring at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the substituents are at meta and para positions relative to each other? Let me draw this out.

The benzene ring has the ketone (CH2CO-) attached at one position, then moving around the ring, the next substituent is bromine (position 3) and the next is nitro (position 5). Alternatively, perhaps when numbering, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the substituents. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a ketone (from ethan-1-one), a bromine, and a nitro group. The ketone is in position 1; then the bromine is in position 3, and the nitro in position 5. So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, no, the ketone is attached to the benzene as a substituent. So the benzene has the ketone group
