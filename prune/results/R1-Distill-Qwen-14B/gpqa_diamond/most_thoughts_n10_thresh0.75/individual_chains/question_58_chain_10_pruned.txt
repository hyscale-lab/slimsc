Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I need to remember what regularization means. From what I recall, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the mathematics manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities.

So each of these theories, except maybe one, probably requires regularization when dealing with high energies or short distances. I need to figure out which one doesn't.

Starting with the options:

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories usually don't have the same issues as quantum ones because they don't involve the same kind of infinities. Wait, but wait a second. In classical electromagnetism, you can have things like infinite charge density at a point charge, like the case of a charged point particle. But I'm not sure if that's considered a divergence that requires regularization. In quantum terms, regularization is a quantum field theory thing. Since classical E&M isn't a quantum theory, maybe it doesn't require regularization in the same sense. Or perhaps the question is considering whether the theory itself, when treated quantum mechanically, requires regularization. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the theories as physical theories—so perhaps it's about the quantum versions. Because without quantum considerations, classical theories don't really deal with divergences in the same way. For example, in classical electromagnetism, you can have issues like the self-energy of a charge, but those are more like mathematical problems rather than requiring regularization techniques. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So perhaps the correct answer is D, because classical E&M is a non-quantum theory, and regularization is a quantum field theory method. Then again, quantum electrodynamics (QED) is option C, which is a quantum theory. So maybe D is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a quantum field theory dealing with the strong force. It definitely requires regularization because of the divergences in loop calculations. Same with Quantum Electrodynamics (Q
