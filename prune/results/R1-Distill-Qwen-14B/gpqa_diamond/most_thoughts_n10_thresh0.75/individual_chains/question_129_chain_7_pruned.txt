Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form E. There are also some hints provided, so I should definitely pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's is around 1715. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones) show strong peaks around 1700 cm^-1, so maybe A has an ester or a ketone. The shift to 1715 for E could be a different carbonyl, maybe a ketone since esters are around 1740 or so. Wait, but the problem says E is formed after elimination of an inert gas. Let me think.

Looking at the options, all of them except option B are cyclohexanone or cyclopentanone derivatives. Wait, no, option B is a cyclopentanone, A is cyclohexanone, C is cycloheptanone, D is cyclobutanone.

So, I think the initial steps probably involve a carbonyl group. Let's go step by step.

First reaction: A + HCN â†’ B.

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an ester, HCN might not react. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a ketone, and HCN adds to form a cyanohydrin (a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached). Or maybe A is an aldehyde, but let's see.

Then, compound B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd. So that's a catalyst for hydrogenation, which usually reduces triple bonds or double bonds. If B has a nitrile group (from HCN addition), then hydrogenation might reduce the nitrile to an amine, but wait, under H2 and Pd, nitriles typically reduce to amines. But wait, I'm not sure about the conditions. Alternatively, if B has a double bond, like a substituted cyclopropane, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the first reaction is A with HCN. Another possibility is that A is a ketone, and HCN adds to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. So A has a ketone group (so the IR in hint b shows a peak around 1750, which is higher than a typical ketone. Wait,
