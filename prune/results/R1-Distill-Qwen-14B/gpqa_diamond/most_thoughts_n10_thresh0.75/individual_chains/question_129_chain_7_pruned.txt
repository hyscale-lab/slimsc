Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are several steps, and each gives a new compound. I'll need to work backwards or forwards through each reaction to figure out the structures.

Let me break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Also, there are two hints provided:

Hint a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So, compound A is probably a ketone because that's what the Wittig reagent reacts with.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= group, right? Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=, which is the same as a propenyl group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, but attached as a substituent. So, the structure is a cyclopentane with two methyl groups on adjacent carbons and a substituted double bond.

Wait, the product after Wittig is an alkene. So, the starting compound A (the ketone) must have a carbonyl group that's adjacent to where the double bond forms. Let's think. When a Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with a ketone, it forms an alkene where the carbonyl was. So, the carbonyl is at a certain position, and the addition of the ylide's R groups happens there.

In the product, the substituents are 1,2-dimethyl and the propan-2-ylidene at position 4. Wait, maybe the cyclopentane ring is such that the ylide adds to a carbonyl, creating a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Let me try to draw this out mentally. Suppose compound A is cyclopentanone with substituents. Wait, cyclopentanone is a five-membered ring with a ketone. If the Wittig reagent adds a group to the carbonyl, replacing the O with a double bond to the R group.

Wait, the product after the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituted double bond.

Wait, perhaps compound A is something like 4-methylcyclopentanone. Because when the Wittig reaction occurs, the carbonyl (C=O) at position 1 would react, forming a double bond. Wait, but if the product has the substituent at position 4, maybe the ketone was at position 3 or 4?

Alternatively, maybe compound A is 2-methylcyclopentanone. Let me think: If the Wittig reagent adds across the carbonyl, forming an alkene, the structure would have a new double bond adjacent to where the carbonyl was.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the product is a cyclopentane with a double bond between C3 and C4, and substituents on C1 and C2. That would make sense. So, the original compound A would have been a ketone in that position
