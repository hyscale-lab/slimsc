Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about an electron's state and some probabilities and an average value. Hmm. Let's read it again.

Alright, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. I think those are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis, right?

Wait, the first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, I guess, since it's acting on a two-level system (up and down). So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Wait, because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices go from 1 to 2, right? So A_12 and A_21 are non-zero, others zero. So it's an off-diagonal matrix. 

Wait, what's the operator with this form? Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so perhaps this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X. Because the Pauli matrices are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), each multiplied by ħ/2 gives the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z.

Wait, but wait, the operator here is A with elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j. So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, ħ/2
Row 2: ħ/2, 0

Which is exactly ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. So this operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of S_x.

So to find the probabilities, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of σ_x (or the eigenstates of A), and then the square of the coefficients would give the probabilities.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of σ_z. So perhaps I should first represent the state in the σ_x eigenbasis, or perhaps find the eigenstates of A and then compute the inner products.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the operator's eigenstates and then find the projections of |alpha> onto them.

Wait, let me think about the operator A. Since A = (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 multiplied by 1, because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of A are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which I think can be written as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (
