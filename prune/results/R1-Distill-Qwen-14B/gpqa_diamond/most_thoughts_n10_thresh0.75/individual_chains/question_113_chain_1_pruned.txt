Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to analyze each of these to figure out which formula fits best.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR often indicate O-H stretching. So this might suggest the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the problem also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some double bond nearby or possibly an ester or something else. Hmm, so maybe the compound has two different carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group.

Wait, but 1700 and 1650—what else could they be? Another possibility is that one is a carbonyl (like a ketone at 1700) and the other is an aromatic ring with conjugation, but 1650 is a bit lower than typical for aromatic C=C (which is usually around 1600). Or maybe it's an amide? No, because the options don't have nitrogen. So, perhaps one is a carbonyl and another is an adjacent group. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. That could explain the lower wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond. That could be part of an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring, but since it's specifically vinyl hydrogens, I'm thinking it's an alkene, not aromatic.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry part: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think, what gives m/z 45? Well, one possibility is that the fragment is an ethyl group with some oxygen. Alternatively, it could be a CH2CH2O group or something like that. Wait, wait. Another thought: 45 could be the fragment of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since CH3 is 15, and O is 16; 15*2 +16=46. Oh wait, no, 45. Hmm. Maybe it's a different group. Another possibility is that 45 is the mass of a CH2CH2O fragment, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass of a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group breaking
