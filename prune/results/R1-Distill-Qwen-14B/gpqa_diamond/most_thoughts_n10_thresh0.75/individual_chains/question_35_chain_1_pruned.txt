Okay, I need to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's start by understanding the question. So, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator. 

Wait, the setup is given. The operator Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should write out the matrix form of Ay.

Let me calculate Ay. Since c is h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So,

S matrix:
Row 1: 0   -i
Row 2: i    0

So, Ay would be:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

Simplify that:

Ay = [ [0, -i h/(4π) ], [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

Hmm. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating each part. The (1,1) and (2,2) terms are -a each, so their product is a squared.

The off-diagonal terms: (-i)(i) = (since i * i is -1, and here it's -i * i = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So, the product of the off-diagonal terms is (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²).

Wait, let's compute the determinant:

det = (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So, det = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So,

det = a² - [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Set determinant to zero: a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²)

Take square roots: a = ± h/(4 π) 

Wait, so eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So, the eigenvalues are real numbers, actually. Because the determinant calculation led to real eigenvalues.

Wait a second, but looking at the options, options A and B mention imaginary parts. Hmm. Because the matrix Ay is anti-hermitian? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the structure of S. The S matrix is:

0   -i
i    0

Which is similar to the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Because the Pauli Y matrix is:

0   -i
i    0

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, S is σy. So, S = σy.

The operator Ay is c * σy, c = h/(4π). So, σy is a Hermitian matrix? Wait, no, σy is Hermitian because σy† = σy. Because the matrix σy is equal to its conjugate transpose.

Wait, but let me check. The conjugate transpose of σy is:

Row 1: 0   i
Row 2: -i  0

Which is not the same
