Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium, the speed is v_medium = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed observed?

Wait, right, the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is going through the glass which itself is moving. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame.

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically; you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n. Let me think: in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. Because the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, no. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass is moving. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So how do these combine?

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the first frame and u' is in the second. But wait, wait: the direction is important. The glass is moving towards the observer, so from the lab's perspective, the glass's velocity is v. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at (c/n) in the same direction. So when we switch frames, we add velocities relativistically.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction as the glass is moving in the lab. So the lab sees the glass moving at v towards the observer. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v (say, in the positive x-direction). The light in the glass is moving at speed u = c/n in the same direction. So from the lab's point of view, the light's speed is not just u + v, that's the classical approach. But relativity says that it's not that simple.

Wait, but wait another thing: the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. Oh, wait, but that's when light is in a vacuum. Because in a medium, it's slower, so the speed isn't c. Hmm, that's where I get confused because in a medium, the speed depends on the medium. But from the lab frame, when the medium is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change?

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So it's not the same as the speed of the light in vacuum. Because the light is inside the glass, which is moving. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light is not necessarily c/n, but adjusted based on the motion of the medium.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Lorentz transformation for velocities. Let me denote the rest frame of the glass as S', and the lab frame as S. In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity in S (which is v).

Wait, no. The glass's velocity in the lab is v. So the S' frame (glass's frame) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S frame). In S', the light speed is u' = c/n. So to find u, the speed in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no. Because in the S' frame (glass frame), the light is moving at u' = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in S. So the lab (S) would see the light's speed as u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). But wait, since u' is in the same direction as v, so they add. But u' is c/n, and c is 1.

So substituting u' = (1)/n. So u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) ].

But wait, the options don't have denominators with 1 + (v/(n c²)), but since c=1, it's 1 + v/(n).

So let's compute that. Numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: [n + v ] /n. Wait, because 1 = n/n, so 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n.

So putting it together, u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ].

The n denominators cancel out, so u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1+nv)/(n + v), and option C is (1 - nv)/(n - v), but I don't think it's that. So according to this, the correct answer would be A.

But wait, I might be getting the direction wrong. Let me double-check. If the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, then in the lab frame, the light is coming towards us, same as the glass's movement. So the velocity addition formula should correctly give the speed of light as (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

Wait, but let me make sure of the signs. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then when the glass is moving towards the observer (and the light is moving towards the observer as well), so both u' and v are in the same direction, so they add in the numerator.

So the calculation I did before would give (1 + n v)/(n + v). So that would be option A.

But wait, wait a second: I recall that in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any frame. But this is in a medium, so in this case, the light is in a moving medium, so its speed relative to the lab would be different.

Hmm, but according to the calculation, it's (1+nv)/(n + v). Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer (v positive in that direction), then the speed of light in the lab should be higher than c/n. Because the medium is moving towards you, so the light might appear to move faster? Or perhaps not, because the medium's motion affects the light's speed.

Wait, but let's think about the case when v is zero. Then the speed would be (1)/(n), which is correct, because the light in the glass is c/n, which with c=1 is 1/n.

If the glass is moving with v positive in the same direction as the light, then the denominator is (n + v), numerator 1 + n v. So for small v, the speed would be approximately (1 +n v )/(n) = (1/n) + v, which makes sense classically: the light's speed in the medium is c/n, and the medium is moving towards you, so the observed speed would be c/n + v. But wait, in reality, according to relativity, you can't just add like that. But for small v, the approximation would hold.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula, when v is small, the denominator is approximately 1, so u ≈ u' + v. So in the case of u' = 1/n, u ≈ (1/n) + v. Which makes sense for small v.

So the formula I derived earlier seems to fit that.

Looking at the options, only option A matches that.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach it might be to consider the frame moving with the glass. In that frame, the light has speed c/n. But when you transform back to the lab frame, where the glass is moving at v, then the light's speed is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v/c² ).

So substituting u' = c/n =1/n, and c=1, so u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

So that's the conclusion. The speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is (1 + n v)/(n + v), so the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option B (\( 1 \)) does not account for the refractive index or the motion of the glass.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n - v} \)) has incorrect signs and would apply if the glass were moving in the opposite direction.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) also has incorrect signs and does not match the derived formula.

Thus, the correct speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
