Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 to 10^-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get that right. The natural line width or resonance width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So solving for τ, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, the decay length would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So decay length L = v * τ. Since the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, I probably need to calculate its velocity.

But wait, first I need to find the velocity. The particle's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can compute the relativistic gamma factor γ, which is E / (m c²), since E = γ m c². I think in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but when converting to meters and seconds, I'll need to include them.

Wait, let me think about the units carefully. E is given in GeV, mass in GeV/c², but in natural units, energy in eV, mass in eV/c², but when using SI units, I need to convert everything properly.

First, let's compute gamma (γ) as E_X divided by m_X. So E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approx 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, solving for v. Let me rearrange this:

γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)
=> 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ²
=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ²
=> v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²)

So plugging in γ = 6.6667, let's compute 1/γ² = 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking sqrt gives sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. So about 0.9887c.

Wait, but that's in natural units. So when calculating v in m/s, I need to multiply by c. But perhaps I can proceed symbolically first.

So the decay length L is v * τ. And τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to be careful with units. Everything needs to be in SI units for the final answer.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Calculate v ≈ c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).
3. L = v * τ.

But wait, let me double-check the formula for decay length. The mean decay length is c * τ * β γ, where β is v/c. Or wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is the proper time. So the lab frame lifetime is γ τ. So then the decay length L would be v * (γ τ). Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Because the lifetime τ is the proper time (the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle). So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: τ_lab = γ τ. So the decay length is v * τ_lab = v * γ τ.

So the formula is L = v * γ τ.

Wait, let me confirm. The lifetime in the rest frame is τ. The lab frame sees the particle moving, so the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the moving particle's lifetime is γ τ. So the distance it travels before decaying is v multiplied by this dilated lifetime.

So yes, L = v * γ * τ.

But I need to compute everything correctly.

Alternatively, some textbooks give the mean decay length as L = cτ * (p)/(m c), since p = gamma m v, so p/(m c) is gamma v. Hmm, but perhaps that's another way to compute beta gamma.

Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime is tau, and the speed is v. Then the decay length is v * gamma tau. Because the lifetime observed is gamma tau.

Yes, that makes sense.

So putting it all together:

L = v * gamma * tau.

But tau is ħ / Gamma. So first, compute tau = ħ / Gamma.

Then, compute gamma as E / (m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.66666....

So gamma is 6.66666....

Wait, but wait. E is the total energy. E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is E/(m c²). Since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c² respectively, in natural units, c is 1, but when converting to SI units, I need to handle the units properly.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute everything using natural units and then convert.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity as beta c, where beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). 

So let's compute beta:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

gamma squared is (6.6666667)^2 = approx 44.444444.

So 1/gamma² = 0.0225, as before.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1 - 1/(6.6666667)^2:

6.6666667 squared is 44.4444444444.

1 / 44.444444 is approximately 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So yes, beta is about 0.9887.

Now, compute tau. Tau is ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV. But I need to convert this into energy units compatible with ħ.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV.

Let me convert Gamma from MeV to GeV for consistency with E and m. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

Wait, but when calculating ħ / Gamma, units are in GeV^-1. So I need to convert Gamma into J·s^-1.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate everything in terms of eV. Let me think.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Wait, let me get precise values.

Wait, more precisely, ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, and ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (but I'm getting a bit confused). Alternatively, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm. Oh wait, perhaps it's better to convert all quantities into eV and meters.

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should proceed step by step.

Here's the plan:

1. Compute τ in seconds: τ = ħ / Γ.

   ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

   Γ is 0.32 GeV (because 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV).

   So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

2. Compute gamma: gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

3. Compute beta: sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.4444)) ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

4. Compute v: beta * c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

5. Compute the lab frame lifetime: gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.373e-23 s.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, tau is the proper time, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

Then, decay length L = v * (gamma tau).

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (1.373e-23 s) ≈ 4.065e-15 meters.

Wait, let me calculate that precisely.

Compute tau:

tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Gamma is 6.6666667, so gamma tau is 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.373e-23 seconds.

v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply v by gamma tau: 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = ?

Let me compute 2.9661e8 * 1.373e-23 = (2.9661 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

2.9661 * 1.373 ≈ 4.065.

So 4.065e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So the correct answer seems to be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, perhaps when computing v, I should use the exact calculation. Let me re-calculate beta more accurately.

Let me compute 1/gamma squared: 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = 1/( (6.6666667)^2 ) ≈ 1/44.4444444 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let's compute it more accurately.

What's 0.9775^0.5?

Well, 0.988^2 = (0.98)^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.008 + (0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 = 0.976144. That's lower than 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.008 * 0.98 * 2 = 0.01568.

0.0007 * 0.98 * 2 = 0.001372.

0.0007^2 = 0.00000049.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 0.9887 squared step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach.

Well, 0.9887 * 0.9887 = let's compute:

9887 * 9887. Let me compute 9887^2.

But perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that beta is approximately 0.9887, which gives us v as 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, let's compute the exact numbers again.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

v = 0.9887 * 3e8 = let's compute 0.9887 * 3 = 2.9661, so 2.9661e8 m/s.

Now, gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.373e-23 s.

Multiply by v:

2.9661e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = (2.9661 * 1.373) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 2.9661 * 1.373.

Let me compute 3 * 1.373 = 4.119. But 2.9661 is 3 - 0.0339.

So 2.9661 * 1.373 = 3 * 1.373 - 0.0339 * 1.373.

3 * 1.373 = 4.119.

0.0339 * 1.373 ≈ 0.0465.

So 4.119 - 0.0465 ≈ 4.0725.

Hmm, wait, that's not matching earlier calculation. Earlier I thought it was about 4.065. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

2.9661 * 1.373:

Let me multiply 2.9661 by 1.373.

Breaking it down:

2.9661 * 1 = 2.9661

2.9661 * 0.3 = 0.88983

2.9661 * 0.07 = 0.207627

2.9661 * 0.003 = 0.0088983

Adding them up:

2.9661 + 0.88983 = 3.85593

3.85593 + 0.207627 = 4.063557

4.063557 + 0.0088983 ≈ 4.072455.

Hmm, so it's approximately 4.0725e-15 m. But looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15, and option C is about 5e-15.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me re-calculate beta more precisely.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

But in natural units, E = gamma m c^2, so (E/(gamma m c²))^2 = 1. So beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So (m c²) is 1.2 GeV.

So (m c^2)^2 is (1.2)^2 GeV² = 1.44 GeV².

E² = (8)^2 GeV² = 64 GeV².

So (m c^2)^2 / E² = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Hmm, perhaps I need a more precise calculation of the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

I know that sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.9899494936611665.

Wait, but 0.9775 is less than 0.98.

Wait, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion around 0.98.

Alternatively, perhaps use linear approximation.

Let me think: Let x=0.9775.

We can use the approximation that sqrt(x) ≈ sqrt(0.98) + (x - 0.98)/(2 sqrt(0.98)).

So sqrt(0.98) is approximately 0.9899494937.

x = 0.9775, which is 0.98 - 0.0025.

So delta x = -0.0025.

So sqrt(x) ≈ sqrt(0.98) + (delta x) / (2 * sqrt(0.98)).

Which is 0.9899494937 + (-0.0025)/(2 * 0.9899494937).

Compute denominator 2 * 0.9899494937 ≈ 1.979898987.

So (delta x)/denominator ≈ (-0.0025) / 1.979898987 ≈ -0.001262.

So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9899494937 - 0.001262 ≈ 0.988687.

So beta is approximately 0.988687.

So v = 0.988687 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96606e8 m/s.

Now, let me re-calculate L.

L = v * gamma * tau.

Compute each part:

tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.66666667.

v = 0.988687 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96606e8 m/s.

So gamma * tau = 6.66666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.373e-23 s.

Now, multiply by v:

2.96606e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = (2.96606 * 1.373) * 1e-15 m.

Compute 2.96606 * 1.373.

Let me do it step by step:

2.96606 * 1 = 2.96606

2.96606 * 0.3 = 0.889818

2.96606 * 0.07 = 0.2076242

2.96606 * 0.003 = 0.00889818

Adding all together:

2.96606
+ 0.889818 = 3.855878

+ 0.2076242 = 4.0635022

+ 0.00889818 = 4.07240038.

So approximately 4.0724e-15 m.

Wait, but the options don't have this value. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16

B) 4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16

Hmm, my calculation gives about 4.07e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15. Close enough, considering possible approximations.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v * gamma tau.

Wait, let me recompute 2.96606e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s.

Multiply 2.96606e8 by 1.373e-23:

= (2.96606 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

As before, 2.96606 * 1.373 ≈ 4.0724.

So 4.0724e-15 m. But the options don't have this; the closest is option B: 4.0655e-15.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) accurately.

I can use a more precise method. Let me compute 0.9775^0.5.

Let me look for a number x where x^2 = 0.9775.

We know that 0.988^2 = 0.976144.

0.9887^2 = (0.988 + 0.0007)^2 = 0.988^2 + 2 * 0.988 * 0.0007 + (0.0007)^2.

= 0.976144 + 0.0013832 + 0.00000049 = 0.97752769.

Ah, that's very close to 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2 = approximately 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So earlier calculation of beta as 0.9887 is correct.

So why is my calculation giving 4.07e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15?

Ah, perhaps the exact calculation of 2.96606e8 *1.373e-23 is a bit different.

Wait, let me recompute 2.96606e8 * 1.373e-23.

2.96606e8 is 296,606,000.

1.373e-23 is 0.0000000000000000000001373.

Multiplying them: 296,606,000 * 0.0000000000000000000001373.

Wait, 296,606,000 = 2.96606e8.

So 2.96606e8 * 1.373e-23 = 2.96606 * 1.373 * 1e-15.

Compute 2.96606 * 1.373.

Let me do this more precisely.

Let me compute 2.96606 * 1.373.

Break it down:

1.373 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.003.

So,

2.96606 * 1 = 2.96606

2.96606 * 0.3 = 0.889818

2.96606 * 0.07 = 0.2076242

2.96606 * 0.003 = 0.00889818

Adding all together:

2.96606 + 0.889818 = 3.855878

+ 0.2076242 = 4.0635022

+ 0.00889818 = 4.0723999.

Wait, that's 4.0723999e-15 m.

But none of the options match this, except perhaps option B is 4.0655e-15 which is close but not the same. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing tau. Let me recheck.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Gamma is 6.6666667.

v is 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So v * gamma tau = 2.9661e8 * 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this as:

L = v * gamma * tau.

So first compute gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.373e-23 s.

Then, v * (gamma tau) = 2.9661e8 m/s * 1.373e-23 s = (2.9661 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

As before, 2.9661 * 1.373 is about 4.0724, leading to 4.0724e-15 m.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta. Let me compute beta using more precise methods.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Using a calculator-like approach:

We know that 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769, which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So 0.9887^2 = 0.97752769.

We need x^2 = 0.9775.

So x is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ ?

Let me use linear approximation around x=0.9887.

x=0.9887, f(x)=x²=0.97752769.

We need f(x) =0.9775, which is 0.97752769 - 0.9775 = 0.00002769 less.

So, delta f = -0.00002769.

df = 2x dx = delta f.

So, dx ≈ delta f / (2x) = -0.00002769 / (2 *0.9887) ) ≈ -0.00002769 / 1.9774 ≈ -0.000014.

So x ≈ 0.9887 - 0.000014 = 0.988686.

So beta ≈ 0.988686.

So v = beta c = 0.988686 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966058e8 m/s.

Now, let's recompute L.

L = v * gamma * tau.

v = 2.966058e8 m/s.

gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 1.373e-23 s.

So L = 2.966058e8 * 1.373e-23 = (2.966058 * 1.373) * 1e-15.

2.966058 * 1.373.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 2.966058 * 1 = 2.966058.

2.966058 * 0.3 = 0.8898174.

2.966058 * 0.07 = 0.20762406.

2.966058 * 0.003 = 0.008898174.

Adding all together:

2.966058 + 0.8898174 = 3.8558754.

Plus 0.20762406 → 4.0635 (3.8558754 + 0.20762406 = 4.06349946).

Plus 0.008898174 → 4.07239763.

So 4.0724e-15 m.

Hmm, this is 4.0724e-15 m. But the option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a bit lower. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of tau.

Wait, tau = hbar / Gamma.

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute 6.582 / 0.32.

6.582 ÷ 0.32.

Well, 0.32 * 20 = 6.4. 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182.

So 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) → 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the decay length formula is different.

Wait, another formula I've heard of is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma.

So L = c * tau * (beta gamma) → but beta gamma is (gamma v/c).

Wait, but beta is v/c, so beta gamma = gamma (v/c).

So c * tau * beta gamma = c tau gamma (v/c) ) = tau gamma v.

Which is the same as v gamma tau.

So same result.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the mean lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau, then L = v * gamma tau.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the decay length formula as L = c tau * (p c^2)/(E).

Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c^2.

Wait, let's see.

p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c).

So p c = gamma m beta c^2.

Then, (p c^2)/(E) = (gamma m beta c^2) * c^2 / (gamma m c^2) ) = beta c^2.

Wait, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (p c^2)/E.

E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m beta c.

So (p c^2)/E = (gamma m beta c * c^2 ) / (gamma m c^2) ) = (gamma m beta c^3) / (gamma m c^2) ) = beta c.

So L = c tau * (p c^2)/(E) → but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps L = c tau * (p c^2) / (E) → but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the decay length is given by L = c * tau_{lab} * beta, where tau_lab is the lifetime in the lab frame. Tau_lab = gamma tau.

So L = c * gamma tau * beta.

Which is the same as c * gamma tau beta.

But since beta = v/c, this is the same as v tau gamma.

Yes, same as before.

So the calculation should be correct.

Hmm, perhaps the given options are based on an approximate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, let me compute beta using more precise methods.

We have E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c².

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2)^2 / E^2).

Wait, (m c^2)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2.

E^2 = (8 GeV)^2.

So (m c^2)^2 / E^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98868.

So, using beta = 0.98868.

v = 0.98868 * 3e8 m/s → 2.96604e8 m/s.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

tau = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma * tau = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.373e-23 s.

v * gamma tau = 2.96604e8 * 1.373e-23 = ?

Let me compute 2.96604e8 * 1.373e-23:

Multiply 2.96604 by 1.373.

2.96604 * 1 = 2.96604.

2.96604 * 0.3 = 0.889812.

2.96604 * 0.07 = 0.2076228.

2.96604 * 0.003 = 0.00889812.

Adding them up:

2.96604 + 0.889812 = 3.855852.

+ 0.2076228 = 4.0634748.

+ 0.00889812 = 4.07237292.

So 4.07237e-15 m.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * tau * beta gamma, which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps the production energy is not the same as the rest mass energy. Wait, the production energy is E_X=8 GeV. So the particle is moving with energy 8 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, which is the total energy. So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8/(1.2) = 6.6666667. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me check the value of ħ. The exact value is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 s.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach: using the relation between width and lifetime.

Gamma = ħ / tau → tau = ħ / Gamma.

So tau is 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, beta gamma is approximately 6.6666667 * 0.98868 ≈ 6.6 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.5245.

Wait, 6.6666667 * 0.98868 = ?

Compute 6 * 0.98868 = 5.93208.

0.6666667 * 0.98868 ≈ 0.65912.

Total ≈ 5.93208 + 0.65912 = 6.5912.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.5912.

Then, L = c * tau * beta gamma.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 6.5912.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5912: 6.170625e-16 * 6.5912 ≈ 4.072e-15 m.

Same result.

But the options don't have 4.072e-15.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a mistake, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should take into account that the decay width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Yes, that was correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given as a total width, but in the formula, it's the natural linewidth which is Gamma = ħ / tau. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the relation between the decay width and the mean lifetime correctly.

Wait, I think the approach is correct, but the calculated value doesn't match any of the options except option B is 4.0655e-15, which is close but not matching exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately the product of 2.966058e8 * 1.373e-23.

But let me think: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another approach: using the relativistic formula for velocity.

E = gamma m c^2.

p = gamma m v.

But perhaps I can compute v as (pc²)/E.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because p = gamma m v → v = (p c^2)/(gamma m c^2) ) → which is (p c^2)/(E).

Wait, but E = gamma m c².

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between velocity and gamma.

We can write v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Which is the same as before.

So v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Which gives v = c * sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) ) → sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64) )= sqrt(1-0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = 0.9887 c.

So same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of 2.966058e8 * 1.373e-23.

Wait, 2.966058e8 is 296,605,800.

1.373e-23 is 0.0000000000000000000001373.

Multiplying these:

296,605,800 * 0.0000000000000000000001373.

Let me compute 296,605,800 * 1.373e-23.

But this is the same as 2.966058e8 * 1.373e-23 = 4.07237e-15 m.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the correct calculation leads to approximately 4.07e-15 meters.

But looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, possibly due to more precise constants or calculations.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay length \( L \), the velocity \( v \), and the lifetime \( \tau \) in the rest frame of the particle. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( v \) is the velocity of the particle, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

where \( E \) is the total energy of the particle (\( 8 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( m \) is the rest mass (\( 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)). Substituting these values:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = 0.9775
\]

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887 \cdot c \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The lab-frame lifetime is \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

The decay length is then:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.373 \times 10^{-23})
\]

\[
L \approx (2.9661 \cdot 1.373) \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.072 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.072 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option \( B \), \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

**Answer: B**
