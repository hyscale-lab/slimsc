Okay, so I have this question about immunology, specifically about rotavirus and the immune response. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm. So, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses are initiated, especially for pathogens that enter through the gut. Rotavirus is a gut pathogen, so that makes sense.

The GFP-tagged proteins were given via oral gavage, which means they're entering the digestive system. Stomach acid can break down proteins, which explains why some fluorescence was destroyed. The ones that made it through the stomach probably moved into the small intestine, where the mucus is. Intestinal mucus can trap things, so some proteins got stuck there. But eventually, some reach the secondary lymphoid organs, like the Peyer's patches.

Once in the Peyer's patches, these proteins would likely be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, such as M cells or dendritic cells. These cells present the antigen to B cells, which then become activated. Activated B cells start proliferating and differentiating. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that some process is causing the diversity among these B cells.

Now, thinking about the processes. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination occurs during the generation of the B cell receptor (BCR) in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region. But this happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, so if the B cells are already in the Peyer's patches, which is a secondary lymphoid organ, VDJ wouldn't be happening here. So D is probably not the answer.

Class switching recombination (CSR) is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG). This happens after the initial immune response, typically in response to a secondary antigen exposure. But this question is about the initial response, and the cells are proliferating, so maybe it's not CSR either. Though, I'm not too sure. Wait, class switching is part of the immune response when the B cell starts producing different types of antibodies, but this process doesn't directly cause variability in the variable region.

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process that occurs in activated B cells, particularly in the germinal centers. During SHM, the variable regions of the BCR are mutated, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This process happens after the B cell is activated and has started to proliferate. So if the variable heavy chain gene shows high variability, this must be due to SHM. That seems to fit because each B cell would have slightly different mutations, leading to a diverse population.

Complement activation is more about the destruction of pathogens. It's part of the innate immune response and doesn't directly cause variability in the B cell receptors. So B is probably not the answer.

So putting it all together: The GFP-tagged proteins are antigens that activate B cells in the Peyer's patches. These activated B cells undergo proliferation and during this process, somatic hypermutation introduces variability in their variable heavy chain genes. Therefore, the process is somatic hypermutation.


The question involves an immunological response to GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins delivered to mice via oral gavage. The proteins encounter gastric acidity and intestinal mucus, with some reaching the Peyer's patches, where fluorescently labeled proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, prompting the identification of the process responsible.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are key sites for initiating immune responses to gut pathogens like rotavirus. The observed fluorescence destruction by stomach acid and entanglement in mucus are consistent with the challenges antigens face in the digestive system. Once these proteins reach the Peyer's patches, they are likely taken up by antigen-presenting cells, activating B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases diversity among the B cell receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D)** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, so it is not applicable here.
- **Class switching recombination (C)** involves altering the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not directly explain the variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **Complement activation (B)** is part of the innate immune response and does not account for the observed variability in the B cell receptors.
- **Somatic hypermutation (A)** is a process that introduces mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors during activation and proliferation in germinal centers. This process directly explains the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene, making it the correct answer.

Thus, the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is due to somatic hypermutation, a process that diversifies B cell receptors during the immune response.

Answer: A
