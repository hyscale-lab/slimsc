Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. There are six substances, numbered 1 to 6, each undergoing this reaction in excess. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall what electrophilic substitution reactions involve. These reactions typically add a substituent to a benzene ring. The substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para relative to itself. This directing depends on whether the substituent is activating (electron donating) or deactivating (electron withdrawing).

But wait, the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So I'm thinking, for each structure, which positions the substituent directs the incoming Br+ to, and how much of the product will be the para isomer.

Let me list the structures again:

1) C6H5-CH3 → This is toluene, methylbenzene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine reacts with toluene, the Br will add mainly to the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 → This is ethyl benzoate. The substituent here is a carbonyl group (COOEt). The carbonyl is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group, so it's meta-directing. So when bromine reacts, the Br will add mostly to the meta position relative to the COOEt group.

3) C6H5-Cl → This is chlorobenzene. The Cl is a substituent that's deactivating (because of its electronegativity), but it's ortho/para-directing. So when brominated, it will add Br mainly to the ortho and para positions relative to Cl.

Wait, wait. Chlorine is a substituent that's a bit tricky. It's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the electronegativity) but it's also ortho/para-directing because of its lone pairs. So yes, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para, but because it's deactivating, the reaction is slower compared to activating groups.

4) C6H5-NO2 → Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when brominated, the Br will add mainly to the meta position relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5 → This is ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So bromination will lead to Br mostly at ortho and para positions relative to the ethyl group.

6) C6H5-COOH → Benzoic acid. The substituent here is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a strong deactivating group (due to electron-withdrawing effects), and it's meta-directing. So when brominated, the Br will add mostly to the meta position.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, I need to determine how much of the product will be the para-brominated derivative.

Wait, but in some cases, the substituent might not allow for para substitution. For example, in nitrobenzene (4), the substituent is meta-directing, so the main product is the meta isomer, with very little para. Similarly, ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6) are meta-directing, so their main products are meta, meaning that the para isomer would be less in those cases.

But wait, for some substituents, like the methyl group in toluene (1) and ethyl group in ethylbenzene (5), the substituent directs to ortho and para. So for these, the para product is a major product, but the ortho is also a major.

But in bromine substitution, sometimes steric effects can play a role. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is small, so ortho and para are both accessible. Similarly, in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is a bit bulkier, but bromination occurs at the ring, so maybe para is still a major site.

Wait, but wait. For toluene (1), the methyl is activating, so the reaction is faster. When bromine is in excess, but the reaction is a substitution. So for each substituent, the para product is a significant fraction.

Wait, but for each substance, how much of the product is para?

Let me go through each one:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): the methyl group is activating and ortho/para-directing. So the major products are ortho and para. But because the para position is less hindered than ortho (sterically), perhaps para is the major product. However, the question is about the weight of para. So if the ortho and para are possible, their percentages depend on the substituent's directing effect.

Wait, but in the case of toluene, the ortho is possible but may have some steric hindrance due to the methyl group being close. So maybe the para isomer is more favored. So for toluene, the para isomer may have a higher weight fraction compared to other substituents that don't direct to para.

2) C6H5-CO-OEt (ethyl benzoate): substituent is COOEt, which is meta-directing. So the main product is the meta isomer, and the para is a minor product. Hence, the weight fraction of para is low.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Cl is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So the major products are ortho and para. But since Cl is a deactivating group, the ring is less reactive. But in terms of direction, para is a major site. So the weight fraction of para would be higher than meta-directing substituents, but lower than activating groups.

Wait, but for chlorobenzene, the substituent is -Cl, which is an electron-withdrawing (deactivating) but ortho/para-directing. So when bromine reacts, Br is added to ortho and para. So in bromination, the major products are ortho and para. But which is more? I'm not entirely sure, but I think in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is often the major, especially under certain conditions. But wait, sometimes, steric factors may play a role. The ortho position has the Cl and the incoming Br in close proximity. So maybe para is more favored, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the nitration of chlorobenzene tends to give more para product than ortho, but I'm not entirely sure about bromination.

Wait, but for this problem, perhaps the main point is to compare the para fractions across all substituents.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): substituent is nitro, which is meta-directing. So the main product is meta. So the para isomer would be a minor fraction. Therefore, the para's weight fraction would be low.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): substituent is ethyl, which is activating, ortho/para-directing. So major products are ortho and para. Again, the para isomer's weight fraction would be high, similar to toluene.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): substituent is COOH, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So the main product is meta, so the para fraction is low.

Now, the question is to arrange them in order of INCREASING weight fraction of para-isomer. So from lowest to highest.

Looking at each substituent:

- Substances 2 and 4 and 6 are meta-directing, so their para fractions are low. Substances 1 and 3 and 5 are ortho/para-directing, so their para fractions are higher.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: para fraction is the amount of para product relative to all possible products. So for substituents that are meta-directing, the para product is a minor (so low weight fraction). For ortho/para-directing, para is a major product but perhaps not the highest.

Wait, but in the cases where the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the products are ortho and para. So the weight fraction of para would be about 50% (if both are equally likely), but in reality, steric factors or other effects may make para more or less.

Wait, perhaps for toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), the para isomers are more significant than for chlorobenzene (3), or vice versa.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The para fraction will be highest for substituents that are ortho/para-directing and activating, because Br adds predominantly in the para position. For example, toluene: methyl is activating, so the reaction is more favorable, and the para product is significant. Similarly, ethyl group in ethylbenzene is activating, so para is a major product.

On the other hand, chlorobenzene (3) has Cl, which is deactivating but ortho/para-directing. So the para product is major, but perhaps less than in toluene and ethylbenzene, because the ring is less activated.

Wait, but the activating groups (like methyl, ethyl) make the ring more reactive. So when the substituent is activating, the para product would be major compared to deactivating substituents.

Wait, but in the case of chlorobenzene, which is deactivating, the para product fraction is lower than for activating substituents. So perhaps the order from lowest to highest para fraction is as follows:

The meta-directing substituents (2,4,6) will have low para fractions. Among these, benzoic acid (6) is a stronger deactivating group than ethyl benzoate (2), which is more deactivating than nitro (4)? Wait, no, the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than COOEt.

Wait, substituent strength (deactivating): nitro > carbonyl > carboxylic acid? Wait, nitro is a strong deactivator, COOEt is also deactivating, and COOH is strongly deactivating.

Wait, but in terms of directing, all these are meta directors. So for the meta directors, the para fraction is low, but which is the lowest?

So among 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), and 6 (COOH), which has the lowest para fraction?

Wait, perhaps the stronger the deactivating effect, the less reactive the ring, but for para substitution, maybe the substituent's directing effect is more important. Since all are meta directors, the para product is minor, but I'm not sure about the exact order.

Alternatively, perhaps the deactivating substituents lead to lower para fractions because the ring is less reactive, but the directing effect determines where the substitution occurs.

Wait, but in any case, for the meta directors, the para fraction is low, but how low? Let's say that the para fraction for substance 2 is x, substance 4 is y, and 6 is z. Then, perhaps the order is 6 < 4 < 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The substituent's effect on directing is independent of its effect on ring reactivity. But if the substituent is a stronger deactivator, the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But that affects the overall rate, not the ratio of product isomers.

Wait, right. The ratio is determined by the directing effect, not the rate. So for all meta directors, the para fraction would be lower than for ortho/para directors.

But specifically, among the meta directors, which would have higher or lower para fractions? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is zero for meta directors, but that's not correct. Because meta directors lead to meta substitution, but para is a minor product. Wait, no. Electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring with a meta-directing group would lead to substitution primarily at the meta positions, but small amounts can occur at ortho and para due to possible resonance or other effects, but it's minimal.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. If a substituent is meta-directing, most substitution occurs at meta. So the para would have a small fraction. So for substituents 2,4,6, the para fractions would be the smallest.

Now, among these, which is the smallest? Because all are meta directors, but perhaps the position of the substituent affects the para product. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's electron-withdrawing effect affects the possibility of substitution in other positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate certain positions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the main point is that among the meta directors, each will have a small para fraction. And the order of their para fractions may depend on the substituent's nature.

But perhaps the para fraction is highest in the ortho/para directors and lowest in the meta directors.

So among the substances, the para fractions from low to high would be:

Lowest: meta directors (2,4,6), then maybe ortho/para directors (1,3,5). But wait, chlorobenzene (3) is a deactivating, ortho/para director, so the para product may not be as high as for activating substituents.

Wait, in the case of activating substituents (like methyl, ethyl), the para product is major, while for deactivating substituents (like Cl, NO2), the para product is less, but still present.

So, perhaps the order of para fractions is:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions.

Then, substances with ortho/para directors but deactivating (3) have higher.

Then, substances with activating ortho/para directors (1,5) have the highest.

Wait, but that's not exactly right. Let me think.

Wait, the para fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect. For example, if a substituent is ortho/para-directing, the para is a major product. If it's meta-directing, para is a minor product.

So the para fractions would be highest for ortho/para directors, and lowest for meta directors.

So, among the substances:

Substances 1 (toluene, ortho/para, activating): high para fraction.

Substance 3 (Cl, ortho/para, deactivating): para fraction may be lower than 1 but higher than meta directors.

Substance 5 (ethyl, ortho/para, activating): high para fraction, perhaps similar to 1.

Substances 2 (COOEt, meta): low para.

Substance 4 (NO2, meta): low para.

Substance 6 (COOH, meta): low para.

But how do the meta directors compare? Which has the highest para fraction among them? Maybe the least deactivating meta director would have a higher para fraction.

Wait, the substituents in 2,4,6 are all meta-directing, but their deactivating strengths vary.

Nitro (4) is more deactivating than COOEt (2), which is more than COOH (6? Wait, no. Benzoic acid is a stronger deactivating group because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group (due to the -COOH group), perhaps more than COOEt.

Wait, but in any case, the para fraction would be low for all meta directors. So their order among themselves might not matter much, but in terms of overall arrangement, the meta directors would be the lowest.

Now, putting it all together: the substances are to be arranged in order of INCREASING weight fraction of para isomer.

So the order would be:

Lowest para → highest para.

So first come the meta directors (2,4,6), then chlorobenzene (3), then toluene (1), then ethylbenzene (5).

Wait, but wait. The substituents in 1 and 5 are activating, so their para fractions are higher than 3, which is a deactivating ortho/para director.

Wait, no. Because in 3 (Cl), the substituent is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. But as an ortho/para director, the para product is a major product, but the fraction would be less than in activating groups.

So perhaps the order of para fractions is:

Substance 6 (COOH, meta) → Substance 4 (NO2, meta) → Substance 2 (COOEt, meta) → Substance 3 (Cl, ortho/para) → Substance 1 (toluene, ortho/para activating) → Substance 5 (ethyl, ortho/para activating).

Wait, but why would 6 be lower than 4 and 2? Because as a stronger deactivator, perhaps the para fraction is even lower? Or is it the substituent's ability to direct.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's nature affects how much para product is formed. So among the meta directors, the substituent that's more electron-withdrawing may lead to even lower para fractions? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's deactivating effect reduces the amount of para product, but the meta directors all have low para.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of the meta directors in terms of para fraction (from low to high) is 6 < 4 < 2.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps all meta directors have negligible para fractions, so their order among themselves isn't as important as their being lower than the ortho/para directors.

But the options given are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B) 6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Let me try to list the para fractions in order:

Meta directors (2,4,6) have low para fractions.

Ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher para fractions.

So the order from lowest to highest would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) → then chlorobenzene (3) → then toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order of the meta directors.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is as follows:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions. Among them, the one with the strongest deactivating group (like nitro, 4) would have lower para fractions than COOEt (2) and COOH (6)? Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, COOH is a stronger acid than COOEt, so perhaps it's more deactivating. So substituent in 6 is a stronger deactivator than 2 and 4. So perhaps the para fraction for 6 is lower than for 4 and 2.

Wait, but in reality, I'm not certain. Let me think of an example: which substituent directs more strongly to meta, making the para fraction even smaller.

Wait, I think the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than the COOEt or COOH groups. So, for nitrobenzene (4), the para fraction is lower than for ethyl benzoate (2) and benzoic acid (6)?

Wait, but I'm not confident. Wait, perhaps the para fraction depends on the substituent's ability to deactivate the ring. Wait, but the substituent's directing effect is more about where substitution occurs, not the reactivity. So perhaps regardless of how deactivating a substituent is, the para fraction is higher if the substituent is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substituent's directing effect only. So for meta directors, para is a minor product, and for ortho/para directors, para is a major product.

So, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be:

Substances 2,4,6 (meta directors) → substances 3 (Cl, ortho/para deactivating) → substances 1 and 5 (ortho/para activating).

But I need to arrange all six in order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 6 < 4 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5.

But looking at the options, option C is: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, no. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5

Which is 4, 2,6,3,1,5.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction for each substance:

Substance 4 (NO2, meta): Para fraction is very low.

Substance 6 (COOH, meta): Para fraction is low, but maybe higher than 4? Not sure.

Substance 2 (COOEt, meta): Para fraction is higher than 4 and 6.

Substance 3 (Cl, ortho/para): Para fraction is higher than 2,4,6.

Substance 1 (toluene, ortho/para, activating): high para.

Substance 5 (ethyl, ortho/para, activating): perhaps the highest.

Wait, so the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, but option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Hmm, but I thought 6 would be lower than 4. Alternatively, perhaps 6 has a lower para fraction than 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each substituent's effect on the para product.

Nitro (4) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So para product is minimal.

Benzoic acid (6) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So para product is also minimal.

Ethyl benzoate (2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So para product is minimal.

Chlorine (3) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So para product is significant but less than activating groups.

Toluene (1) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Para product is major.

Ethylbenzene (5) is similar.

So, the order from lowest to highest para fractions would be:

Substances 4,6,2 (all meta directors, so minimal para), then 3 (some para), then 1 and 5 (high para).

But how do 4,6,2 compare?

If 4 is more deactivating than 6, then para fraction in 4 is lower than in 6. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is the strongest deactivator, so 4 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 6, then 2.

So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Which would correspond to option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. No, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, no. If the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.

Another angle: the para fraction is the major product when the substituent is activating and/or ortho/para-directing. So, substances 1 and 5 (activating, ortho/para) have high para.

Substance 3 (deactivating, ortho/para) has moderate para.

Substances 2,4,6 (meta directors, deactivating) have low para.

Among meta directors, which has higher para fraction?

Perhaps the substituent that's less deactivating would allow for a higher para fraction.

So, among 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH), which is the least deactivating?

I think the order of deactivating strength is NO2 > COOH > COOEt. So, the para fraction would be higher in 2 (COOEt) than 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH). So the order from lowest to highest para in meta directors would be 6 <4 <2.

Thus, the order of para fractions would be:

6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, which option matches 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5? Looking at the options:

Option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4 is before 2 and 6.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because 3 comes after 1 and 5.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No, 5 and 1 are high.

Wait, none of the options exactly match 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5. Let me check all options again.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, because 6 comes after 2.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No, 5 and 1 are high, but 3 is after 1.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because 1 comes before 3, which is correct, but 4 is first.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of meta directors. Let me think again. If the para fraction for meta directors: 2 (COOEt) has higher para than 4 (NO2), which has higher than 6 (COOH).

Wait, but if 6 is the strongest deactivator, then perhaps the para fraction is the lowest, followed by 4, then 2.

So the order would be 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, does any option have this order?

Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The para fraction is the amount of the para product. For meta directors, the para product is minor, but perhaps in some cases, it's more than others.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent's position affects the possibility of para substitution.

Wait, perhaps for substituent 3 (Cl), being an ortho/para director, the para product is significant, perhaps more than in the meta directors. So in that case, the order would be 2,4,6 (meta) have lower para fractions, followed by 3, then 1, then 5.

But the actual options don't exactly match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. Does any option match that?

Looking at option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5 → No.

Looking at option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

So perhaps option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each substituent's effect on the para product.

Substance 1: Toluene (activating, ortho/para). So para product is major.

Substance 2: Ethyl benzoate (meta-directing, deactivating). Para product is minor.

Substance 3: Chlorobenzene (deactivating, ortho/para). Para product is major but less than activating groups.

Substance 4: Nitrobenzene (meta-directing, deactivating). Para product is minor.

Substance5: Ethylbenzene (activating, ortho/para). Para product is major.

Substance6: Benzoic acid (meta-directing, deactivating). Para product is minor.

So, the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) → then 3 → then 1 and 5.

Now, which meta director has the highest para fraction? Since they're all meta, perhaps the one that is least deactivating would have a higher para fraction. So COOEt (2) is less deactivating than nitro (4) and COOH (6). So the order among meta directors would be 6 <4 <2.

So, overall order:

6 (benzoic acid) → 4 (nitro) → 2 (ethyl benzoate) → 3 (chlorobenzene) →1 (toluene) →5 (ethylbenzene).

So the sequence is 6 <4 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none of the options exactly match this. Let me check each option:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, 4 is first.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → No, 5 and 1 are high.

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the order among 2,3,4,6 is different.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction for 3 (chlorobenzene, ortho/para, deactivating) is lower than that of 1 and 5.

So, the order would be:

Meta directors (2,4,6) → 3 → 1 and 5.

But the meta directors' order might be 4 <6 <2.

So the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3 → No, because 3 comes after 1 and 5.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but none of the options match. So I must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the actual products' ratios.

For example:

Chlorobenzene (3): when brominated, the major products are ortho and para. The para isomer is more than the ortho because it's less hindered. So the para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating substituents.

Toluene (1): the para fraction is around 30-40%, perhaps.

Ethylbenzene (5): perhaps similar to toluene.

Ethyl benzoate (2): para fraction is low, as meta is the main product.

Nitrobenzene (4): para fraction is very low.

Benzoic acid (6): para fraction is very low.

So, the overall order would be from the lowest para fraction to highest:

4 (lowest) →6 →2 →3 →1 →5 (highest).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none match this. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, according to this, the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But according to my analysis, 3 (chlorobenzene) should come after 2, but before 1 and 5.

So perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5. But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether substance 5 (ethylbenzene) has a higher para fraction than 1 (toluene). I think toluene has a higher para fraction because the methyl group is smaller, leading to less steric hindrance. So in ethylbenzene, the para product is still major, but perhaps less than toluene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps both 1 and 5 have similar para fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Because in option A, the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. But according to my analysis, 6 should come before 2 (because 6 is more deactivating, so para fraction is lower), so 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction for 2 (ethyl benzoate) is higher than 6 and 4. So the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Because in this option, 3 comes after 1 and 5, which have higher para fractions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer as option A.

But I'm getting stuck. I'll try to think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative activating/deactivating effects and how they influence the para fraction.

Substances that are activating (1,5) will have higher para fractions.

Substances that are deactivating (3) but ortho/para will have lower but still significant para fractions.

Substances that are meta directors (2,4,6) will have very low para fractions.

Among meta directors, the order of para fractions from lowest to highest would be 4 <6 <2.

Because nitro is the strongest deactivator, then COOH, then COOEt.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Hmm, that would imply that 1 and 5 come before 3, which doesn't align with my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for chlorobenzene (3), the para fraction is lower than for activating groups but higher than meta directors.

So, the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

This sequence isn't present in the options. The closest is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in ordering 2,4,6. Let me think: which substituent in 2,4,6 has the highest para fraction?

If substituent 2 (COOEt) is the least deactivating, then its para fraction is higher than 4 and 6.

So the order among meta directors is 4 <6 <2.

So the overall order is:

4 (lowest) →6 →2 →3 (chlorobenzene) →1→5 (highest).

Thus, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options again:

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No. Option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

No.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the para fraction for each substance.

Substance 1: Toluene → para is major (say ~35%).

Substance 2: Ethyl benzoate → para is minor (~5%).

Substance 3: Chlorobenzene → para is major (~30-40%).

Substance4: Nitrobenzene → para is minor (~5%).

Substance5: Ethylbenzene → para is major (~35%).

Substance6: Benzoic acid → para is minor (~5%).

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

4 (5%), 6 (5%), 2 (5%), 3 (30%), 1 (35%), 5 (35%).

Wait, but 4 and 6 would both be around 5%, but I think 4 has less because nitro is a stronger deactivator. So 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should look for the correct option based on standard directing effects.

The correct order of the substances in terms of para fraction (from lowest to highest) would be:

Substances with meta directors (2,4,6) → then 3 (Cl, ortho/para) → then 1 and 5 (activating ortho/para).

Among meta directors, the stronger deactivators have lower para fractions. So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But according to my analysis, 3 comes after 2.

So perhaps the correct option is option C, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.

I think the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but since no option matches, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But wait, perhaps I should think again. If the substituent is more deactivating, the product's para fraction is even lower.

So, the order of para fractions:

Nitro (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).

Which is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

No, 3 comes after 1 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, in the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So, according to this, the order is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Which would imply that 3 has the highest para fraction, which is incorrect because 1 and 5 have higher.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the para fraction for chlorobenzene (3) is lower than that of toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5), but higher than meta directors.

So, the order would be 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, none of the options match.

I think I've exhausted all options. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to the answer.


To determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their bromination products, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be either ortho/para-directing (activating or deactivating) or meta-directing (deactivating). The para fraction depends on the substituent's directing effect and its influence on the reactivity of the ring.

### Analysis of Each Substance:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para product being a major fraction.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl Benzoate)**: The ethyl ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with only a minor fraction of the para product.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para product being a significant fraction, though less than in activating groups.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with only a minor fraction of the para product.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the ortho and para positions, with the para product being a major fraction.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**: The carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, with only a minor fraction of the para product.

### Order of Increasing Para Fraction:
- **Meta-directing groups (substances 2, 4, 6)**: These have the lowest para fractions because the para product is minor compared to the meta product.
- **Chlorobenzene (substance 3)**: As an ortho/para-directing but deactivating group, the para fraction is higher than meta-directing groups but lower than activating groups.
- **Toluene (substance 1) and Ethylbenzene (substance 5)**: These have the highest para fractions due to their activating, ortho/para-directing groups, which favor para substitution.

### Final Order:
The substances are arranged in increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer as follows:
**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**

### Matching with Options:
The correct order corresponds to **Option C: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**, but this does not perfectly align with the derived order. However, based on the analysis, **Option C** is the closest match.
