Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. They've given the stability constants for the different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The general formula for these complexes is Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), I think. So the different β values correspond to different numbers of SCN- ligands attached.

Wait, the problem is asking specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^(0) complex, which is blue. So that's the third complex, maybe? Because the β values are given in order: β1, β2, β3, β4. So β3 is 63, which is the highest of the given values except for β4 which is 16. Wait, no, 63 is highest. So the third complex is the most stable.

Wait, wait, what's the order of the complexes? The first one (β1=9) is Co(SCN)^(+), I think. Because each SCN- is a -1 charge. So Co^2+ with one SCN- would be Co(SCN)^+. Then β2=40 would be Co(SCN)_2^0 (neutral). β3=63 is Co(SCN)_3^-2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the charge would be 2+ -3*(-1) = 2-3 = -1. Wait, no, wait: Co^2+ plus three SCN- (each -1) would be 2-3 = -1. So the charge is -1 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But wait, the problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN
