Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think refers to the orbital period of the two stars around each other.

Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars.

Wait, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method gives the velocity semi-amplitudes of the stars. The velocities are related to the masses. Oh right, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's moving less in the center of mass. So the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses.

Let me think about the binary system. The two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves slower, the less massive one moves faster. So the velocity amplitude (K) is related to the mass ratio.

The formula I remember is K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, let me get that right. The mass ratio is M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). Because the product of each mass and velocity is the same (since they're orbiting each other, their momentum must be equal and opposite). So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Therefore, M1/M2 = K2 / K1.

But wait, the problem states that each system has two stars, so each system has two masses. For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1a is 10, K1b is 5. Similarly, system_2: K2a is 15, K2b is 10.

Wait, but each system has two stars. So for system_1, M1a and M1b (masses of each star) are such that M1a * 10 = M1
