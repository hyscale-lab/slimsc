Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries all the operators must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. I think in SMEFT, all operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. That rules out options that don't include 1.

Wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare symmetry would require the theory to be invariant under translations, which means the theory must be renormalizable or something? Or maybe it's more about the possibility of adding terms. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's not renormalizable but valid up to some cutoff scale. But do the operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Since Poincare includes translations, I think effective field theories generally do respect Poincare because they're formulated in a way that includes all possible terms, but maybe the question is whether all operators must respect it. 

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also momentum conservation. Or maybe the operators in SMEFT are constructed in such a way that they respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which already includes Poincare. Or wait, do all
