Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Let me think about each compound one by one. I remember that a compound is optically active if it has a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. Alternatively, it can have a plane of symmetry or some other element that would make it non-chiral. So I need to check each compound for the presence of chiral centers or any other factors that might prevent optical activity.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2-? No, wait, let me think again. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the butene is four carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (but-1-ene). So C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and a single bond to what else? Maybe a methyl group? So C1 has Cl, CH2CH2 (wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So C1 is CH2Cl, but wait, no. The structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's write it: the structure is CHCl=CHCH(CH3). Wait no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and a double bond to C2. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps more accurately, C1 is CHCl attached to a double bond. Wait, but that would be CHCl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because it's but-1-ene. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, but-1-ene has the double bond starting at C1. So, the molecule would be ClCH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but that's a single bond. Hmm. Maybe it's better to think about substituents. Oh wait, maybe it's (Z)-configuration. But regardless, is there a chiral center here?

Wait, for a chiral center, the carbon must have four different groups. Let's look at each carbon. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, and is double-bonded to C2, so it's spÂ² hybridized. So any
