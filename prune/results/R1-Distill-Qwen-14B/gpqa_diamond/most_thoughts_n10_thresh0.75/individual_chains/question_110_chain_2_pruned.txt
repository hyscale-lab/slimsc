Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me start by recalling what each spectrograph can observe.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag", so that's apparent V magnitude less than 17. Like, lower numbers are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, the star's V must be ≤17.

And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so their apparent V must be ≤16. Because brighter than 16 means magnitude less than 16. So a star must be brighter (smaller magnitude) than 16 to be seen by HIRES.

So the star must be visible to both, which means it needs to have an apparent V magnitude ≤16, because HIRES requires that. Because if a star's magnitude is, say, 17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So the star must be ≤16.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. Because the question is, which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤17 ( ESPRESSO can detect it) and ≤16 (HIRES can detect it). So the stricter condition is that the apparent V must be ≤16. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 for both to see it. Because if it's 16.5, then HIRES can't see it (since 16.5>16), but ESPRESSO can. So only stars with apparent V ≤16 can be seen by both.

But wait, let me recheck. The question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star that is brighter than 17 mag in V would have apparent magnitude less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V magnitude 1
