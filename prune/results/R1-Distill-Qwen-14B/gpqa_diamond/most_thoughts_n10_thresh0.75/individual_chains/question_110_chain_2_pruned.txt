Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different brightness limits for the stars they can observe.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. I need to figure out which can be detected by both instruments.

First, I should probably understand the brightness requirements for each spectrograph. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means any star with V <17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So the limit is brighter than 17 mag, meaning their V magnitude is less than 17. So any star with apparent magnitude (V) less than 17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.

So the star needs to have V <17 for ESPRESSO and V <16 for HIRES. Wait, wait. No, wait: the problem says, with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, so if a star's V is less than 17, that's brighter than 17, so it's observable. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed (so V <16).

So the star must have V <16 to be detected by both, because to be seen by HIRES, it must be brighter than 16, which is stricter than ESPRESSO's 17 limit.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. Because the star's apparent magnitude is what matters. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude that is less than both 17 (for ESPRESSO) and 16 (for HIRES). So the stricter condition is V <16. So the star's apparent V must be â‰¤15.999... So only stars with V <16 can be seen by both.

Wait, but wait, the problem says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESP
