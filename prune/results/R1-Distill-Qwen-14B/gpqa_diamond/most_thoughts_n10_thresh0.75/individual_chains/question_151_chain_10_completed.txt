Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me take a deep breath and think through this step by step.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think I should normalize that, right? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to have a norm of 1. Let me compute the norm first. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. So that's sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Then there's this observable P, which is a matrix. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). The third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P looks like this:

[ 0        1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2     0        1/√2   ]
[0        1/√2     0      ]

I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I guess I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0, then find the corresponding eigenvector, and compute the probability.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the observable is P, and I need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with that eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that inner product gives the probability.

Alternatively, maybe I don't need to find the eigenvectors. Let me think. Alternatively, if P is a projection operator, perhaps it's orthogonal projections, but I don't know if that's the case here. Wait, looking at P, it's a 3x3 matrix, and its elements seem symmetric. Let me check if P is Hermitian because observables must be Hermitian. To check, I'll look at the elements. The (1,2) element is 1/√2, so the (2,1) element is also 1/√2. The (1,3) element is 0, same as (3,1). The (2,3) is 1/√2, (3,2) is 1/√2. So yes, P is symmetric, which means it's Hermitian. So that's good.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's compute the characteristic equation: det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix (P - λ I) is:

[ -λ       1/√2      0       ]
[1/√2     -λ       1/√2    ]
[0        1/√2     -λ      ]

The determinant of this matrix is the product of the diagonals minus the sum of the products of the off-diagonal elements, but for a 3x3, it's a bit more involved. Let me write it out:

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
     - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
     + 0 * [ ... ] (since the third element in first row is 0, that term drops out)

So expanding:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] 
- (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] 
+ 0 

So that's:

-λ³ + (λ/2) ) 
+ (1/√2)(λ/√2) 

Wait, let me compute each part.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] = -λ^3 + (λ/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * ( -λ/√2 ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) ) = λ/(2)

So summing together:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ(-λ² +1) = 0.

So the solutions are λ=0, and -λ² +1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1? Hmm, that's possible. But the observable's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring 0. So the eigenvalue 0 is present, so the probability is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state in the eigenspace of 0.

So, the next step is to find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So, for P |ψ> = 0 |ψ>, or (P)|ψ> = 0.

So, the system (P)|ψ> = 0.

Let me write the equations for λ=0.

The matrix P is as before. So for |ψ> = [x, y, z]^T.

Equation 1: 0 * x + (1/√2) y + 0 * z = 0 → (1/√2) y = 0 → y=0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) x + 0 * y + (1/√2) z = 0 → (x + z)/√2 = 0 → x + z = 0 → z = -x.

Equation 3: 0 * x + (1/√2) y + 0 * z = 0 → same as equation 1, y=0.

So from equation 1: y=0.

From equation 2: z = -x.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form [x, 0, -x]^T. So any vector like x*(1, 0, -1)^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with eigenvectors being scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1)^T.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T, because the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )=sqrt(2), so we divide each component by sqrt(2).

Now, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T, which I normalized earlier to (1/sqrt(6))* [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. The original state is given as (-1, 2, 1). But in quantum mechanics, the state must be a unit vector. So I should first normalize it. So the normalized state is |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

So the probability is the square of the magnitude of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> corresponding to λ=0.

The eigenvector I found is |v> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product <v | ψ> is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Let me compute that:

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

So adding them gives (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Wait, because each term is -1/(sqrt(12)), so two terms sum to -2/sqrt(12).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so sqrt(12)=2*1.732≈3.464.

So the inner product is (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the inner product more carefully.

Wait, let me redo the inner product calculation.

Inner product: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ].

Adding these gives [ (-1 -1) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

But sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so this becomes (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The magnitude is 1/sqrt(3), so the square is 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. What if I made a mistake in the eigenvectors?

Another approach: perhaps using the observable P and the state vector, compute the expectation value, but wait, no. The question is only about the probability of measuring 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable P is diagonal in a certain basis. But I think the approach I took is correct.

So the answer should be 1/3, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we begin by normalizing the given state vector. The state vector is initially given as \( (-1, 2, 1) \). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( P \) to yield \( 0 \), we need to determine the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \( 0 \). Solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), we find that the eigenvectors for \( \lambda = 0 \) are of the form:

\[
|v\rangle = x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix},
\]

where \( x \) is a scalar. Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the magnitude of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + 0 \cdot \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \right) + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
