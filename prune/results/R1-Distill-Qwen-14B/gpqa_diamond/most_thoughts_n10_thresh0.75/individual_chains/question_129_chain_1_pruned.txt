Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a reaction pathway question, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's see, the question gives several steps and some hints. I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll try to outline the reaction steps and what each might imply. Then I'll look at the hints to get more clues.

The reaction steps are:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR spectra: A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are A to D.

Hmm. Let's break down each step.

Starting with A reacting with HCN to form B. HCN is a nucleophile, so probably A has a carbonyl group. When a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, but no, wait. HCN can also add to a carbonyl in a different way. Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it might form a cyanohydrin, which is an addition product. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is in a cyclic structure, maybe it's a ring-opening addition. Or perhaps A is an aldehyde or ketone, and B is the corresponding cyanohydrin.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B is a nitrile, when reduced with H2 and Pd, it would form an amine. Wait, but HCN adds as a nucleophile. Wait, when you add HCN to a carbonyl, the product is a cyanohydrin (like a geminal diol but with a nitrile). Wait, no, a cyanohydrin is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. Let me think: R-CO-R' + HCN → R-C(OH)-CN-R'? Or R-CH(OH)-CN. Wait, no, maybe structure-wise, it's R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the reaction. The carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with HCN. The O might attack the H, and the C from HCN attacks the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be R-C(OH)-CN, but as an addition product. Wait, but wait, maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl, so the product would be RCH(OH)CN? But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is in a cyclic structure, perhaps it's a ring opening.

Wait, let me think again. If A is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone, and it reacts with HCN, you could get a cyanohydrin. So for example, cyclopentanone plus HCN would form 3-cyclopenten-1-ylidene propan-2-ol or something? Wait, no, maybe the product would be a six-membered ring with the cyan and hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but perhaps I should look at the reduction step. So B is the product of A and HCN. Then B is hydrogenated (reduction) to form C. So if B is a nitrile, then C would be an amine after reduction. Wait, but how? Wait, nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would form amines. For example, RCN + H2 → RCH2NH2. But maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, if B is an alkyne, but I don't think so because HCN adds to carb
