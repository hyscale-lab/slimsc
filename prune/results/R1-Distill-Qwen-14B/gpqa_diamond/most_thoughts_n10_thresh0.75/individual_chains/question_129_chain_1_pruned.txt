Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four reactions involved, and each gives a new compound: A → B → C → D → E. Plus, there are some hints and an IR spectrum clue, so I'll need to use all that information.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step. 

First, compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B. HCN is a nucleophile, and when it reacts with carbonyl compounds, it typically forms cyanohydrins. Wait, but wait—another possibility: if A is a ketone, then HCN would add to the carbonyl group, making a cyanohydrin. So A is probably a ketone since the product B would then be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. Alternatively, if A were an aldehyde, HCN would add to that as well, making a primary cyanohydrin. But the next step involves reduction with H2 and Pd, so maybe that's relevant.

Next step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 in presence of a catalyst like Pd is usually for hydrogenation. So if B is a nitrile (from HCN addition), then hydrogenation would reduce the nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, HCN adds to a carbonyl to make a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a cyanide attached. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, HCN adds to a ketone (say, R2CO) to form R2C(OH)CN. So that's the cyanohydrin. Then, when B is hydrogenated, the double bond (if any) in B would be hydrogenated. But wait, in the cyanohydrin, the O is connected to H and CN. So perhaps the next step is to hydrogenate the nitrile group?

Wait, no, hydrogenation of an aldehyde or ketone would reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol. But in this case, B is a cyanohydrin which has an OH group and a CN group attached to the same carbon. So when you
