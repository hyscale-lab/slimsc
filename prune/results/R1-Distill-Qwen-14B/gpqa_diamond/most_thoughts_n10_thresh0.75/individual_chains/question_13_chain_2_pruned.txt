Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, and it's a major component in citrus essential oils. The (R) configuration means it's the enantiomer where the isopropyl group is on a specific side. Wait, no, wait. Limonene has a specific structure—a bicyclic monoterpene, right? I think it's a bicyclic structure with a double bond. Oh right, limonene has a structure similar to menthol but with a bicyclic system and a double bond.

So, the first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's hydrogenation. Stirred with palladium on carbon, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So, the double bond in limonene is going to be hydrogenated. But wait, how many equivalents of hydrogen are used? The question says 1 equivalent is consumed. So, probably just a single double bond hydrogenation.

What's the structure of limonene? Limonene has a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. Oh wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene—specifically, it's a substituted cyclohexene. The structure is such that it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, I think. So, it's a bicyclic structure with a double bond. When we hydrogenate that, the double bond (the ene part) becomes a single bond. So the product after hydrogenation would be bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, which is a bicyclic cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, no, actually limonene is a bicyclic compound where the double bond is in a specific position. Let me think. Limonene structure: it has a bridged bicyclic structure, like norbornene. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So product 1 is that hydrogenated form,
