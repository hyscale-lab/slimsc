Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. I think I need to find the concentration of acetic acid after this dilution first.

Wait, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial moles are M1 * V1. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. Oh wait, I should convert cm³ to liters? No, wait, actually it's okay because when you divide, the volume units will cancel out as long as you're consistent. So V1 is 20, V2 is 40. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (HC2H3O2) and NaOH (a strong base) would produce sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2) and water. So the solution at equivalence will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. Since sodium acetate dissociates completely, the solution will be basic because the acetate ion is a weak base.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb of acetate. Let's see.

First, find the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is also 0.001 moles since it's a 1:1 reaction.

But wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH required for equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the problem is asking for 25% titration. Oh wait, no, the question is about the pH at 25% and at equivalence. So I need to calculate both.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "What will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point?" So I need to find pH at two points: one where 25%
