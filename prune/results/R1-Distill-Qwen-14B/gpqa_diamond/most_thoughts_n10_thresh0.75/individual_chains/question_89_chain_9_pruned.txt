Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what each step does.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH—sounds like an elimination reaction, maybe. But wait, KOH is a strong base. Oh right, elimination reactions typically form alkenes. Since there are two bromine atoms on the adamantane, perhaps an E2 elimination occurs, removing both Brs and forming a double bond. Wait, but wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So maybe when KOH is added, it deprotonates something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since it's dibrominated, perhaps KOH leads to the formation of a diene or a single double bond.

Looking at the product 1's NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H, probably a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an epoxide?), but wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group. Oh, that makes more sense. So product 1 might be a ketone. How?

Wait, another thought. When 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but also, since KOH is in excess, maybe it's a di-elimination. Alternatively, could it be a substitution reaction? But substitution would form an alcohol or something else. Hmm.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide?
