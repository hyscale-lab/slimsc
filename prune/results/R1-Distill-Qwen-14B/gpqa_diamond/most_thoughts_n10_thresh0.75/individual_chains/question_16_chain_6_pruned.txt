Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. Let's take them one by one and analyze each.

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers or some other form of asymmetry, like a planar chirality. Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So, my plan is to check each compound for such features.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   The structure here is an alkene with substituents. Let me visualize it. The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with chloro and methyl groups. Wait, the structure is (Z) configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3, but also with substituents.

   Wait, no, the actual structure: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond at position 1. So wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-C=CH-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, it's perhaps CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon (which is part of the double bond). So structure is Cl-CH2-C=CH-CH3? No, maybe it's Cl attached to the double bond carbon. Wait, position 1 is the first carbon, so
