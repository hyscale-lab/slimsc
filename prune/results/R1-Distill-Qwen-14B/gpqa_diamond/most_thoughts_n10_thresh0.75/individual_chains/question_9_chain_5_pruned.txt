Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotational symmetry combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe it's the combination of a C3 rotation and a horizontal reflection? Wait, no, the h in C3h refers to a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal, perpendicular to the main axis.

So, looking at the options, I need to figure out which of these molecules has that kind of symmetry.

The options are:
A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I'm not super familiar with all these structures, but I'll try to recall or visualize them.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I think that's (i-Pr)3BO. Triisopropyl borane, but as borate which would have an oxygen? Wait, no, triisopropyl borate would be (i-Pr)3B(O-) with some counterion, maybe. But the structure is three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, but when three are attached, how does that affect the molecule's symmetry?

Boron in the center with three identical isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a (CH(CH3)2) group. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. It's trigonal planar around boron, so the molecule would have a C3v symmetry perhaps? Or maybe C3h. Because each isopropyl is symmetric, so rotation by 120 degrees would bring the molecule into itself. Also, there might be a mirror plane through boron and each isopropyl. Wait, but for C3h, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, I think triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with each substituent symmetric. So, the symmetry would be higher. Wait, trigonal planar is usually C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane. But for C3h, which has a horizontal mirror, maybe it's more of a three-fold rotation plus a horizontal reflection.

Another option is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane structure, I believe. Its structure is like a norbornane but with an amine group. Quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. Let me think about its molecular structure. It's a bridged bicyclic compound with a seven-membered ring, but wait, no, norbornane
