Okay, so I've got this problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The question says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex because dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands.

Wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that's the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. But I'm not entirely sure about the color and which β corresponds to which complex. Wait, in the stability constants, the order is β1, β2, β3, β4. So I think each β corresponds to the complex with that many SCN- ions.

So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^0? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, each β is the formation constant for the next complex. So β1 is the constant for the first step: Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ with β1=9.

Similarly, β2 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, and β2 is 40. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be β1 * β2? Or wait, no. Wait, the stability constant for each step is the log of the formation constant for that step. So the overall for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+} is the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how these constants work. So, the overall formation constant K (β) for a complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is the product of the individual stepwise constants. So for the first complex, [
