Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the higher β complexes are favored. But wait, the order of β here is β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the order from highest β to lowest is β3=63, β2=40, β4=16, β1=9. Wait no, wait: β3 is the highest, then β2, then β4, then β1. So the most stable complex is Co(SCN)_3^2+ (assuming each β corresponds to the number of SCN- ions attached). Wait, but I'm not sure about the order. Let me think: β1 is for the first complex, which is probably [Co(SCN)]^+. Then β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}? Or maybe the other way around. Oh wait, perhaps the β values are for complexes with different numbers of ligands. Each β corresponds to adding another ligand. So β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand, the first complex. Then β2 is the formation constant for adding the second ligand, so the second complex, and so on.

But wait, when calculating the distribution of species, each subsequent β is the constant for each additional ligand. So the overall formation constant for the third complex would be β1 * β2 * β3, right? Because each step multiplies the previous one. Or is each β independent? Wait, no, stability constants are cumulative. So for Co(SCN)_n, the overall β is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Or wait, maybe β1 is [CoSCN]/([Co][SCN]), β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]/([CoSCN][SCN]), so the overall β for the second complex is β1 * β2. Similarly, β3 is the next step, so the overall β for the third complex is β1 * β2 * β3.

Wait, but the problem statement gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each additional SCN- added, that's the respective β. So the overall β for each complex is the product up to that point.

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions attached, so that's the second complex. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So what is the percentage of this species relative to all the Co species.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, given the total Co concentration and the SCN- concentration.

I think the formula for each species involves the formation constants and the concentration of ligand. The general approach is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex, considering the total concentration of Co.

Let me think. The total cobalt concentration is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But the solution starts with Co^2+ and SCN-; the complexes form based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

To find the fraction of each complex, we can model it using the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each complex can be found using the expression:

For each complex, f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the denominator is the product of β's up to that step, multiplied by [SCN]^n, where n is the number of ligands. Hmm.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of each species is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / sum for all m from 0 to 4 of (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m), where m=0 is just 1 (since [Co^2+] is the case with zero ligands, which would have a term of 1, but β1β2...β0 is 1, and [SCN]^0 is 1).

Wait, but in this case, the complexes are Co^2+ (m=0), CoSCN+ (m=1), Co(SCN)_2 (m=2), Co(SCN)_3^- (m=3), Co(SCN)_4^{2-} (m=4). The stability constant for each complex is the product of β's up to that m. So for m=1, it's β1; for m=2, it's β1*β2; for m=3, β1*β2*β3; for m=4, β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The formation of the first complex [CoSCN]^+ is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+. The stability constant K1 is [CoSCN]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) ) = β1 =9.

Then the second complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, formed by [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0. The stability constant for this step is β2=40. So the overall K for the second complex is K1*K2 = β1*β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, the third complex would have K_total = β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. And the fourth would be β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= let's see, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16= 362880.

Wait, but the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the step-wise formation constant. So for each complex, the overall β is the product up to that point.

Now, the fractions for each species are given by:

f_m = (β1β2...βm [SCN]^m) / denominator,

where denominator = sum over m=0
