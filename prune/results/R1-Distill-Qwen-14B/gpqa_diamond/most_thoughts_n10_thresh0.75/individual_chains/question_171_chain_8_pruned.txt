Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I remember that this involves substituents on a benzene ring reacting with an electrophile, like bromine. The question is about the para-isomer yields for different substituents. I need to arrange the substances 1-6 in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Let me list out the substituents again:

1) ะก6H5-CH3 (methyl)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (ethoxy carbonyl, maybe an ester group)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorine)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro group)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl)
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, no, actually, looking again:

1) Is benzyl with a methyl group. So, substituent is -CH3.
2) The group is -COOEt (since COOC2H5 is the ester group, ethyl ester).
3) -Cl
4) -NO2
5) -C2H5 (ethyl)
6) -COOH (carboxylic acid)

Now, in electrophilic substitution, the substituents can activate or deactivate the ring. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, and deactivating make it less. Also, they can be ortho/para directors or meta directors.

The yield of para isomer depends on the substituent's directing effects. For example, strong activating groups (like -OCH3) are strong para/ortho directors, so para product is major. Deactivating groups, like nitro, are meta directors, so para isomer would be less.

But wait, in this problem, they are asking about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, I need to determine how much the para product is formed, and then arrange them from least to most.

Let me think about each substituent:

1) -CH3 (methyl): This is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group). It is an ortho/para director. So, the substitution would occur more at ortho and para positions. So, para is a major product. But wait, sometimes when the substituent is bulky, the para might be more favored. Methyl is a small group, so I think para and ortho would both be possible. But in bromination with excess Br2, perhaps the para is the major isomer, but I'm not sure about the exact yield.

2) -COOEt (ester group): The ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So, it's a deactivating group. So, it's a meta director. Wait, but wait: I think esters (like -COOR) are ortho/para directors because the lone pairs from the oxygen can donate through resonance, but the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Hmm, wait. Let me think: the ester group is actually a meta director. Because the carbonyl is EWG, making the ring less reactive. Wait, no, wait. Alkyl groups
