Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's observations and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me think through this.

So the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. And below that wavelength, the flux drops a lot. Wait, what does that mean? Oh, right! I remember that the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward (shorter wavelengths) of the Lyman-alpha emission line at about 121.6 nm. But wait, that's in the ultraviolet. So if the flux drops below 790 nm, maybe that's due to the Lyman limit or something else. Or perhaps it's because of some absorption feature caused by the quasar's environment, like the Lyman-alpha emission being shifted.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm could be due to a specific emission line, like the Lyman-alpha line. But wait, Lyman-alpha is at 121.6 nm in the quasar's rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that's much longer. So that suggests redshift. Because if the universe is expanding, the wavelength stretches when the light travels to us.

So using the formula for redshift: observed wavelength 位_obs = (1 + z) * 位_rest. Here, 位_rest for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. So if 位_obs is 790 nm,
