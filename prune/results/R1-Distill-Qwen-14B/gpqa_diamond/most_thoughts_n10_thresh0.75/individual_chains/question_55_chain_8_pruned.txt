Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what I can do. I've just started learning about NMR, so I'm a bit shaky, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm. Let me recall what these peaks might correspond to. Acetates typically have an ester group. The structure of an acetate is OAc (O-CO-OCH2CH3 or similar). So, the compound is an ester where the acyl group is attached to an oxygen, and the other part is an alkene, probably, because the options are about propenyl and butenyl groups.

So, the structure would be something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, propenyl groups are CH2=CH2CH2- but wait, more accurately, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Similarly, butenyl would be longer, like CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

Wait, but the options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, and whether they are cis or trans. So, the structure would be, for example, cis or trans in the case of a double bond adjacent to the ester group.

Let me think. The ester group is OAc-O-CO-O-R, wait no, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. So, in this case, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and the R' is methyl (since the acetate is OAc where OAc is O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester. So the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait, no. Wait, acetate is the ester formed from acetic acid. So the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is from the acid. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no, that would be a carbonate. No, wait, no. The ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is the acyl group. So in acetate, R is the alkyl group attached to the oxygen, and R' is the acetyl group (CH3CO-). So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3.

So, for example, propenyl acet
