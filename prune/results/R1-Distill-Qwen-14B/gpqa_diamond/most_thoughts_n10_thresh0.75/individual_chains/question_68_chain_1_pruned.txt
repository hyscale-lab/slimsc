Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin 1/2 particles have their spin angular momentum in units of ħ/2. So, the possible spin states are either up or down along a given axis.

The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin component along the z-axis, right? So mu = γ S_z. Gamma must be the gyromagnetic ratio, which relates the magnetic moment to the angular momentum.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change. The options are given in terms of gamma and B, so I need to figure out how the system's state evolves when the magnetic field switches direction.

Hmm, when the magnetic field is in the z-direction, the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sz. But when it switches to the y-direction, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. Wait, because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field via the Zeeman term, which is -mu·B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to -mu · B. 

Wait, more accurately, the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. Since mu is γ S_z, then H = -γ S_z B. But when the field is along y, mu·B becomes γ S_z B_y? No, because B is now in y-direction, so mu·B = γ S_z * B_y? Wait, no, because mu is a vector. Wait, no, mu is γ Sz. So when B is in +Y, mu·B would be γ Sz * B_y. Wait, no, more correctly, mu·B is the dot product, so for B along y, it's mu_y * B. Because B is along y, B = (0, B, 0). So mu·B = mu_y * B. But mu is γ Sz, so mu_y is γ (S^y). Wait, no. Wait, mu is a vector, so mu = γ S, because S is a vector operator. So mu · B is γ S · B. So if B is along y, then S · B would be S_y * B. So H = -γ B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian after the field switch is H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is when the field is along z. So the initial state would be an eigenstate of Sz. Because when the magnetic field is along z, the system's energy eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along z. So the initial state is |+z> or |-z>?

Wait, the question says the magnetic moment is aligned with the field. The field is along +Z, so the magnetic moment mu is aligned with it. Since mu = gamma S_z, then S_z is positive
