Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, the given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I remember that the decay properties of particles are related to their lifetimes and the uncertainty principle.

Wait, right, the mean lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the total decay width. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation. Oh, right, the uncertainty principle says that the lifetime uncertainty Δt is about ħ/ΔE, so in this case, the width Γ is the energy uncertainty, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I need to convert the units properly. Γ is given in MeV. Oh, right, 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

But to use this in natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So, let me compute τ: ħ / Γ. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait. There's another factor. The mean decay length depends on the velocity of the particle. Because the particle is moving, the decay length is velocity multiplied by the lifetime, right? So the formula should be L = v * c * τ. Because velocity is v, and c is the speed of light. So I need to find v, the velocity of the meson.

To find v, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, so the particle is ultra-relativistic, which means v is approximately c. But let's compute it accurately.

The energy E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And the momentum p = γ m v. So the relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Let me see, but since E is given, and m is known, perhaps I can compute the momentum p.

Wait, but I'm more interested in the velocity. Let me see: since E = γ m c², and p = γ m v. So we can write p = (E² - (m c²)²)^(1/2) / c² * v. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the velocity can be found from the relation γ = E/(m c²). Let me compute gamma: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.
