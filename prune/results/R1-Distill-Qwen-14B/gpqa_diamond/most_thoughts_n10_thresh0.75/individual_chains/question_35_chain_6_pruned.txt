Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, of a muon. The operator Ay is given by a 2x2 matrix, and it's equal to c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row being (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which statement among the options is correct.

Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. For a spin-½ particle, like a muon, the angular momentum components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices are 2x2, which fits with this problem.

So, the matrix S given here looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly what S is here. So, Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π). Wait, but wait a second—what's the standard expression for the spin component operators?

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator S for a spin-½ particle is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So, for example, Sy would be (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But here, Ay is given as c * S, with c = h/(4π). Let me compute what c is in terms of ħ.

I know that h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h = 2π ħ. Substituting into c: c = (2π ħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2. Oh wait, that's interesting because the standard Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is exactly the standard Sy operator. 

So Ay is the same as the usual Sy operator. Therefore, the eigenvalues for Ay should be the same as for Sy. For spin-½ particles, the eigenvalues of the spin components are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a of Ay will be a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me make sure. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So Ay has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, which in terms of h would be h/(2π * 2) = h/(4π) multiplied by 2, no wait. Wait, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. Wait, no, wait, S in this case is the Pauli matrix, which for Sy is (ħ/2) Sy matrix. Or wait, no—wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's be precise. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, so Sy is (ħ/2) σy. So in the problem, Ay = c * S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So comparing to the standard Sy, which is (ħ/2) σy, so S here is σy, so Ay = c * σy. So what is c? c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, the standard σy is 2i times the standard Pauli matrix? No, wait, no. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], exactly as given for S in the problem. So the operator Ay is c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, but the standard spin Y operator is (ħ/2) * σy. So let's compute (h/(4π
