Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of organic chemistry reactions and chromatography. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The compounds in question are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on both standard and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that mCPBA is a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. So in both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the alkenes are reacting with mCPBA.

Wait, but the initial compounds are (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene. Let me draw their structures. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle, right? So for (E), the higher priority groups on each carbon (the 4th and 5th carbons) are on opposite sides. For (Z), they're on the same side.

In epoxidation, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific and proceeds through a cyclic transition state. So, for each starting alkene, the reaction will form a specific epoxide.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For an epoxidation, the peracid adds across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide. So, when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, what's the product? Similarly for (Z).

Wait, no. Wait a second. Actually, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is a peracid epoxidation which is a syn addition. Because the peracid adds the oxygen across the double bond in a way that both oxygen atoms are added to the same face.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. The peracid approach is through a cyclic transition state. The peracid attacks the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen bonds form on adjacent carbons, and since the transition state is cyclic, the configuration of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's stereochemistry.

Wait, let's think about the syn addition. Let me take an example. If the alkene is trans (E), then the two high-priority groups are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a way that the substituents on either end of the epoxide are on the same side. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the diastereomers. When an epoxide is formed from a trans (E) alkene, the resulting epoxide will have the two substituents on the same side (cis), because the peracid adds the oxygen
