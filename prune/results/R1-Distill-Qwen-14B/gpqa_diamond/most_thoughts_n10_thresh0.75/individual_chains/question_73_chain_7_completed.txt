Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember some key formulas. 

First, the problem states that one astronaut has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and the other has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as subtracting the velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). 

So plugging in the values. V1 is 0.6c, V2 is 0.5c. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for the relative speed. 

So the relative speed is 0.14c, that's part one. Now, the total energy of the system. Wait, each astronaut is a relativistic mass, right? So their energies would be their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, energy is gamma times mc². So the total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me calculate that. For v=0.6c, v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is gamma * 2m * c² → 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) → sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660. So gamma is approximately 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² → let's compute that. 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.4641. So 3.4641 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈ 5.9641 m c². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less. So the correct energy must be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says 'total energy of the system.' Do I have to consider anything else, like maybe the rest energy of the system as a whole? Or is it just the sum of the individual energies? I think for the total energy, it's the sum because each is moving, but their rest energy is included in their gamma factors. So yes, adding the two energies makes sense.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]
Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]
Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]
For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]
The total energy of the system is the sum of the two energies:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
