Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices like S (which is probably the Pauli matrices) are involved in representing spin operators. For a muon, which has spin 1/2, these matrices make sense because they're 2x2. 

The question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, let me write down the matrix for A_y. Since A_y = c·S, and S is the given matrix. Let's compute S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And c is h/(4π). So, A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

So A_y becomes:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                  [i, 0]]

Which is:

[[0, -(i h)/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), 0]]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. The matrix A_y is a Pauli matrix multiplied by a scalar, so I think its eigenvalues should be related to the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, the Pauli matrices (like S here) have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, S here is the 2x2 matrix given, which is the sigma_y Pauli matrix. Sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So then when multiplied by a scalar c, the eigenvalues become ±c.

So S has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y = c S would have eigenvalues ±c. So c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but let me check that. The Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -
