Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and start unpacking the question.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on one hemisphere. These spots affect the star's brightness as the star rotates, making it look like there's a planet causing the brightness variations. The question is asking: if instead of spots, we had a planet causing the same brightness dip, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

Hmm. So, the setup is that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause the observed brightness to dip periodically. This is similar to how a planet transiting a star blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. So, we need to compare the light variation caused by the spots to what a planet would cause.

Wait, but the star's light isn't just uniform. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light. When the star rotates and the spots come into view, the total brightness we see decreases. Similarly, a planet transiting would block some light, causing a dip. So, the problem is asking what planet radius would cause the same dip amplitude as the spots.

Let me think about the math involved. For a planet, the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet completely blocks that area. But for the spots, it's a bit more complex because the brightness change depends on the temperature difference and the area covered.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the spots. So, 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, one hemisphere is spotty. So, the total area of spots would be 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. The star's total surface area is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR². Therefore, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, when the star rotates, only a part of the spots is visible. Wait no, the entire hemisphere is covered. Wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So, when we look at the star, when the spotty side is facing us, we see all the spots. So, the area being blocked or emitting less is the entire spot area when the star is in that orientation.

Alternatively, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed from Earth (or wherever we're observing from), the spots come into view as the star rotates. So the maximum dip would occur when the spotty hemisphere is fully visible.

Wait, but the brightness change due to spots is not just the area blocked but the change in flux from that area. Because the spots are cooler, they emit less flux. So, the change in flux is (flux without spots) - (flux with spots). 

The flux from a star is proportional to the surface area times the temperature to the fourth power. So, the star's total flux without any
