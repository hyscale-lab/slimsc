Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says: the crystal is rhombohedral with interatomic distance 10 Angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, interatomic distance? In a crystal, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. But in a rhombohedral structure, it's not necessarily the same as the unit cell parameters. Hmm. Oh wait, no—rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal, but the angles can vary. So maybe the interatomic distance here refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in the rhombohedral system? Or is it something else?

Wait, I think the interatomic distance in a crystal is the distance between nearest neighbor atoms. In a simple cubic structure, that's just 'a', but in other structures, it might be different. But for a rhombohedral structure, which is like a cube but with all edges equal and angles possibly different, the interatomic distance would be 'a'—since all edges are same length. So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which would be the lattice parameter 'a'. So a = 10 Å.

Rhombohedral systems have the same a, b, c, but with angles alpha, beta, gamma. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral system with a = 10 Å and all angles 30 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The interplanar distance (d) is given by the formula from Bragg's law, which is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles...)).

Wait, right. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_hkl = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... some terms involving the angles...)) but I need to remember the exact expression.

I recall that for a cubic system (where a = b = c and all angles are 90 degrees), the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But in
