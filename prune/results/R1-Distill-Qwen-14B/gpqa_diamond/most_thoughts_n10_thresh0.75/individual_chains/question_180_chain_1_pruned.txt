Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the right answer is. Let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the setup: there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so maybe I can ignore gravitational effects and just focus on the electric interactions.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, the point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. I'm thinking that this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because the system is isolated, the potential energy is due to the arrangement of the charges.

Wait, but what's the minimum energy? I remember that in such systems, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that requires the least work to bring them together. Or wait, actually, maybe when the potential energy is the most negative? Hmm, because for opposite charges, bringing them together lowers the potential energy, but for same charges, it's higher. Wait, no, same charges repel, so their potential energy is higher, meaning the system is less stable.

Wait, no, the potential energy between two like charges is positive because the work done against their repulsion is positive. So when you place like charges close together, the potential energy is higher, i.e., more positive. So if the system is isolated, the minimum energy would be when the potential energy is as low as possible. But in this case, since all the charges are the same sign, maybe the minimum energy is when they are as far apart as possible. But wait, in this problem, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P. So the 13th is at P, and the others are fixed at radius 2m.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 13th is fixed at P, so it's at zero distance from itself.

So, the potential energy of the system would come from the interactions between the 13th charge
