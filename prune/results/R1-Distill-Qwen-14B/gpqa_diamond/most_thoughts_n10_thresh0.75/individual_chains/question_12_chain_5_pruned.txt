Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The given rest masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that the neutrino has a very small mass, almost negligible, so maybe we can consider it massless for this problem.

Hmm, right. So in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, the neutrino's mass is negligible, so maybe we can treat it as massless. That would mean the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is zero. The muon, on the other hand, has a significant rest mass, so its energy will be the sum of its kinetic energy and rest mass energy.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let me jot down what I know.

Energy conservation: The total energy before decay (which is just the rest energy of the pion) equals the total energy after decay (sum of energies of muon and neutrino).

Momentum conservation: The total momentum after decay must be zero because the pion was at rest. So the magnitudes of the momenta of muon and neutrino must be equal, but opposite in direction.

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu = 0 (approx.)

Let E_pi = m_pi * c², which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay:
E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )
E_nu = p_nu c (since m_nu is zero)

Since momentum is conserved, p_mu = p_nu (same magnitude, opposite direction). So I can write p_mu = p_nu = p.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c.

Setting this equal to E_pi:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can solve for p. Let me let x = p c for simplicity.

So the equation becomes:
sqrt( x² + m_mu² c^4 ) / c² + x/c = m_pi.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify the units. Let's make sure the units work out. Since E_pi is in MeV, and m_mu is in MeV/c², so when I multiply by c², I get MeV.

Wait, perhaps it's better to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. That simplifies things. So, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, and E_pi is also 139.6 MeV.

So, in c=1 units, the equation is:

sqrt( p² + m_mu² ) + p = m_pi.

Because E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) and E_nu = p.

So:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Let me rearrange this equation.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now, square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Let me calculate each square:

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16? Wait wait, wait. Let me compute it directly.

Wait, 139.6 * 139.6:

139 * 139 = (140-1)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 -280 +1= 19321.

0.6 * 139.6 * 2 = 0.6 * 279.2 = 167.52.

0.6^2 = 0.36.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 139.6^2 as (139 + 0.6)^2 = (139)^2 + 2*139*0.6 + (0.6)^2.

139^2 is 19321. 2*139*0.6 is 2*83.4 = 166.8. 0.6^2 is 0.36. So sum: 19321 + 166.8 = 19487.8 +0.36=19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: 105^2 is 11025, plus 2*105*0.7=147, plus 0.7^2=0.49. So 11025+147=11172, +0.49=11172.49.

So numerator is
