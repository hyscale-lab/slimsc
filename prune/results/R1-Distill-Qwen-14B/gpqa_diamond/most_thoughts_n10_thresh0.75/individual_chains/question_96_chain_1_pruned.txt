Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, each a power of 10.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to the area of its event horizon. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are the usual ones. Oh right, and S is measured in J/K because entropy has units of Boltzmann's constant (J/K).

So first, I need to find the area of the event horizon. To get the area, I need the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon radius R is related to the mass of the black hole via R = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, maybe I can find R directly using the angular size and the distance.

Angular size θ is given by θ = R / d, where R is the size of the object and d is the distance to it. But wait, isn't that the small angle approximation? So θ (in radians) is approximately R / d.

Given θ is in degrees, I should convert it to radians first. Oh right, because the formula uses radians. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180).

So let me compute θ_rad. θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees. Let's see, 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = π/(1.8e19) radians. Wait, let me compute that: 1e-17 * π/(180) is approximately (3.1416e-17) / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but wait: 1 degree is π/180 radians ≈ 0.01745 radians. So yeah, 1e-17 degrees is 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 1.
