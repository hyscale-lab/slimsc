Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, I remember that the molecular formula can help determine the possible functional groups. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So for C9H11NO2: n=9, m=11, x=2 (O), p=1 (N). 

So calculation: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 =3. So three degrees of unsaturation, which could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, but wait, wait. Benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. But wait, or is it three rings? No, each double bond or ring counts as one. Benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees. But wait, benzene itself is three double bonds. So the formula gives 3 degrees, which aligns with a benzene ring. So likely, the compound has a benzene ring.

Now looking at the spectral data. Let's start with the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad stretches, maybe N-H stretches. Wait, but wait. If it's a primary amine, the NH would be broad, around 3300-3500. Alternatively, an amide has N-H stretching. But looking at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, or maybe an acid. But 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carbonyl. Wait, esters usually have around 1730-1750. Amides are lower, like 1650-1680. Hmm, so 1720 could be an ester, maybe. Or perhaps a ketone? But the other data might help more.

Let's look at the 1H NMR. The peaks are:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H): This looks like a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, which would be the case if it's connected to a CH2 group. So ethyl group maybe attached to O or N.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): Broad singlet, maybe an NH2 group? Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad and split into multiple peaks. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group, but OCH2 is usually a triplet if next to a CH2CH3. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom.
