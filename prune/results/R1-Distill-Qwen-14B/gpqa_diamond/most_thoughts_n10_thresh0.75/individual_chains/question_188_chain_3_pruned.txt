Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles the same, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. So the unit cell edge length is a = 10 Angstroms here.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance, which is the d-spacing for the (111) plane. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )^(1/2) )?

Wait, no, I think the general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) )? Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, for a cubic crystal, when alpha, beta, gamma are all 90 degrees, the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here it's not cubic, it's rhombohedral, so the formula is more complicated.

Wait, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, since all edges are equal and all angles are equal, the formula for d-spacing might have a simplified form. Let me think. The general formula for d is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² + 2( hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha ) } }

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Oh, right, I think the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but wait, another thing: in a rhombohedral system, since alpha = beta = gamma, so cos alpha = cos beta = cos gamma = cos 30 degrees. Cos 30 is sqrt(
