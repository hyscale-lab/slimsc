Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about calculating the probability of measuring a certain value of an observable in a quantum system. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when dealing with observables and states, we use the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, I think in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a vector in a Hilbert space, and it's often represented as a column vector. Oh right, but the state should be normalized, right? Because probabilities have to add up to 1. Wait, let me check. The given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Oh, but maybe the observable P is given, and I'm supposed to compute the expectation value or the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue. 

Wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring the observable P. So I think I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector. The square of the magnitude of that projection gives the probability.

Alternatively, I remember that the expectation value is the sum over the probabilities multiplying their eigenvalues, but here I just need the probability for a specific eigenvalue,
