Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential because it follows Hooke's law. 

The question asks for two things: the value of the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, which I need to look at after I think through the problem.

Wait, I remember that in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along each axis. So the energy levels would be the sum of the energies in each direction. Each one-dimensional oscillator has energy levels given by (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

So for three dimensions, the total energy E would be (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, the principal quantum number for 3D is often written as N = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (N + 3/2) ħω. That makes sense because each direction contributes n_i + 1/2.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state and how are excited states counted? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is N=0. The first excited state would be N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So the third excited state would correspond to N=3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The ground state is the lowest, so the first excited state is the next one. So ground state is N=0 (since 0 is the lowest possible), first excited is N=1, second is N=2, third excited is N=3. So yes, third excited state is N=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Okay, so looking at the options, options A and C have this energy value.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to this energy level? That's about the degeneracy of the state, right? The degeneracy is the number of different states (eigenfunctions) that have the same energy.

For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for energy level N is (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 when considering all possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations that sum to N. Wait, another way: the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z, where each n can be 0 or higher. So for N=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) sum to 3?

The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N is (N + 2) choose 2, which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for N=3, it's (
