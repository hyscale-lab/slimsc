Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different possible decay products.

Hmm, right. Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, the decay products must have a combined mass that's less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into others, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the particle. Also, since X is a boson, I think it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because bosons can carry integer spin and fermions have half-integer spin, but when they are in a pair, the total spin can be integer. So the decay products would probably be a fermion and its antiparticle.

Wait, the Lagrangian term: L = -λf ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. Oh, right, that looks like an interaction term where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f bar. But wait, ψ_f is a fermion, so X can decay into two fermions, but since fermions have mass, we need the sum of the masses of the fermions to be less than or equal to X's mass.

So the possible fermions ψ_f that X can decay into would be any that have a mass less than 3 GeV each, or less than 6 GeV in total. Wait, wait, because each fermion would have a mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So m ≤ 3 GeV.

But wait, the fermions in the decay products would each have energy, not just their rest mass. But for the threshold of decay, the rest mass is the limiting factor. So the rest mass of each fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the known fermions with masses less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The top quark is the heaviest, with a mass around 173 GeV, way above. So no, top quarks are out.

The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. Hmm, but wait, 4.5 is more than 3. So if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into a b quark pair? Because 2*4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that's not possible. So b quarks are out.

What about the charm quark? Its mass is around 1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5 = 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Then there's the strange quark. The strange quark's mass is about 100 MeV (I think around 95-105 MeV, depending on the source), which is way less than 3 GeV. So s s-bar is allowed.

The up quark is even lighter, around 2-4 MeV, so u u-bar is allowed.

The down quark is also light, about 4-5 MeV, so d d-bar is allowed.

Then, what about leptons? The tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 ≈ 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pairs are allowed.

The muon is about 0.105 GeV, so mu+ mu- is allowed.
