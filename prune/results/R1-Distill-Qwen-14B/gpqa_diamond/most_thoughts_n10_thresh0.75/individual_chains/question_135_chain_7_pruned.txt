Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and asks about the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to choose between four options.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that might be a typo or maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, maybe it's L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (X(y)) ψ_f(y), because the ν might not make sense here. Or perhaps it's a typo and should be X(y) without the ν? Because if ν is a constant, then it's a shift in X, but maybe we can ignore that for the purposes of decay. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f. So the interaction term is something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the vertex would be X coupling to two fermions, right? So when X decays, it can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that is kinematically allowed. But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a fermion pair, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but for decay into a pair of particles, the condition is that twice the mass of the fermion (since each would have mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X). Because each fermion in the pair would have energy E ≥ m, and for decay, the minimum energy is when they are at rest, so each would have mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X.

So let me list the possible fermion pairs and their masses.

Fermions and their masses (roughly):

- e-: 0.511 MeV (negligible)
- mu-: ~105.7 MeV
- tau-: ~1.78 GeV
- u: ~2
