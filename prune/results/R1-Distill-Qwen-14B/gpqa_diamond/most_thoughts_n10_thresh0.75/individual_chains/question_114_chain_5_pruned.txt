Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which reagents go with which reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone, right? So the structure is (CH3)2CO) and sodium cyanide (NaCN), with reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, that product's structureâ€”let me imagine it. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO, so reacting it with CN-... Oh, I think this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. In ketones, the carbonyl group can undergo nucleophilic attack. So NaCN would provide the cyanide ion as the nucleophile.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it typically forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets a proton. So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. The starting ketone is butan-2-one: four carbons with the ketone in the middle. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons, but the product's structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO (which is 3 carbons including the ketone), and the product adds a CN group. So adding CN to the carbonyl would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That would be 3 carbons from the ketone plus the cyanide? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, butan-2-one is actually (CH3)2CO. So four carbons in total: CH3-C(=O)-CH2? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, but that can't be right because butan-2-one would be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3? Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: butan-2-one is methyl isopropyl ketone. Structure is CH(CH3)2CO. Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CH-CO? No, wait, butan-2-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, but that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no. Let me
