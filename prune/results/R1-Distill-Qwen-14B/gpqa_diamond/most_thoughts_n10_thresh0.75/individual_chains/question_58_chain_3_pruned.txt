Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to deal with these infinities, then taking the limit where the cutoff goes away.

So I need to figure out which theory doesn't need this regularization, meaning it's finite or doesn't produce these divergences. Let's think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations stuff, right? But wait, classical theories don't really deal with quantum divergences because they don't involve quantum mechanics. So when you quantize them, like in QED, you get issues that require regularization. But in their classical form, do they have divergences? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, in classical electromagnetism, things like point charges have issues with infinite potentials and self-energy, but I think those are more about mathematical representations rather than physical divergences that require regularization in the quantum sense. But wait, the question is about when you go to high energies. Maybe in classical theory, you don't need regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Oh, but the question is about the theories themselves. So if a theory is classical, like option D, perhaps it doesn't require regularization because regularization is a quantum field theory tool.

Let me think about the other options. B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). I know that QCD is a quantum field theory dealing with the strong force. But I remember that at high energies, QCD becomes asymptotically free, which means the coupling constant decreases, making perturbative calculations manageable. However, does it require regularization? Well, any quantum field theory with loops probably has divergences, so they must use regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So QCD would require regularization. So B is out.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a well-established quantum field theory. I know that when you calculate loop diagrams in QED, you get divergent integrals. For example, the
