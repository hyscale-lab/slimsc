Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. But wait, which theories actually need this?

Let me think about each option. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I've heard that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a theory that's renormalized. Renormalization is a process where you deal with these infinities by absorbing them into physical constants, right? But does that mean regularization is needed? I think regularization is part of the renormalization process. So QED requires regularization because it has loop divergences. So option C is out.

What about Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)? QCD deals with the strong force, and I remember that at high energies, quarks behave almost like free particles because of asymptotic freedom. But does QCD require regularization? I think QCD calculations also have divergences, so yes, regularization is needed. So option B is not the answer.

Now, Superstring Theoryâ€”I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Superstring Theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as in QFT. Wait, because in string theory, particles are not point-like
