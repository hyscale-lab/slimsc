Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probability. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

So the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits. Also, their host stars have the same radius, but the star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit depends on the orbital inclination and the relative sizes. The formula I remember is something like P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's more about the planet's orbital size relative to the star's size. Oh right, the probability is roughly (R_star / a)², but wait no, I think it's actually (R_star / a) multiplied by the chance of the orbit being edge-on enough. Or is it more accurate to say that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but since both orbits are circular, that term becomes 1. So it's just R_star / a.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Because the planet has to be close enough in the plane of the sky for its path to cross our line of sight to the star. So a smaller a (closer in) would mean a higher probability because R_*/a is bigger.

Wait, but wait. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) * P^2)/(4π²). But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 is proportional to M_* * P^2. So a is proportional to (M_* * P^2)^(1/3).

Given that, Planet_1 has a period P1 = P2 /3. And M1 = 2*M2. So for Planet_1, a1 is proportional to (2*M2 * (P2/3)^2)^(1/3) = (2 * (P2^2) * M2) / 3^2)^(1/3).

Wait, let me compute that properly. Let me denote M2 as the mass of Planet_2's star, so M1 = 2*M2. Then for Planet_1, a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1^2)^(1/3) = (2*M2 * (P2/3)^2)^(1/3) = (2 * M2 * P2² / 9)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3).

For Planet_2, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3). So the ratio a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3). Let me calculate that.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606. So a1 is roughly 0.606 times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period, so it's closer in to its star.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a). Both stars have the same radius, R. So the probability for Planet_1, P1_prob, is R/(a1), and for Planet_2, P2_prob is R/(a2). Since a1 is smaller than a2, R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So P1_prob is higher than P2_prob.

Let me calculate the actual ratio. P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) )= a2/a1. Since a1 = 0.606 a2, the ratio is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.649. So Planet_1's probability is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. Wait, wait no. Because the probability is (R/a). So P1's (R/a1) is R/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R/a2). So P1_prob is (1.649) times P2_prob. So Planet_1 is more probable by about 1.65 times.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability. Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D is 2.7 times, which is higher than what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the math. The ratio a1/a2 is ( (2 M2) * (P1^2) )^(1/3) / ( M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3) ). Since P1 = P2 /3, P1^2 = (P2^2)/9. So substituting, M2 cancels out.

So a1/a2 = [ (2) * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606. So a1 is 0.606 a2. Therefore, R/a1 is (1/0.606) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.649 * (R/a2). So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by about 1.65 times. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer should be option C. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up a1 and a2. Because I might have messed up which is which.

Wait, a1 is the semi-major axis of Planet_1, and a2 is that of Planet_2. So a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is larger than R/a2, so Planet_1 has a higher probability.

So the options are:

A) Planet_2, 2.25x higher.

B) Planet_2, 1.5x.

C) Planet_1, 1.65x.

D) Planet_1, 2.7x.

So the correct option is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital semi-major axis of the planet. Since both stars have the same radius, the probability depends on the ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axis for each planet:

1. **Planet_1**: The host star's mass is \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), and the orbital period is \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \). Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   a_1 \propto (M_1 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3} = \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}.
   \]

2. **Planet_2**: The host star's mass is \( M_2 \), and the orbital period is \( P_2 \). Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}.
   \]

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller orbital distance than Planet_2.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given the options, the correct choice is that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting.
