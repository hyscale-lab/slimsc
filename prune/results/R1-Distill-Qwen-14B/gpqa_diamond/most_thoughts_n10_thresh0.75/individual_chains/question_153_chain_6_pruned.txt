Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me see...

The question gives three separate reactions (A, B, C) and I need to find the major products for each. Then, choose the correct set of products from the options A to D. 

First, let me recap what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This reaction typically involves enolates as the nucleophile. Oh wait, the question says that when the nucleophile is an enolate and it attacks the beta-carbon, that's the Michael reaction. So in each case, the enolate acts as a nucleophile towards an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with Reaction A:

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ Product A.

Hmm. So the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The conditions are sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate.

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? It's CH2(CO2Me)2. The structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2, which is another O=C-OCH3. So the malonate is a good nucleophile because when deprotonated, the enolate can attack.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure: CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the substituent is at the gamma position? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me sketch it.

Acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then COOR is on C3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have a p-tolyl group on the C3. Wait, but that's the same as the COOR group. That can't be right. Maybe it's on C2? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl
