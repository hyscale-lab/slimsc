Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus is on two parts: part A and part B. 

Part A is about identifying which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism refers to the ability of a compound to shift a hydrogen and adjacent atom between two positions, resulting in different isomers, like in ketones and aldehydes. So, I need to figure out which of these two compounds can't undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, I think, is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but it has two ketone groups. For tautomerism to occur, the molecule must have adjacent hydrogen and an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, but each ketone in benzoquinone is attached to a benzene ring. So, maybe the structure is such that the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the ring. Would that allow for tautomerism? Hmm, tautomerism in quinones... Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4-C=O. So, if there are hydrogens adjacent to the oxygen in the ring, maybe they can shift. Like, the structure could perhaps undergo some kind of keto-enol tautomerism? Or maybe not because the ring is aromatic and the position of the hydrogens might not allow it. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the positions are such that the hydrogen isn't in a position to shift.

Then, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So, I think that's a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at every other carbon. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Well, each ketone has adjacent carbons. For tautomerism, you usually have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone
