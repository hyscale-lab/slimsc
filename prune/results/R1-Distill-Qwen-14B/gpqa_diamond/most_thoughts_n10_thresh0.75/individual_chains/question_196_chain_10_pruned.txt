Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, okay. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I have to consider special relativity effects. 

The problem states that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options involve expressions with c, the speed of light, so relativity is definitely in play here.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formula directly.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But the oscillator's energy is quantized, but since the question doesn't specify quantum mechanics, I can think classically.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, and at maximum speed, the potential energy is zero because x=0 (but wait, that's not right—when x is maximum, potential is maximum, kinetic is zero. Wait, no, the maximum speed is when it passes through equilibrium, x=0, so potential is zero and kinetic is maximum.

Ah, right. So, the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=0, E = K, which is (gamma -1) mc², because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². At maximum displacement x=A, all energy is potential, so E = (1/2)kA². 

Wait, but in relativity, the potential energy due to the spring might be treated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + (gamma mc² - mc²) because at x=A, the KE is just the rest energy plus potential. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the system using relativistic mechanics equations. The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated than the classical case. The force is F = -kx, but relativistic dynamics involve momentum p = gamma mv. So F = dp/dt.

So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m d/dt (gamma v). Since F = -k x, and x can be expressed in terms of v and gamma, maybe integrating this would give the energy.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about energy conservation. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator should be conserved. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1) mc². At maximum displacement
