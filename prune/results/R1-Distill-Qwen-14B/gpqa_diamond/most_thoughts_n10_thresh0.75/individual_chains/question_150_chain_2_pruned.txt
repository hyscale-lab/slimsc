Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. The NMR data is provided, so I'll need to analyze that first to determine the structure. Then, I have to consider the reaction steps with the given reagents: NaNO2 + HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The question is about identifying the final product from the options given.

Let me start by looking at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I'll try to break these down.

The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, integrating to 1H. That sounds like an aldehyde proton (RCHO), which usually appears around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and split into a doublet if adjacent to a CH2 group? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substitution. Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe. The doublets with two protons each suggest a substituent in the para position. So perhaps there are two phenyl groups attached? Or maybe it's a substituted benzene ring.

Wait, then there's a peak at 6.27 (bs, 2H). The broad singlet suggests maybe some protons that are deshielded and perhaps part of an enol or something with hydrogen bonding. Or maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Like an -OH group nearby? Or perhaps it's a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom. Maybe OCH2 or something similar. So, maybe an ether link or an oxygen adjacent.

Putting this together, the structure might have an aldehyde group, some oxygen-containing groups, and a couple of aromatic rings.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C8H9NO: Each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 -m -x - y)/2. So n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). 

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18 -11)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have half a degree. Did
