Okay, let's tackle this question about SARS-CoV-2's molecular biology. So the question is asking which statement is incorrect. All options are statements about various aspects of the virus's biology, and I need to find the one that's wrong.

First, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: It says that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN works as heterodimers in mismatch repair, and that the N-terminal ExoN of nsp14 binds nsp10 to make an active exonuclease complex. Wait, I remember that nsp14 has an ExoN domain, right? But I think that nsp10 binds to nsp14's N-terminal region, which includes the ExoN. Together, they form an exonuclease active in proofreading. Wait, but mismatch repair is a process where the cell corrects errors during DNA replication, but wait, viruses don't have that. Oh, wait, maybe the question is about RNA replication. Oh right, because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus. So their replication machinery includes an exonuclease for error correction. So nsp10 and nsp14 form a complex that exoNuclease activity, which is involved in RNA replication. So I think this statement in option A is correct. But wait, the statement says the complex prevents breakdown of dsRNA? Hmm, don't know. Maybe in the replication process, the exonuclease activity helps
