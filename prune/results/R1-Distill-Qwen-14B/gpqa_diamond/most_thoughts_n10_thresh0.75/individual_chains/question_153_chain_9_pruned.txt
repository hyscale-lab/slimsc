Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition, where a nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. But wait, sometimes it's called a conjugate addition. Right, the nucleophile adds to the β position, creating a new bond and forming an enolate intermediate.

So the question has three parts, A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, and we need to determine the products based on the reactants given.

Let's look at part A first. The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. I think its structure is (CH3)2C(CO2Me)2. Wait, no, wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2, right? That's the enolate part. So when it reacts, the enolate part attacks the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-CO2Me, but wait, the substituent is p-tolyl. So wait: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me, but the p-tolyl group is at the 3 position. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group at position 3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the ester is at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group where? Oh wait, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl. Wait, no, the acrylate is CH2=CH-COOCH3. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-COOCH2-p-tolyl? Not sure. Maybe I should think of it as the α,β-
