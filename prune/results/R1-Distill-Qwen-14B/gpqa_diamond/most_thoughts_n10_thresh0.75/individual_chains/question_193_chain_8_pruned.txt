Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about how the number of stars varies with distance, given that it varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So d = 1 / plx. So when plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But I need to find how N varies with distance. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that into the equation.

Let me write that down. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Hmm, that simplifies. 1/(1/d^5) is equal to d^5. Wait, no—wait, (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1 divided by that is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, they're asking about the differential: how much does N change as you go from d to d + dr. So it's about the derivative of N with respect
