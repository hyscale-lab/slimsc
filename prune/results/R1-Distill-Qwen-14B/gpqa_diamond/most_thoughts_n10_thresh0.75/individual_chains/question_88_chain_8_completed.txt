Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think it through.

So the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability.

Wait, what are Peyer's patches? Oh right, they're specialized areas of the small intestine's mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. They're important for immune responses, especially against pathogens that enter through the gut. So if the GFP-labeled proteins ended up in Peyer's patches, that suggests they were taken up by the immune system there.

The next part is about the cells isolated from the Peyer's patches. These cells are proliferating, so I think they're lymphocytes, probably B cells or T cells. The variable heavy chain gene sequencing showing high variabilityâ€”variable regions in antibodies are where the diversity comes from.

But wait, the question is about the process happening. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me recall each process:

VDJ recombination is during the generation of the initial diversity in B cells. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to create the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow.

Somatic hypermutation occurs later, after the B cell has been activated. It's a process where the variable regions are slightly mutated, increasing the diversity of the antibody. This happens in the germinal centers during the immune response, leading to affinity maturation.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which is also a process that happens after activation. It's directed by cytokines and involves recombination of the heavy chain's constant region.

Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, leading to their lysis or marking them for phagocytosis. Not directly related to the variability of the gene here.

So the question says the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. When would that happen? VDJ recombination is during the initial stages when B cells are created, but if they're already in the Peyer's patches and have proliferated, perhaps they're undergoing further diversification.

Wait, Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, so when these GFP-tagged proteins are delivered, the immune system would take them up. The B cells in the Peyer's patches would encounter the antigen (the GFP-tagged proteins) and activate. Once activated, they go through the germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation.

But the question is about the process taking place when they're isolated and sequenced. The high variability suggests that each cell's variable region is different. So if the B cells are in the germinal center, they're undergoing hypermutation, which increases variability. Alternatively, if the process was VDJ, that's already happened earlier when the B cells were formed in the bone marrow.

So the process observed here is somatic hypermutation because that's when the variable regions are being diversified after antigen exposure. So the answer would be A) somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but another thought: the variable heavy chain gene is being sequenced. Somatic hypermutation affects the variable regions of the B cell receptor, so the high variability would be a result of that. So yes, the process is A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging reveals that some GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer's patches, where they are taken up by the immune system. Isolating the proliferating cell population from the Peyer's patches and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes shows high variability. This suggests a process that diversifies the variable regions of the heavy chain after antigen exposure.

To evaluate the options:

- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to create the initial diversity of the variable region. However, this process happens before the B cells encounter an antigen and is unlikely to explain the observed variability in this experiment.

- **Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs after B cell activation, specifically in germinal centers, where the variable regions of the heavy chain are slightly mutated to increase antibody diversity. This aligns with the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.

- **Class switching recombination** involves changing the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and affects the constant region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This is not relevant to the observed variability.

- **Complement activation** is a process that targets pathogens for destruction and is unrelated to the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Given that the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is observed after antigen exposure and in the context of Peyer's patches, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**.
