Okay, so I have this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on black hole thermodynamics, but let me think. The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance, and I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude.

Wait, the event horizon's angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the size of the object. Oh right, the formula θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance, when θ is very small. So θ ≈ size / d.

But wait, θ is given in degrees. I'll need to convert that to radians first because the formula uses radians. How do I convert degrees to radians? Oh, right, multiply by π/180. So θ_radians = θ_degrees * π/180.

So θ_degrees is 1e-17. Let me compute θ_radians: 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me approximate that. π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the size (diameter) of the event horizon would be approximately θ_rad * d. Wait, but wait, no. The formula is θ ≈ size / d, so size ≈ θ_rad * d.

Wait, but the size here is the diameter of the event horizon. The event horizon radius is R = 2GM/c². But maybe for this problem, I don't need to get into that. I just need the size to find the radius, then use the entropy formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The event horizon's angular size is θ, so using θ ≈ (diameter) / d. So diameter D = θ_rad * d. So radius R = D/2 = θ_rad * d / 2.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the
