Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. 

First, let's read the problem again. The black hole is at a distance d of 10^10 parsecs, and its event horizon has an angular size θ of 10^-17 degrees. We need to find the entropy, which I remember is related to the area of the event horizon. 

Wait, right! The entropy of a black hole is given by the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I think another way to write it is S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So yeah, that's the formula I need to use.

But to find A, the area, I probably need to find the radius of the event horizon first. The event horizon's radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula, R = 2 G M / c², where M is the mass of the black hole. So if I can find M, I can compute R and then A.

Wait, but I don't have M directly. Instead, I have the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh right, the angular size relates to the actual size of the object. The formula for angular size is θ = (R) / (d), where θ is in radians. But wait, θ is given in degrees. So I'll need to convert it to radians first.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Use θ ≈ R/d to find R because for small angles, the approximation holds (since θ is super tiny, 1e-17 degrees).
3. From R, find M using R = 2 G M / c².
4. Once I have M, calculate the area A = 4 π R².
5. Plug A into the entropy formula to find S.
6. Finally, find the order of magnitude of S.

Let's go through each step.

Step 1: Convert θ from degrees to radians. The conversion factor is π radians per 180 degrees. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). 

Given θ = 1e-17 degrees, θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. 1e-17 * 3.1416 / 180. Hmm, 3.1416/180 is approximately 0.0174533. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. 

Step 2: θ ≈ R/d => R = θ * d. Wait, but d is in parsecs, and I need to convert it into meters because the other constants (like G, c) are in SI units.

I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m. Let's compute that: 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m. Let's compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. Let me calculate 1.745 * 3.086. 

1.745 * 3 is about 5.235, and 0.086 * 1.745 is about 0.15, so total around 5.385. So R ≈ 5.385e7 meters. Wait, let me double-check that math. 

Wait, 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 *3.086) * (1e-19 *1e26). The exponents: 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7. So 1.745 *3.086 is approximately 5.383. So R ≈ 5.383e7 meters. That's 5.383e7 meters, which is about 5.38e7 m.

Wait, that seems a bit large for a supermassive black hole. Wait, no, supermassive black holes can have masses up to millions or billions of solar masses. Let me think: the Schwarzschild radius R is about 3 km per solar mass. So for a million solar masses, R would be about 3e6 km, which is 3e9 meters. Wait, wait, I got R as ~5e7 meters, which is 5e4 km. That's about 50,000 km. Hmm, that's a bit small, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate R:

θ_rad is 1e-17 degrees converted to radians. So 1e-17 * (π/180) =
