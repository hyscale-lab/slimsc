Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through what I know.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. Right, the formula is something like the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) equals the exponential of ( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So, let's define the excited state as level E2 and the lower state as E1. But wait, no, the question says the energy difference is between the two levels. So the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J.

Star_1 has iron atoms twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So let's say, for star_1, the population in E2 is n2, and in E1 it's n1. The ratio n2/n1 would be proportional to the excitation. Since star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2, maybe I should set up the ratios for both stars.

Wait, no, actually, the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or is it the excitation potential? Hmm, I think it's the ratio of populations. Let me clarify: star_1's n2 is twice star_2's n2. Or wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, the number of excited atoms is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So for a given level, say E2, the population n2 in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n2_1 = 2 * n2_2.

But using the Boltzmann equation, the ratio n2/n1 (for each star) depends on their respective temperatures. So for each star, the ratio of the populations of E2 to E1 is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the two stars' ratios would be (n2_1 / n1_1) = (n2_2 / n1_2) multiplied by something. Hmm, maybe I should write the expression for each star.

Let me denote:

For star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (
