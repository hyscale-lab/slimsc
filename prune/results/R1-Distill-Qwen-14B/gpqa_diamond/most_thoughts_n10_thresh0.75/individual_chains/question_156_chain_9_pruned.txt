Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because epoxidation and HPLC chromatography can get a bit tricky. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, both using mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, so it's used for epoxidation of alkenes. The starting alkenes are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

First, I need to figure out what happens in each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. Epoxidation adds an epoxide group across the double bond. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it's a concerted process. The E geometry will influence the resulting epoxide's stereochemistry.

Wait, but when you epoxidize an alkene, you form an epoxide with two new stereocenters. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) affects the configuration of the epoxide. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans double bond, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide? Or wait, no. Let me think. The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the original geometry is preserved in the ring. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on each carbon are opposite, so in the epoxide, the two new oxygen atoms would be on opposite sides. So the epoxide would be a trans-diepoxide? Or perhaps the configuration depends on the starting double bond.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me recall. Epoxidation of a trans (E) alkene would lead to a trans epoxide. Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Because when the peracid adds across the double bond, the two new oxygen atoms are added in a cis fashion. Let me visualize (E)-oct-4-ene: the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. So, when epoxidized, the two new oxygen atoms (from mCPBA) would be on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide? Or wait, perhaps the opposite. Let me think again.

Wait, the epoxidation reaction adds an oxygen across the double bond. The peracid (mCPBA) reacts with the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. So for a trans (E) double bond, the substituents on each carbon are opposite. So, when the epoxide forms, the two new stereocenters will have the same stereochemistry as the double bond. Because in the epoxidation, the peracid adds across the same face of the double bond, leading the two new chiral centers to have the same configuration as the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, no, perhaps the opposite. Let's think about the transition state. The peracid adds an oxygen across the double bond. If the starting alkene is E
