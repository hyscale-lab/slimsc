Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I'm definitely going to have to use Einstein's equations, not Newtonian mechanics.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction? Oh, right, so when finding the relative speed, I need to calculate how fast one is moving relative to the other.

First, I think I should tackle the relative speed. Oh wait, when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities as you would in Newtonian physics. I remember that you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So the relative speed here would be the difference in their speeds divided by 1 minus (product of speeds divided by c squared). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, let's say the first astronaut's speed is u = 0.6c and the second is v = 0.5c. So the relative speed of the second as seen from the first's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c, which looks like one of the options, specifically options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem asks for the relative speed. But which direction? If I'm calculating the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen by the first, it would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, that depends on which frame we're considering. Oh wait, for relative velocity, if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v, both in the same direction, then the speed of B relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²))? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The formula is (u' = (v
