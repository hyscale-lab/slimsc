Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, okay, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. I remember that the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 parsecs is twice as far.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed implies that there's the same number of stars in each unit volume, right? Wait, but I think that in this context, maybe it's uniform in terms of space density, meaning the number density is constant. So if you consider a certain volume, the number of stars in it doesn't depend on where you are in space.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars fall into a small change in parallax, say dplx. I'm thinking about the relation between parallax and distance, and how that affects the number of stars.

Parallax plx is related to distance d by d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases, meaning the stars are closer. But wait, let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of such a shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Since the number density of stars is uniform, let's call it n (number per unit volume), the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But we want to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But wait, I think we need to change variables from dr to dplx. Let's find dr in terms of dplx.

We have d = 1/plx, so taking the derivative, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering small ranges, maybe we can ignore the negative sign, or take the absolute value. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting back into the number of stars: n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx. That comes to n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Hmm, wait, but that would mean the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. But that seems a bit high. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting dr. Let's take it step by step. We have dr = (d/dplx)(1/plx) ) dplx. The derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx is -1/(plx^2). So dr = -1/(plx^2) dplx. But since plx is positive, and we're considering positive increments, maybe I should take the absolute value. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. So that's n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. Wait, but that would make the number of stars per unit plx decrease rapidly as plx increases.

But that seems off because at lower parallax (farther stars), the number of stars per unit plx should be lower, but if it's 1/plx^4, that's a steep drop. Alternatively, perhaps I got something wrong in the setup.

Wait another approach: the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = number density * volume between those parallaxes.

Wait, the volume between two distances d and d + dr is 4πd² dr. But if I'm considering a small change in parallax, I need to express the volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit plx is the number density multiplied by the surface area (4πd²) times the change in d, which is dr.

But we have to change variables from d to plx. So d =1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. So 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in that range is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So N = (n *4π) * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Therefore, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number of stars in a volume increases with distance, but in terms of parallax, higher plx is closer. So more stars are closer, so perhaps the number per unit plx is higher at lower plx (since more stars are nearby and thus have higher parallax). But according to the math, the number per unit plx should be 1/plx^4, which means as plx increases (closer stars), the number per unit plx goes up, but only for a moment. Because if plx doubles, 1/plx^4 becomes 1/16 of the original. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula suggests that for a given dplx, the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^4. So for a small range dplx, as plx increases, the number of stars in that range decreases rapidly. But wait, wait, we're looking at the number of stars per unit plx. So for a fixed dplx, say 0.1 parsecs, the number of stars in that range would be higher for lower plx (since more stars are closer). Because as plx increases, the distance decreases, and the number of stars should be higher in the closer regions.

Wait, but according to the formula, when plx is small (so d is large), the number per unit plx is (1/plx^4) * dplx, so for small plx, it's a larger number. So that makes sense: more stars nearby, so for a given change in plx (like 0.1), there are more stars when plx is 0.1 than when plx is 1.0.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for a given dplx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the number per unit volume is constant, so the number per unit volume is n. The number of stars in a volume V is nV. So the number of stars in a shell with thickness dr is n * 4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 (1/plx²) dplx = n*4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is (n*4π) / plx^4, which is 1/plx^4. So that's option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way to think about it: the number of stars in a small range of plx (dplx) would involve the surface area at that distance (4πd²) times the thickness in distance (dr). But since dr is related to dplx, as I did before, it comes out to the same thing.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of probability distribution. The probability density function for plx would be proportional to the number of stars per unit plx. We know that the number of stars in a shell is proportional to 1/(d^2) * dr, but d is 1/plx, so dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises because the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume, which depends on d squared times dr, and that's where the 1/plx^4 comes from.

So, according to the calculation, the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. If the number density is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume is n times the volume. The volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume between 1/plx and 1/(plx+dplx). But that's not a simple shell. Maybe I should compute the volume between plx and plx + dplx in terms of distance.

Wait, no, that's more complicated. Because the volume at a particular distance d is a shell from d to d+dr, which is a spherical shell with volume 4πd² dr. But when you express this in terms of plx, it's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So that gives 4π/(plx^4) dplx. So the number of stars is n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is n *4π / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx to the fourth power.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the relationship between parallax and distance. The parallax \( \text{plx} \) is related to distance \( d \) by \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). Since the number density of stars \( n \) is uniform, the number of stars in this shell is proportional to \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr \).

To express this in terms of parallax, we substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Taking the derivative \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), and ignoring the negative sign (as we are considering small positive increments), we find \( dr = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the expression for the number of stars in the shell, we get:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This means that as parallax increases (closer stars), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases rapidly.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
