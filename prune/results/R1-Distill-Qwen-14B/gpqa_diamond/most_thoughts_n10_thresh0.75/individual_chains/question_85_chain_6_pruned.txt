Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. Alright, the question says there are two planets detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Each planet has its own mass and radius. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. 

Oh wait, the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula, I think, is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ), where 'a' is the orbital distance. But wait, maybe it's more accurate to say it's T_star multiplied by the square root of (R_star / (2a)) or something like that. Or maybe the inverse square law plays a role here. Let me thinkâ€”equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

Wait, the formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ... wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the equation:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )
