Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with conductors and charges, the method of images might come into play. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I'm supposed to find the potential energy of this system. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I recall that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble those charges. In this case, the system consists of the charge q and the induced charges on the conducting sphere.

Since the sphere is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which means it's at zero potential. But wait, because it's a conductor, charges will redistribute on its surface. So when a charge q is placed outside the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. I remember that the conducting sphere will have an induced charge of -q, but wait, no, that's when the sphere is isolated. Oh wait, no, in this case, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges would actually flow into the ground. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, no. The sphere is conducting and grounded, so any induced charges on it can't build up because they can escape to the ground. So when a positive charge q is placed near the sphere, the nearby electrons in the sphere will be attracted towards the charge q. Since the sphere is connected to the ground, electrons can flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with a net positive charge. Or wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the charge outside is positive, it induces negative charges on the sphere's near side and positive on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced positive charges would push electrons into the ground, so the sphere itself would have no net charge. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the sphere is neutral to start with. When you bring a charge near, the induced charges would cause a redistribution. But because the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can be conducted away.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. For a conducting sphere that's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the presence of an external charge induces surface charges on the sphere, but because the sphere is at zero potential
