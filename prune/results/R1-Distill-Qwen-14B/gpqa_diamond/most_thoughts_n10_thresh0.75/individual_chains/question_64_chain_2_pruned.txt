Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these types of problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They were heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they give off a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 g, forming CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what's happening in each of these steps. Let's start by understanding each tube's function.

Tube 1 is filled with Mg(ClO4)2, which I think is a drying agent. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a deliquescent, meaning it absorbs water. So when a gas passes through it, any moisture (like water vapor) in the gas would be absorbed here. So the weight increase of tube 1 is due to the water vapor from the gases.

Wait, but in the question, the gases were passed through tube 1, and the tube increased by 3.60 g. So that suggests that the gas mixture contained water vapor. So the weight gain is the mass of water absorbed. So 3.60 grams of H2O?

So from that, maybe the initial gases contained H2O which got trapped here. So that's 3.60 g of H2O.

Then, the gases go to tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Wait, Ca(OH)2 solution is typically used to absorb CO2. If the gas mixture had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since there's no change in weight, that suggests no CO2 was present. Alternatively, maybe the solution was saturated or something, but I think in this case, the lack of change suggests that the gas doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. So the gas isn't CO2. Or perhaps, any CO2 was already removed by tube 1? No, because tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is for water. So maybe the gas doesn't have CO2.

Then, the gas enters tube 3, which has red-hot copper. The copper gains 0.80 g, forming CuO. So what reacts with copper? Well, sulfur dioxide (SO2) can be oxidized by copper when heated. I think the reaction is SO2 + 2 Cu → Cu2S + 2 SO2? Wait, no, maybe it's when SO2 is passed over hot Cu, it gets oxidized. Or alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas.

Wait, I think when SO2 is passed over hot Cu, it can be oxidized to SO3. Or perhaps it's more about moisture again. Wait, but in tube 3, the copper is red-hot, so maybe it's reacting with a gas that can oxidize it. Another possibility is that the gas is H2S, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2. But how? Because if the salts decompose upon heating, maybe they produce H2. But let me think of the reactions.

Wait, when the salts are heated without air, it's probably a decomposition reaction. So perhaps the salts A and B are metal carbonates or sulfates that decompose into metal oxides and CO2 or SO2 or something else. But since the gases don't have CO2 (as per tube 2), maybe they produce SO2 or H2 or another gas.

Wait, the gas after passing through tube 3 is 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP). So STP conditions are 0°C and 1 atm pressure, but sometimes 25°C is considered, but I think 0°C is more standard. So 22.4 liters per mole. 2.24 liters is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

What gas is left? Let's think about possible gases. If the initial gas mixture has H2O, perhaps H2, and SO2, and something else.

Wait, maybe the salts are nitrates. When nitrates decompose, they can produce NO2 or other oxides of nitrogen. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are sulfites or carbonates.

Wait, let me think again. The first tube absorbs H2O, so that's 3.60 g H2O. Then, the second tube, which is Ca(OH)2, doesn't react, so the gas doesn't have CO2. Then, the third tube (copper) gains 0.80 g. Let me think about possible reactions here.

When a gas is passed over hot copper, what could cause the copper to gain mass? Well, if the gas is SO2, then perhaps it's oxidized to SO3. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction with water vapor and copper, but that's not likely unless there's an acidic gas.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider what each tube does.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, especially for water. So any water vapor in the gas is absorbed here. So the mass gain here is the mass of water vapor in the gas. So 3.60 g H2O.

So moles of H2O: 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles.

Then, the gas goes into Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, it would react. But since the solution's weight didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2. So the remaining gas after tube 1 is a mixture of other gases that don't react with Ca(OH)2.

Then, the gas is passed over red-hot copper. The copper gains 0.80 g, forming CuO. So what's the reaction? Let's think: Cu is oxidized to CuO, so the gas must be acting as a reducing agent. So the gas could be H2 or CO. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with SO2.

Wait, if the gas is H2, it would react with CuO. But wait, Cu is in the form of metal. So maybe the gas is H2. Let me think, if H2 is passed over hot Cu, would it cause any reaction? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3, but that doesn't oxidize copper. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is SO2, which can react with Cu.

Wait, another possibility: When SO2 is passed over hot copper, it can form CuSO4. But the reaction might be:

4 Cu(s) + SO2(g) + 2 H2O → CuSO4 + 2 H2SO4? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps when SO2 is passed over Cu, it gets oxidized. Alternatively, perhaps it's the moisture in the gas reacting with Cu, but that seems less likely.

Wait, the copper is red-hot, so the surrounding conditions are high temperature. Maybe the gas is H2. Because H2 can react with CuO to form water. But in this case, the copper is in the metallic form, and the gas is H2. Would that cause any reaction? Hmm. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something else. Let's think about the amount of copper gained. The mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80 g. So, the product is CuO. Let's calculate how much Cu was oxidized.

Molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol. The mass increased
