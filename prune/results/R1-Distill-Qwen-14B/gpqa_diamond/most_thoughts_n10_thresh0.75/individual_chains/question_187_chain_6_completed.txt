Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and how many of the listed stars it can detect. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets, right? So it's probably good at getting detailed spectra of stars.

The question asks which stars are detectable based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. I remember that S/N depends on factors like the star's brightness, exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. So I need to figure out each star's brightness and see if it meets the S/N requirement.

Looking at the options:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc
d) Same V=15, 200 pc
e) Same V=15, 5 pc
f) Same V=15, 50 pc

Wait, wait. Absolute magnitude is different from apparent magnitude. Oh right, absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. So for option c, the absolute V is 15, but it's located at 10 pc, so its apparent magnitude would be the same as absolute? Because apparent magnitude is calculated based on distance. The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait, so let's calculate apparent magnitude for each:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. I recall that Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7, making it one of the brightest stars. So m is about -0.7.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star, a bit less bright than Canopus. Its apparent magnitude is about 2.1, I think.

c) V=15, 10 pc: Since M=15, d=10 pc. So m = 15 + 5*log(10/10) = 15 + 5*0 = 15. So apparent mag is 15.

d) M=15, d=200 pc. So m = 15 +5*log(200/10) = 15 +5*log(20) = 15 +5*(1.3010) ≈ 15 + 6.505 ≈ 21.5.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. m =15 +5*(log(5/10))= 15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505≈13.495.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. m=15 +5*log(50/10)=15 +5*(1.69897)=15 +8.494≈23.494.

Wait, so the apparent magnitudes are:

a) m ~-0.7 (very bright)
b) m ~2.1
c) m=15
d) m~21.5
e) m~13.5
f) m~23.5.

Now, I need to figure out which of these have S/N >=10 when observed for 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

ESPRESSO's performance depends on the star's brightness, right? So brighter stars will have higher S/N. I need to find the threshold apparent magnitude where the S/N is 10.

I think I need to find for each star what their expected S/N is. So, how does S/N scale with magnitude?

I remember that S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the flux. The flux F from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude.

So, S/N ∝ sqrt(t) * sqrt(F) = sqrt(t*F).

But I also need to consider the system's efficiency. So maybe the formula is S/N = k * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)), where m0 is some reference magnitude.

But I don't have the exact numbers, so perhaps I should look for the faintest apparent magnitude ESPRESSO can reach for a 1-hour exposure with S/N=10.

Alternatively, I can think about the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N. Let's say that for a certain m, S/N is 10. If a star is brighter than m, the S/N is higher than 10, so it's detectable. If it's fainter, S/N is lower than 10, not detectable.

So I need to find what is the maximum m (faintest star) that can achieve S/N=10 in 1 hour.

I think ESPRESSO's sensitivity is such that it can reach down to a certain magnitude. Maybe I can find this from the instrument's specifications.

Wait, looking up ESPRESSO's capabilities, I remember that it's designed to measure radial velocities with high precision. For that, it requires a sufficient S/N. I think for ESPRESSO, the typical S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness and the exposure time. 

I've heard numbers like ESPRESSO can reach S/N~10 per pixel for stars as faint as about magnitude 20 in a few minutes, but for 1 hour, it can go even fainter.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for S/N in a spectrograph.

The formula is:

S/N = (flux * exposure_time) / noise

But I think the noise is related to the sky background and the read noise. However, for a rough estimate, perhaps the S/N can be approximated as proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the star's flux.

Alternatively, I might remember that for a given instrument, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the star's flux.

The flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a reference magnitude (like m=0).

So, if I can find for a particular star, whether its flux in 1 hour gives S/N >=10.

Suppose, for example, that a star with m=15 gives S/N of about 10 in 1 hour. Then, brighter stars (lower m) would have higher S/N, and fainter stars (higher m) would have lower.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think: the lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the star.

So, let's suppose that for a star of apparent magnitude m, the S/N is S(m) = 10 * 2.51189^(0.5*(m - m_ref)), where m_ref is some reference magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a formula where S/N increases as the square root of the flux.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that the flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m). So F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F0 is the flux at some reference magnitude m0.

The S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t), assuming that the noise scales with the square root of the flux (since noise ~ sqrt(flux) from Poisson statistics), and t is the exposure time.

So S/N ∝ sqrt( F * t ) = sqrt( F0 * 10^(-0.4 m) * t )

Let me set up the equation for S/N =10:

10 = k * sqrt(F0 * 10^(-0.4 m) * t )

But without knowing k and F0, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a given instrument, the S/N for a star of magnitude m in time t is S(m,t) = S(m0, t0) * 2.51189^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t / t0)

Assuming that the reference S/N is known at a reference magnitude m0 and time t0.

Suppose that a star of magnitude m0 has S/N S0 in time t0. Then, for a star of magnitude m in time t, the S/N is:

S = S0 * (2.51189)^( -0.4*(m - m0) ) * sqrt( t / t0 )

Because the flux is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), which is F0 * (2.51189)^(-0.4*(m - m0)). So the S/N, which scales with sqrt(F), scales as 2.51189^(-0.2*(m - m0)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of how many magnitudes ESPRESSO can reach in 1 hour.

I think I've read that ESPRESSO can reach a S/N of 10 per pixel for stars as faint as about magnitude 20 in 1 hour. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some sources might indicate that it can go down to m=21 or so.

Wait, another approach is to consider the V magnitude and the distance. Because the apparent magnitude determines how bright the star appears, which in turn affects the S/N.

So for each star, I can compute their apparent magnitude, and then see if that is below (brighter than) the threshold where the S/N is 10.

If I assume that the threshold is, say, m_max = 20, then stars with m <=20 would be detectable.

Looking at the options:

a) m =-0.7 → detectable.

b) m=2.1 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → 21.5 is above 20, so not detectable.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=23.5 → no.

So the detectable stars are a, b, c, e.

That's four stars. So the correct answer would be 4, which is option C.

Wait, but I thought that the threshold was 20, but let me think again. Maybe the threshold is a bit brighter or fainter. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the S/N to find the maximum m that gives S/N=10.

Suppose that for a star of apparent magnitude m, the S/N is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t) * k,

where m0 is the reference magnitude (like the zero point), t is the exposure time in seconds, and k is some constant.

But without knowing the exact parameters, maybe I can find the maximum m such that S/N >=10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the relation between the apparent magnitude and the photon flux, which would determine the S/N.

The photon flux from a star is given by:

F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)),

where F0 is the flux at m0.

The S/N per pixel is then proportional to sqrt(F * t) over the noise. The noise comes from various sources: read noise, background photons, etc. But perhaps for simplicity, I can assume that the noise is dominated by the shot noise of the star's photons. So noise ~ sqrt(F), so S/N ~ sqrt(F * t).

So, S/N = k * sqrt( F * t ) = k * sqrt( F0 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)) * t )

We want S/N ≥10.

Let's say that for a certain m, S/N=10. Let's call that m_max.

But without knowing F0, m0, or k, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula based on the system's efficiency.

Another approach: I remember that the VLT's ESPRESSO can observe stars down to about 20th magnitude with S/N=10 in an hour. So any star brighter than m=20 would be detectable.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another source I recall said that ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 in about 20 minutes for a V=20 star. So in 1 hour, it can go a bit fainter.

Wait, 20 minutes would give m=20, so 1 hour (3 times longer) would allow m=20 - 2.5*log10(sqrt(3))= ?

Wait, let's think in terms of exposure time and magnitude. S/N is proportional to sqrt(t), so increasing exposure time by a factor of (t2/t1) increases S/N by sqrt(t2/t1).

If a star at m=20 gives S/N=10 in 20 minutes, then in 1 hour (3 times longer), the S/N would be sqrt(3)*10 ≈17.3. So m=20 would be detectable.

But wait, if a longer exposure allows the same S/N for a fainter star, then for the same S/N, a longer exposure can reach a fainter star.

Alternatively, perhaps the inverse. Let's say the question is about a 1-hour exposure.

Wait, if a star at m=20 gives S/N=10 in 20 minutes, then in 1 hour, you can observe stars that are 3 magnitudes fainter? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me think again. The S/N scales with sqrt(t). So, if for t1=20 min, S/N is 10 for m=20, then for t2=60 min, which is 3 times longer, S/N would be 10 * sqrt(3) ≈17.32 for m=20. But if the same exposure time is used for a fainter star, the S/N would be lower.

Wait, but what is the maximum m that can be achieved with 1-hour exposure to reach S/N=10.

Let me model it.

Let’s define:

At t1=20 min, for m=20, S/N1=10.

At t2=60 min, which is t2=3*t1.

For a star at m, the S/N would be S/N = (t2/t1)^(0.5) * 10^(0.4*(m -20)).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4(m - m0)).

The S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t) = sqrt(10^(-0.4(m - m0)) * t).

So, if for t1, S/N1=10 when m=20,

then for t2=3*t1, and m= m_x,

S/N2 = 10 * sqrt( (t2/t1) ) * 10^(-0.2*(m_x -20)).

We want S/N2 =10.

So,

10 = 10 * sqrt(3) * 10^(-0.2*(m_x -20)).

Divide both sides by 10:

1 = sqrt(3) * 10^(-0.2*(m_x-20)).

Take logs:

0 = 0.5 * ln(3) - 0.2 * (m_x -20) * ln(10).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to rearrange:

10^(-0.2*(m_x -20)) = 1/sqrt(3)

Take log base 10 of both sides:

-0.2*(m_x -20) = log10(1/sqrt(3)) = log10(3^(-0.5)) )= -0.5 * log10(3) ≈ -0.5 * 0.4771 ≈ -0.2386.

So,

-0.2 (m_x -20) = -0.2386.

Multiply both sides by -5:

(m_x -20) = 1.193.

So m_x =21.193.

Which is approximately 21.2. So with 1 hour exposure, a star of m=21.2 would have S/N=10.

Therefore, any star with m ≤21.2 can be detected (S/N ≥10).

Looking back at our options:

a) m=-0.7 → yes.

b) m=2.1 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no, because 21.5>21.2.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=23.5 → no.

So which stars are detectable?

a, b, c, e → four stars.

So the correct answer is 4, which is option C.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Brighter stars (lower \( m \)) will have higher S/N, while fainter stars (higher \( m \)) will have lower S/N. Based on ESPRESSO's sensitivity, it can achieve an S/N of 10 for stars as faint as \( m \approx 21.2 \) in 1 hour.

### Step 1: Calculate the apparent magnitude for each star
- **(a) Canopus**: Canopus has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \), making it very bright and easily detectable.
- **(b) Polaris**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.1 \), which is also bright and detectable.
- **(c) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)**:  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot 0 = 15
  \]
  This star is detectable since \( m = 15 < 21.2 \).
- **(d) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \)**:  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(20) \approx 15 + 5 \cdot 1.301 = 21.505
  \]
  This star is not detectable since \( m = 21.5 > 21.2 \).
- **(e) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)**:  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(0.5) \approx 15 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) = 13.495
  \]
  This star is detectable since \( m = 13.5 < 21.2 \).
- **(f) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \)**:  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot \log_{10}(5) \approx 15 + 5 \cdot 0.69897 = 23.495
  \]
  This star is not detectable since \( m = 23.5 > 21.2 \).

### Step 2: Determine detectability
From the calculations:
- **Detectable stars**: (a) \( m = -0.7 \), (b) \( m = 2.1 \), (c) \( m = 15 \), (e) \( m = 13.5 \).
- **Not detectable stars**: (d) \( m = 21.5 \), (f) \( m = 23.5 \).

Thus, **4 stars** are detectable.
