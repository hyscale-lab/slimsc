Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let's see what I can figure out. Hmm, the question gives me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures and planet masses, and asks about the orbital periods. 

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Oh, right, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the square root of (L/(16πσ d²)), but since the star's luminosity (L) and other constants are the same for all planets, the temperature ratio should relate to the distance.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16πσ d²))^(1/4), which simplifies to T proportional to (1/d)^(1/2). Because L and σ are constants here. So if T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1), or something like that. Let me get that right. 

Wait, let's think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same for all planets (0.3) so that part cancels out. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), where a is the orbital distance. Because bigger a (farther away) means lower temperature. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T ~ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). 

The problem states the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Using the formula above, that would be sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is about 1.96 times a1. So Planet2 is farther from the star than Planet1.
