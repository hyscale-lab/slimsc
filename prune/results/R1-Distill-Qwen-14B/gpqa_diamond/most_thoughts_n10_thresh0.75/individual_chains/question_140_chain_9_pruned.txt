Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll go through each part step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. Let me read the details again.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X might have an isotope, which is heavier than the common one. For example, maybe like Cl-35 vs Cl-37. That could be relevant for its properties.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, if the molecule's neutrons and protons are the same, maybe it's a noble gas? Because noble gases often form monoatomic molecules, but their atoms have equal protons and neutrons? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Each molecule would have the same number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule, if it's H2O, protons are 2 (from O) plus 2 from H, wait no, H2O has 8 protons (O has 8, H each 1; total O has 8, each H has 1, so 8+2=10 protons in the molecule). Neutrons would be 8 (from O) plus 1 each for two H's, so 10. Oh, wait, so same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? So H2O has 10 protons and 10 neutrons? H2O is actually H2O, so the molecule's total protons are 8 (O) + 2(1) = 10. Neutrons would be 8 (O has 8) + 2(0) = 8. Oh wait, no, that doesn't match. So maybe another molecule.

Wait, maybe gas W is CO2? Let's see. CO2 has one C (6 protons) and two O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 6 +16=22. Neutrons: C is 6 neutrons, O is 8 each, so 6 +2*8=22. Oh! So same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So W is CO2. That fits the description.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas when... Well, under certain conditions. But maybe that's possible. Alternatively, another gas? What about CH4? No, CH4 would have 6 protons (C) + 4 (H) =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 each, so 6. So 10 vs 6, no.

Wait, another option: NH3. Protons: 14 (N) + 3 (H) =17. Neutrons: in N, 7 (since N has 14-7=7). So 7 +3*(0) =7. 17 vs 7, no.

Wait, maybe it's O2? But O2 is O-O. Each O has 8 protons, so molecule has 16. Neutrons per O is 8, so 16. So 16 each, same. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in the molecule. That works. So W could be O2. Or another diatomic gas.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so for each O atom, 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So two O atoms would make 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same. So W could be O2. Or another like N2? Let's see. N has 7 protons. N2 is 14 protons. Neutrons: 7 each (since N is 14, 7 neutrons?), so 14. 14 each.

Wait, so O2 and N2 fit as well. Hmm.

So the reaction between X and Y produces W as gas, which could be O2 or N2, perhaps.

Then, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid at room temperature (since melting point is around 4 C). So which substance has a melting point near 4 C? Maybe something like water, but water freezes at 273 K (0 C). Hmm, 277 K is about 4 C. So perhaps B is some solid that melts around that temperature. Wait, maybe it's not water, but another compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice? No, because ice melts at 0 C. Hmm, perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound that when heated, releases gas W. Wait, let's think about what G could be.

G is a precipitate formed when X reacts with Y. So, perhaps a metal hydroxide or something else. When heated, it releases B, which is a solid with melting point around 277 K.

Wait, let's think about what X could be. Since X reacts with Y to produce a gas, perhaps it's a strong base reacting with an acid, but that's a guess. Alternatively, X could be a metal, and Y an acid, producing hydrogen gas. But earlier, I thought W could be O2 or N2. Let me think.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two oxygen atoms. That might suggest a reaction where an -OH group is added or something. Or perhaps, when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) reacts with X, the product has two O's. So, maybe X is something that adds an oxygen, like a peroxide or an oxidizing agent.

Wait, but another thought: maybe X is a strong base, like NaOH. Because NaOH reacts with acids to form salts, water, etc. But if X is a heavier isotope, perhaps it's K or another alkali metal with a heavier isotope. Alternatively, maybe X is a halogen, but heavier isotope.

Wait, going back, the problem says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. So, what reagents are used in organic chemistry? For example, KMnO4, NaOH, H2SO4, etc.

Wait, if X is NaOH, then Y could be an acid. Let's see. NaOH (X) reacts with an acid (Y), producing water (W), but wait, if W is O2, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like H2O2. H2O2 is
