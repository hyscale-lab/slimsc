Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, okay, the question gives me a lot of data, so I'll need to parse through it carefully.

So, there are two planets orbiting a star. Both have been detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet 1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet 2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions something about Doppler shifts from forbidden lines. Oh, right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. So, the shifts caused by each planet are given: Planet1 causes up to 0.03 Å shift, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, right, the formula I remember is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, I need their distances from the star. How do I get the distances from the given data?

The radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance) through the Doppler shift. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to the velocity via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c. But wait, the actual formula I think is v*sin(i) = (Δλ * c)/(λ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait another thought: the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the velocity semi-amplitude. The formula for K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_star) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) )^(2/3)
