Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, among the options A to D, I have to select the correct one. 

First, let's look at reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+. So, what's going on here. I know that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ is probably involved in the protonation step later.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—in this case, the spiro is at position 1. The structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro is between two rings: one is a 3-membered ring and the other a 5-membered ring. Wait, no, the nomenclature might be different. Spiro [3.5]non- something. The "non" suggests a 9-carbon system. Hmm, I think the spiro compound has a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring connected at C1, which is also the vinyl group and the OH group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The molecule has a spiro junction where two rings meet. The rings are likely a 3-membered (cyclopropane) and a 5-membered (cyclopentane) ring. The substituents on the spiro carbon are a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, it's 1-vinyl, so maybe CH₂CH₂ with the double bond?), and an OH group. Also, there's a double bond at position 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but I think the key is that the reaction involves some kind of elimination or ring formation.

The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and H+. So, THF is a good solvent for such reactions. KH is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something. The H+ at the end would protonate something.

Wait, this looks like a situation where an enol or enolate is formed. But wait, the starting material is an alcohol. So, the OH might be deprotonated by the strong base KH to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs, leading to the formation of a ketone or some kind of cyclic structure.

Alternatively, I remember that when you have a spiro alcohol and a base, it can lead to a pinacol-like rearrangement or some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols losing water to form a carbonyl. But this is a spiro alcohol with a double bond nearby, perhaps.

Wait, another possibility: the compound might undergo an acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed elimination. Since we have a strong base, maybe it's an E2 elimination. The OH is on the spiro carbon, and H could be abstracted to form a double bond. But given the structure, perhaps it's more about forming a bicyclic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization. Wait, the presence of H+ at the end suggests that after deprotonation, there's a protonation step, maybe forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: in certain conditions, especially with strong bases, some alcohols can undergo elimination to form ketones or other carbonyl compounds. If the spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it might lose a water molecule and form a carbonyl. 

Alternatively, maybe this is a case where the base abstracts a proton leading to an elimination, which could form a new ring. Since the starting compound is spiro, perhaps it's a ring-opening or a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, let's think about the product structures given in the options. For product A, options are (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one or decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one.

Bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one has a bridge structure. The bicyclo notation indicates the number of carbons in each bridge. So, 5, 3, and 1, making a norbornene-like structure perhaps with a ketone. The other option is benzo[7]annulen, which is a polycyclic compound—a benzene ring fused to another ring, perhaps.

So, perhaps the starting material undergoes a ring-forming elimination. The spiro alcohol would lose a water molecule, forming a carbonyl and creating a new ring.

Wait, let me think mechanism. The spiro alcohol, when treated with a strong base like KH, would deprotonate the OH to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an E2 elimination occurs, where the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the OH, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of water. But wait, in this case, the starting material already has a double bond (since it's 5-en). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type elimination, but with a spiro alcohol. Wait, pinacol is a 1,2-diol, but here we have a spiro alcohol with a double bond. Maybe not pinacol, but perhaps a different kind of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a cleavage
