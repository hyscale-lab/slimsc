Okay, let's see. I have to figure out the products of three different Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I've studied some organic chemistry, so I'll try to recall what I know.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition, so I think I need to determine the reactants and products for each.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a diester with enolate-forming groups. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate must be the Michael acceptor here because it's the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So the Michael donor (nucleophile) is the enolate of dimethyl malonate. The acceptor is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. When they react, the enolate attacks the beta position of the acceptor. In the case of the acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent in the E configuration, which probably doesn't affect the reaction much, but the position is important.

Wait, the acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, wait, the acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group. Hmm, maybe it's more like (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)propenoate methyl ester. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but in the E configuration, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl
