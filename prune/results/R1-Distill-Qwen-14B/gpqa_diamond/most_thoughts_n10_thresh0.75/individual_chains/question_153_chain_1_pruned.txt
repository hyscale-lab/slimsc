Okay, I've got this problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break down each part of the question.

First, looking at reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. In the Michael reaction, the enolate of the nucleophile would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the malonate has two ester groups, so when the attack happens, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the substituents on the double bond in the E configuration. Wait, no, the structure is probably CH2-O-C(O)-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, the position is 3, so maybe it's CH2=CH-p-tolyl with a carbonyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurately CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? That doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl with a carbonyl ester group. Actually, I think the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but arranged in the (E) configuration. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl on C2 and the carbonyl on C3. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks, it would add to the beta carbon (C2), forming a new bond. Then the product would have the malonate part connected to the p-tolyl group.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3O)2C-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Dimethyl malonate is H2C(COOCH3)2. So the structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it forms the enolate, the negative charge is on the central carbon, and the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, the acrylate is probably CH2=CHCO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate might be CH2=C(O-p-tolyl)COO
