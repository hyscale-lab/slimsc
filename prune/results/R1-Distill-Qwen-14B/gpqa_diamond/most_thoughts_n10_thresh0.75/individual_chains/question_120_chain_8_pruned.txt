Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So the formula is distance d = 1/plx. But wait, in what unit? Oh, right, parsecs. So the parallax in arcseconds gives the distance in parsecs.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, if we consider a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same everywhere. But wait, number density in what? In space, right. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

But wait, how does volume relate to parallax? Let's think about it. If we're looking at a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dd, the volume of that shell would be the surface area times the thickness. Since d = 1/plx, and the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², but wait, when we're considering a thin shell, the volume would be approximately 4πd² dd. 

But since we're dealing with parallax, which is p = 1/d, let's express the volume in terms of p. So d = 1/p. The thickness in distance terms is dd, but we need to express this in terms of the change in parallax, dplx.
