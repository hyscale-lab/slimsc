Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Since beta is 1/(kT), and we're working in units where k is included, it's just summing exp(-E/(kT)) which is exp(-β E).

So each spin can be +1 or -1. For three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being either +1 or -1.

But maybe I can find a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that might take time, and I might make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the possible values of the energy E for each state, and then count how many states have each energy.

Yes, that's a better approach. Because E depends on the products S_i S_j. Each product can be +1 or -1. Let me think:

Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 otherwise. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary.

Wait, let's denote each product as a, b, c:

a = S1 S2
b = S1 S3
c = S2 S3

So E = -J(a + b + c). So the energy is proportional to the sum of these three terms.

Let me find all possible values of a + b + c.

Wait, let's think about possible combinations. Since each of a, b, c can be +1 or -1, the sum can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, perhaps?

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that for three spins, the sum S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 can take different values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the number of neighboring pairs that are aligned or anti-aligned. But wait, in this case, each pair contributes +1 if aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. So the sum is (number of aligned pairs)*2 - 3, because each aligned
