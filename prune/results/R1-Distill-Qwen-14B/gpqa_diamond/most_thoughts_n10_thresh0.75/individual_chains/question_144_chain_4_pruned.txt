Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, what's the mean decay distance? I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time. The mean lifetime is related to the width of the particle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy and time are inversely related.

The formula for the mean lifetime τ is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. And once we have the lifetime, the mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, how do we find the speed? That depends on the energy and mass of the particle.

Wait, but the production energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle isn't at rest when it's produced. So, it's moving at some relativistic speed. I'll need to calculate its velocity.

First, let's handle the lifetime. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but units are important. So Γ is 320 MeV. I should convert that to GeV to match the units of E and m. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV.

Then, τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The value of ħ in units of GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, let me think. Actually, ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm, but I might need to check the right units here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to handle the units in compatible terms. Let's calculate τ in seconds.

So, Γ is 0.32 GeV. To get τ in seconds, I need to use ħ in GeV·s. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32. Hmm, 0.32 is 32/100, so 6.582 * (100/32) = 6.582 * (25/8) ≈ 6.582 * 3.125 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = approx 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is 2.056875e-24. Correct.

But wait, do I remember the value of ħ correctly? Let me think. Another way: ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, that's correct.

So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds. Is that right? Let me double-check. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 6.582/(3.2e1) * 1e-25. Oh wait, no, 0.32 is 3.2e-1
