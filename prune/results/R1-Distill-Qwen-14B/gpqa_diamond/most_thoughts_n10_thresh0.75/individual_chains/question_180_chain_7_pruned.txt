Okay, so I have this problem about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to break it down. The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that.

Twelve of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, okay, so this is an isolated system. So I think that means we're dealing with the electrostatic potential energy here.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So I'm guessing that the system's potential energy is being considered here. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy is the energy due to the configuration of charges.

So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So that charge at P is fixed, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away. Or wait, no. The way the question is phrased, 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are at 2m, and the 13th is at P. So each of those 12 is a distance of 2m from P.

Wait, but each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge, which is at P.

So each of those 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the fixed charge also has 2e. So each pair between the fixed charge and the 12 others will contribute to potential energy.

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? The problem says the system is isolated, so I think all interactions matter. So the total potential energy must be the sum of the potential energies between every pair.

But wait, the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r.

So since each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, the fixed charge, each of those 12 has a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. So the potential energy from each of those
