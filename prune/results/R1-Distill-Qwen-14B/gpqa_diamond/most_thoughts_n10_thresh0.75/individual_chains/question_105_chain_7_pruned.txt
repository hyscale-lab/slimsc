Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When observed over time, the star's brightness changes periodically because it's rotating, showing these spots. And the interesting part is that this brightness variation might look similar to the dip caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star.

The question is asking: if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would be the radius of that planet relative to the star? The options are A to D.

Wait, so the key here is to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the dip in brightness (the transit depth) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

But wait, how do the spots cause the variation? So the star is rotating, and as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness drops because the spots are cooler and emit less light. The same effect as a planet transiting the star, blocking some light.

So, I think I need to calculate the change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same change.

First, let's model the star's brightness without spots. The star emits with an effective temperature of 6000 K, similar to the Sun.

The flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But since we'll be comparing relative changes, maybe I can work with relative fluxes.

When the star has spots, each spot has a lower temperature (T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K). The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is half the surface. But the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots. Wait, no, it says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So that means 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) since a hemisphere is 2πR². Wait, no, wait. The star's surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So if the filling factor is 20% in one hemisphere, the area of spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no, wait again. If the star is observed and one hemisphere (so half the star) has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere, then the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². So the total area of the spots is 0.4πR².

But how does this affect the total flux?

The star's total flux without spots would be F_total = σTeff⁴ * (4πR²) / (4
