Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a star with some spots and how their presence affects the brightness variations observed, similar to an exoplanet transit. We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as the spots do.

First, let's understand the given information. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Hmm, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 0.2, then 20% of that hemisphere is spots. But wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered, so the entire hemisphere is the area where spots can be. So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) is the total area covered by spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I think, because starspots are usually darker and cooler regions. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so the spots are at 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

The problem says that because of the spots, the brightness variations look similar to a planet transiting the star. But we're to find what planet radius would give the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

So, I need to calculate the change in brightness (the amplitude of the dip) caused by the spots and then find what planet radius would cause the same dip.

Wait, but when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because when a planet passes in front, it blocks that area, which is a fraction of the star's area.

But in the case of spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the brightness decreases. But since the spots are on only one hemisphere, the modulation would be due to the rotation. But when considering the maximum dip, it's when the spots are fully facing us, I think.

Wait, no, when the star is rotating, the spots move into and out of view. So as one hemisphere is covered with spots, when the star is rotating, the brightness changes as the spotted area comes into view. But the maximum dip would be when the maximum number of spots is visible.

But wait, actually, the problem states that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the observed brightness variation is similar to a planet transit. Therefore, the amplitude of the brightness dip caused by the spots is similar to that of a planet.

So, let's compute the dip caused by the spots. The dip is (delta_flux) = (area of spots) * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) / (total area of star) ?

Wait, no, the flux from the star is the sum of the flux from all regions. When some regions are cooler, the total flux emitted is less. So the change in flux is (Area of spots) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / (sigma) ) * (1/ (4 pi R_star^2) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total flux when spots are visible and compare it to the flux when the spots are not visible.

But perhaps a simpler way is to calculate the fractional decrease in flux when the spots are in view.

The total flux when no spots are visible is F0 = (sigma * T_eff^4) * (area of star) / (4 pi R_star^2) )? Wait, no, the star's luminosity is L = 4 pi R_star^2 sigma T_eff^4. So the surface flux per unit area is sigma T_eff^4. 

When spots are present, the flux from the spotted area is lower. The fractional decrease in flux is (fraction of area covered) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

Wait, perhaps let's think in terms of the area covered and the temperature difference.

The star has a radius R, so surface area is 4 pi R^2. But the spots cover a hemisphere, which would have an area of 2 pi R^2. The filling factor is 20% of this hemisphere, so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

So the area of the spots is A_spot = 0.4 pi R^2.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = L = 4 pi R^2 * sigma * T_eff^4.

The flux when spots are visible is F_spot = F0 - (A_spot * sigma (T_spot^4)) ) + (A_spot * sigma (T_spot^4))? Wait, no, the total flux without spots is F0. When spots are present, the flux is F0 - (A_spot) * (sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) ) / (something?), wait maybe I should think in terms of the star's total emission.

Wait, each part of the star emits flux based on its temperature. So without spots, the entire star emits F0. When there are spots, the area of the spots emits at a lower temperature.

So the total flux becomes:

F = (Area_unspotted * sigma T_eff^4) + (Area_spotted * sigma T_spot^4)

The area_unspotted is (4 pi R^2 - A_spot), but wait, no, because the spots are on a hemisphere. Wait, wait, no, the star's total surface is 4 pi R^2, and the spots cover A
