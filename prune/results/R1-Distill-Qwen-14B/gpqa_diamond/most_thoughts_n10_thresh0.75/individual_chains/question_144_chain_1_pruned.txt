Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance and its decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so I'm guessing it's something related to the uncertainty principle or particle decay lengths.

Wait, I remember that particles that are unstable decay quickly, and their decay length depends on their lifetime. The mean decay distance is how far they travel before decaying. So I think the first thing I need is the lifetime of the meson X.

The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for decay processes, Γ is the total decay width, which is the uncertainty in energy (ΔE ≈ Γ), and τ is the mean lifetime. So the relation is Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure I have the units right. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units like eV·s or something. Let me think: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Since Γ is in MeV, I should convert that to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, but I thought it's ħ divided by Γ, so that would be 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Once I have the lifetime, the next step is to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance is velocity multiplied by lifetime: L = v * τ. But wait, velocity depends on the energy and mass. Hmm, how
