Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The given information includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. I think I need to calculate the mean decay length using these values.

Wait, how do I approach this? I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The width Γ is connected to the particle's lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, since Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy times time, dividing them gives time. So yes, that makes sense.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the mean decay distance would be the speed v multiplied by τ. But wait, how do I find the speed of the meson? Oh right, I can calculate the velocity from the energy and mass. The meson is produced with energy E, so using relativistic equations, perhaps.

Wait, the production energy is given as 8 GeV, but the rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is moving with some kinetic energy. I think the total energy is E = γ m c²,
