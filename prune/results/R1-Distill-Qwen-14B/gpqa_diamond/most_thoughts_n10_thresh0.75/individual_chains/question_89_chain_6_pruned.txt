Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me jot down the steps and see what each reaction does.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, perhaps forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a bicyclic compound. When two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between those carbons. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but wait, the NMR data says 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a -O- group. Oh wait, KOH in elimination would lead to formation of an epoxide? No, wait, elimination from vicinal dihalides usually forms alkenes. But wait, sometimes with strong bases, maybe it's an elimination where the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the NMR shows 4.79 ppm, which is more like an oxygen-bearing group. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution? Or wait, maybe it's an epoxide formation. But wait, KOH and vicinal dihalide, maybe that's more of an E2 elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution with KOH forming a diol? Wait, let me think. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH in excess would probably lead to elimination, not substitution, because vicinal dihalides under E2 conditions form alkenes. But then, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which is a doublet maybe as a -CHO or an ester? Or perhaps an epoxide?

Wait, let me think about the product when a dihalide reacts with KOH. If it's a di-substitution, we'd get a diol. But if it's elimination, we get an alkene. Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which is
