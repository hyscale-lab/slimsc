Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? It's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions like addition, substitution, etc.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, I think when ketones react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond, so maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, wait! Wait, maybe I'm thinking of something else. Oh wait, cyclohexanone isn't a diene, but bromine could add into a ring-opening or maybe a ring substitution? Or wait, another thought: maybe it's a ring-opening via some kind of electrophilic attack.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, another approach: cyclohexanone under certain conditions can undergo bromination. Oh wait, maybe it's a haloform reaction? But that's when you have a methyl ketone. Oh wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone but not a methyl ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination via enol formation. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugate addition? But cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone; the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps the bromine is adding via a Diels-Alder type reaction, but wait, that's for dienes and dienophiles. No, that doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, I'm forgetting something. Oh! Cyclohexanone can undergo a ring-opening via a hemiacetal-like pathway, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a bromine in a different solvent. Or wait, maybe it's a radical bromination? No, that might not apply here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the bromine is adding across the carbonyl group. No, because ketones typically don't add bromine in the same way that alkenes do. Oh wait, wait! Bromine can add to the carbonyl in a cyclic intermediate. So when a ketone is treated with bromine, maybe it forms a bromoketone? Like
