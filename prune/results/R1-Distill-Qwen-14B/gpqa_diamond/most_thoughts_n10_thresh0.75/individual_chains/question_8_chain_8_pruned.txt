Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine regarding resistance to anthracnose. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that they've identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels of these mutants are given compared to the wild type, which is 100%.

The results are:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about the gene interactions. The options involve transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

First, I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of A masks or modifies the phenotype of B.

Transcription factors are proteins that help turn specific genes on or off by binding to nearby DNA. So, if a transcription factor is upstream, it would regulate other genes. The problem says at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, perhaps it's the one with the strongest effect when knocked out.

Looking at the single mutants:
- g2 is 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So knocking out G2 completely abolishes resistance. So G2 might be a transcription factor because without it, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

Wait, but wait, the problem says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the TF.

Now, looking at G3. g3 has 50% resistance. So half the resistance of wild type. So knocking out G3 alone reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. 

G1 knockout is 75% resistance. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance but not as much as G3. So without G1, the plant is more susceptible than wild type but not as much as when G3 is knocked out. Hmm, that's interesting.

Now, let's look at the double mutants. 

g1g3 is 10% resistance. That's way worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either alone. That suggests that perhaps these genes are working in parallel pathways. Because when both parts are missing, the effect is additive or more than each alone.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, in double mutants, if one gene is epistatic to the other, the phenotype could be the same as the more severe single mutant. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g2, which it does here (0% vs 0%). Similarly, g2g3 is 0% which is same as g2, so G2 might be epistatic to G3 as well.

Looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (worse than either)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
So, when you have G2 knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%. In double mutants with G2, regardless of the other gene, the resistance is 0. So, in g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2. So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

But wait, what about g1g3? That's 10%
