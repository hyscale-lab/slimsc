Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct concentration.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and when it complexes with metal ions like Ca²+, it forms a complex. The formation constant (K) is a measure of how strong the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable, so the metal is more tightly bound.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Wait, but what's the stoichiometry here? Typically, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) forms a 1:1 complex with metal ions. So the formula would be something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So each complex has one Ca²+ ion.

So the question is, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, what is the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution?

I think I need to use the formation constant expression. The formation constant Kf is defined as:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA])

But wait, in solution, EDTA can be in different protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think implies that all the EDTA is in the form that can complex with Ca²+. So I don't have to worry about the different protonation states here. So I can treat EDTA as Y^4-.

So given that, the expression becomes Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, because the solution contains only the complex, and assuming that the EDTA and Ca²+ are all tied up in the complex, right? Because if the complex is 0.02 M, then each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA (in the form Y^4-).

Wait, no, because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4-. But the formation constant is so large (5e10) that the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and Y^4- should be very low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote:

[CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

Let me think about the dissociation. Let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Then, the concentration of Y^4- would also be x, because each complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4-.

So the equation would be:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2, so square root is 2e-6.5. Hmm, but wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 2 * 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 6.324e-7.

So x ≈ 6.324e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Because sometimes I might get confused between formation constants and dissociation constants.

Another approach: the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

Assuming that all the EDTA and Ca²+ are in the complex, but some dissociates. Let's say the initial concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. Let's let s be the amount that dissociates. So:

[Ca²+] = s
[Y^4-] = s

And [CaY²-] = 0.02 - s. But since Kf is so large, s will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY²-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kf ≈ 0.02/(s²) =5e10.

So solving for s: s² =0.02/(5e10)= 4e-13, s= sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Yep, so that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, the formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M. Since the stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1, the dissociation of the complex releases one \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ion and one \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ion. Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

\[
x = 2 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.3162 \approx 6.324 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
