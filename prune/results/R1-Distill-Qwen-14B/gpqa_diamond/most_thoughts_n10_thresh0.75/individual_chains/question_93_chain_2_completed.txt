Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He uses a positive control with known copy numbers and dilutes it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle increases the target by exactly double. The R² is 1, which is a perfect correlation, meaning the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. Oh right, the formula for the slope is -3.32 divided by the efficiency. Since the efficiency is 100%, the slope should be around -3.32. So a slope of -3.3 makes sense here.

Looking at his results, the Ct values increase as the concentration decreases, which is what I'd expect. Higher starting template means lower Ct (because it reaches threshold sooner). So for each tenfold dilution, the Ct should increase by a certain amount. Given a 100% efficient reaction, each tenfold dilution should lead to an increase of about 3.32 cycles. Let me check each set.

Starting with 100,000 copies: Ct is around 33.9-34.5. Then at 10,000 copies, it's 30.6-31.2. The difference there is about 3.3 cycles (33.9 minus 30.6 is about 3.3). Similarly, from 10,000 to 1,000, 30.6 to 27.3, again a 3.3 difference. Same for 1,000 to 100: 27.3 to 24, so about 3.3. And from 100 to 10 copies: 24 to 20.7—differences about 3.3 again.

Wait, but each of these differences is exactly matching the expected 3.3 cycles. So why are the options suggesting there's a discrepancy?

Looking at the options:

Option A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But the efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, so data is perfect. So A is probably wrong because qPCR is used for quantification, and this setup shows it's working.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target amounts. But in this case, they do. The Ct values are exactly as expected for each tenfold dilution. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, no, it's exactly 3.3 cycles. Because each tenfold dilution (which is a factor of 10) would require log2(10) ≈3.32 cycles. So the slope being -3.3 aligns with that. So ten-fold leads to a 3.3 Ct increase. So C is saying that ten-fold is more than 3.3 cycles. But in reality, it's about 3.32, which is close. Hmm, but the question is about discrepancies in the results. So perhaps the Ct values don't match exactly, but in this case, they do. So I'm not sure yet.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Let's look at the data.

At 100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences between each are 0.3, 0.3, and overall from 33.9 to 34.5 is 0.6. So the standard deviation or the max deviation is 0.6. Similarly, other concentrations:

10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Max deviation 0.6 again.

So the deviation between replicates is 0.3 to 0.6. The question is, is this acceptable?

I remember that in qPCR, technical replicates should have a low standard deviation, like less than 0.5 cycles. So if the replicates are within 0.3 of each other, that's good. But in the data, the maximum deviation is about 0.6. For example, 33.9 to 34.5 is a 0.6 difference. So the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3, which could indicate a problem.

Wait, but the question says which option explains the discrepancies in his results. His results, looking at the Ct values, show that each concentration's average is about 3.3 cycles higher than the next. That's perfect. But the technical replicates have a deviation of up to 0.6. So perhaps the reason is that the technical replicates have a deviation more than 0.3.

So the question is about why the results show discrepancies. The question states that the efficiency is 100%, R² is 1. So the calibration curve is perfect. But the Ct values of the technical replicates have a higher deviation than acceptable.

Looking back at the options, D says the deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. That's exactly what's happening here. So this would be the correct answer, as it's a possible discrepancy.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about why the results have discrepancies. The calibration curve is perfect, so maybe the issue isn't with the curve but with the technical replicates.

In the setup, the scientist is making a calibration curve. The data for the curve is from the averages of the replicates, which are all tightly following the expected values. But the individual technical replicates have a larger variation than 0.3, which could be a problem. So the issue here is not with the curve, but perhaps with the technical replicates themselves—maybe they're not as consistent as they should be.

So the answer would be D, because the deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3. Thus, the results (the Ct values) may not be reliable because the technical replicates have this high variability.

So the correct option is D.


The question involves analyzing discrepancies in qPCR results where the scientist generated a calibration curve using serially diluted positive controls and technical replicates. The qPCR efficiency is 100%, the R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3, which aligns with the expected relationship between efficiency and slope for a perfect calibration curve. The Ct values increase by approximately 3.3 cycles for each tenfold dilution, consistent with the theoretical expectation for a 100% efficient reaction.

However, the technical replicates show deviations of up to 0.6 cycles (e.g., 33.9 to 34.5 at 100,000 copies). In qPCR, technical replicates are expected to have a low deviation, typically less than 0.5 cycles. Here, the deviation exceeds this threshold, indicating potential inconsistency in the technical replicates. This could affect the reliability of the results, even though the calibration curve appears perfect.

Option A is incorrect because qPCR is a valid method for nucleic acid quantification, and the data shows a perfect calibration curve. Option B is incorrect because the Ct values align well with the expected amounts of target nucleic acid. Option C is incorrect because the tenfold dilution corresponds to a 3.3-cycle increase, which is consistent with the data. Option D is correct because the deviation between technical replicates exceeds 0.3 cycles, which is a recognized discrepancy in qPCR experiments.

Answer: D
