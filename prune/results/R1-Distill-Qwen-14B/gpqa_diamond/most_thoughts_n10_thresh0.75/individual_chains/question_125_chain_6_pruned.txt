Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². They're asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the quantum numbers in each of the three dimensions. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy should depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Right, the energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, sometimes people use a different notation where the total quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E can also be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers.

Now, the problem asks about the third excited state. Wait, what's the ground state? The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. So n = 0 in that case. The first excited state would be the next energy level, which is when n=1. Then, the second excited state is n=2, and the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy of the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That seems to match option A or C. Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, and option C has the same energy.

Now, the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. So we need to find how many ways we can have n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Because for each state with a given n, the number of states is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

Wait, that's a combinatorial problem
