Okay, so I have this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are from 10^59 to 10^66 J/K, so I need to calculate which one it is.

Wait, right, the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find A first.

Angular size θ is given, and I remember that angular size relates to the actual size through the formula θ ≈ s/d, where s is the size and d is the distance, when θ is in radians. Oh wait, right, because θ (in radians) is approximately the ratio of the arc length (s) to the radius (d). So s = θ * d, but I have to convert θ from degrees to radians first.

So first, θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. 1e-17 degrees is about 1.745e-19 radians (since π/180 is approx 0.01745). So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the size s of the event horizon is θ_rad * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec in meters? I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So s = θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) meters. Let me calculate that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7. 1.745 *3 is about 5.235, so maybe 5.38. So s ≈5.38e7 meters. Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7 (since -19 +26 =7). 1.745 *3.086 is approximately 5.39. So s is about 5.39e7 meters. Hmm, wait, wait, 5.39e7 is 5.39 x 10^7 meters, which is 53,900,000 meters, or 5.39e4 kilometers. That seems quite large, but supermassive black holes do have big event horizons.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So the event horizon's radius is R = R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So the area A is 4 π R^2 = 4 π (2 G M / c^2)^2. Alternatively, A = 16 π G² M² / c^4. But maybe there's a way to express A in terms of the Schwarzschild radius and the given angular size.

Wait, another approach: the angular size of the event horizon is θ = (2
