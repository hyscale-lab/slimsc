Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering. I remember that in such experiments, the scattering amplitude is important. The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts are delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, delta_3, delta_4... Oh wait, these are the phase shifts for each angular momentum state, right?

The measured phase shifts are delta_0=90 degrees, delta_1=67 degrees, delta_2=55, delta_3=30 degrees, and delta_4=13 degrees. So each delta corresponds to a different l value. I think l starts at 0 and goes up, so delta_0 is for l=0, delta_1 for l=1, and so on.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, the scattering amplitude is often represented as f(l, theta), and it's usually complex. The imaginary part would be related to the phase shifts somehow.

I recall that the scattering amplitude f for each partial wave is given by f(l, theta) = (1/(k l)) * [something involving the phase shifts]. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think about the optical theorem or partial wave expansion.

Wait, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude f is a sum over l of (2l+1) * (f_l * P_l(cosÎ¸)), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here
