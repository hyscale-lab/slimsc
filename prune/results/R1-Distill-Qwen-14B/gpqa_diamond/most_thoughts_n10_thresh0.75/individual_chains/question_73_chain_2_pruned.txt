Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says, two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right, when dealing with velocities and relativity, I remember that you can't just add the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but wait, relative speed depends on the frame of reference. So if one astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to Earth, and the other at 0.5c, what's their relative speed?

Wait, no, actually, I think the question is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So they're moving in the same direction, so the relative velocity would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

The formula for relativistic velocity addition is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the first frame, and v is the velocity of the second frame relative to the first. So in this case, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. Let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and is moving at 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m and is moving at 0.5c. So we're looking for the speed of B relative to A, since A is moving at 0.6c, and B is at 0.5c. Since both are in the same direction, from A's perspective, B is moving slower. So the relative speed would be u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, so in this case, relative to A, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, but 0.5c minus 0.6c is negative 0.1c. So u' is
