Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about determining which genes are transcription factors and how they interact based on their knockout mutants' resistance to anthracnose. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in genetics, when you have knock-out mutants, their phenotype can help determine gene function. Here, the resistance to the fungus anthracnose is the phenotype being measured. A higher resistance means the plant is more resistant, so lower values mean more susceptibility.

The setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. Each has a knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3). There are also double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The data shows their resistance levels compared to the wild-type.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So their knockout would affect the downstream genes, leading to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. Wild-type is 100%, so this mutant has 75% of that. So it's less resistant than wild type but not as bad as the others. So the function of G1 is partially contributing to resistance.

- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So without G2, the plants are completely susceptible. This suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, possibly a transcription factor since it's completely necessary for resistance.

- g3: 50% resistance. So it's halfway as resistant as the wild type. So G3 contributes to resistance but isn't as crucial as G2.

Looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Hmm, so combining the two makes things much worse. So maybe these genes are in a pathway, and when both are knocked out, the effect is additive or synergistic.

- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So when G3 is knocked out in addition to G2, resistance doesn't get any worse than just g2. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2, or that G2 is upstream, so without G2, G3 doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked.

Wait, that's the concept of epistasis. If the double mutant g2g3 has the same phenotype as g2, G2 is epistatic to G3. So whatever G3 does is downstream of G2. So if G2 isn't working, then G3 can't help because it's further along the pathway.

Similarly, looking at g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So without G2, the presence of G1 knockout doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1 as well. So G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3.

Wait, but how does that fit with the single mutants' data? If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 should disable both genes. So the resistance would be as bad as if both G1 and G3 are not working. But looking at g1's resistance at 75%, which is better than both G2 and G3, that suggests that G1's function is perhaps partially compensating when G2 is present.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So that's worse than g1 or g3 alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, and knocking both out leads to more severe resistance loss. But in the presence of G2, G1 and G3 may provide some redundancy or additive effects.

Wait, let me think again. The single mutant g2 has 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen. That suggests that G2 is necessary for resistance. So G2 being a transcription factor makes sense; it's required for the expression of other genes needed for resistance.

In the double mutants involving G2, like g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is 0% in both cases. So without G2, whether you also have G1 or G3 knocked out doesn't make things worse. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because without G2, the function of G1 and G3 doesn't matterâ€”they don't contribute anything.

Looking at the other double mutant, g1
