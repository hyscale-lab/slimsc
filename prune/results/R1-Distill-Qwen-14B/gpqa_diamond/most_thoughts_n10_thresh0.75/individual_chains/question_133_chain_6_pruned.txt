Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in this solution at 25°C. The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? But when it's deprotonated, the species in solution can be H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3- or HPO4^2-? Hmm, sometimes orthophosphate refers to the triply deprotonated form, PO4^3-, but sometimes people might refer to HPO4^2- as orthophosphate as well. I need to clarify this. Wait, the problem statement says "orthophosphate ions", which I think refers to PO4^3- because that's the fully deprotonated form. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the term refers to the HPO4^2- form. Well, perhaps the solution will become clear as I go on.

So, the problem gives us two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4
