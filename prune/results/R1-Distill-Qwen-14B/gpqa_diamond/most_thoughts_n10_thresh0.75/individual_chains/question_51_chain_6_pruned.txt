Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think it through.

The question is: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But here, we have a conducting sphere which is grounded. Oh right, grounding means it's connected to the earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the earth. For a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface.

So when we place a charge q near the sphere, what happens? The conducting sphere will redistribute its charge to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow into the ground. Oh wait, no, actually, a conducting sphere can have induced charges but if it's grounded, it can have a net charge? Or does it stay neutral?

Wait, hold on. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, any charges induced on it can move to the ground. So when we bring a charge q near the sphere, the sphere's electrons will redistribute. The side closer to q will have induced negative charges, and the opposite side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, the positive charges can't build up on the sphere; instead, the sphere will lose electrons to the ground, right? So the sphere might end up with a net positive charge? Or wait, no. Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so when a positive charge is near, the electrons in the sphere move away, leaving the near side positively charged. Since the sphere is grounded, these positive charges can't stay on the sphere; instead, the sphere will have electrons flow in from the ground to the far side, leaving the near side positive. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere being grounded means it's at zero potential. But in that case, the induced charges will adjust to make the potential zero. Wait, but when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero, considering the charge q and the induced charges.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the potential energy. The system's potential energy would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere,
