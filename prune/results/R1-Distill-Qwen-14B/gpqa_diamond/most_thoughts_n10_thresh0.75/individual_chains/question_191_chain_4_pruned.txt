Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an isopropenyl group. So, that's like a CH2 group attached to a double bond: CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH(CH2?), wait no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2- attached where? Wait, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure is CH2=C(CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think of prop-1-en-2-yl as CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- but as a substituent, perhaps it's CH2-C(CH2-... Hmm, maybe it's better to sketch it.

So the starting molecule is a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is CH2-C(=CH2)-. Hmm, maybe it's like a vinyl group attached to another methyl? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: prop-1
