Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium atom has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is protons plus neutrons, so 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6. That's helpful because I'll need the mass of the nucleus for calculations.

Next, the problem is about relativistic speeds because 0.96c is pretty close to the speed of light. So I should use relativistic equations here. Specifically, I think I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

Calculating the denominator first: v²/c² is (0.96c)² / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784)... wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1, right? Yeah, because 0.28 * 3.5714 is approximately 1. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, I also need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is approximately the atomic mass. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). So I'll need to convert that into kilograms because the standard units for energy in relativity are joules, but since the answer is in GeV, maybe I can work in units where c² is accounted for, perhaps using energy in terms of mass.

Wait, but what's the mass of one atomic mass unit in kilograms? I remember that 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kilograms. So for Li-6, mass m = 6 u = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 9.963234e-27 kg.

But another approach is to use the conversion from mass to energy. Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Because E = mc², so 1 u is 931.5 MeV. So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Wait, but that's the rest energy, so E_rest = m c² = 5.589 GeV.

Then the total energy E is gamma multiplied by E_rest. So E = gamma * 5.589 GeV. We found gamma as approximately 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.589 ≈ let me calculate that.

3.5714 * 5.589. Let's see, 3 *5=15, 0.5714 *5.589 is about 3.196. So 15 +3.196 is about 18.196 GeV. Wait, that's about 18.196 GeV. But looking at the options, option A is 18.475 GeV. Hmm, maybe I approximated gamma too roughly. Let me check the exact gamma value.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately. So more accurately, 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I multiplied gamma by 5.589, I'm getting around 19.8 or something? Wait, no, let me recalculate. 3.57142857 * 5.589 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.589.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me do the multiplication step by step.

First, 3 *5.589 = 16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589 = ?

0.5 *5.589 = 2.7945

0.07142857 *5.589 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.589 ≈ let's compute 5.589 *0.07 is 0.39123, and 5.589 *0.00142857 ≈ approximately 0.00799. So total is about 0.39922. So 2.7945 + 0.39922 ≈ 3.19372.

So adding 16.767 +3.19372 gives 19.9607 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right, because 3.5714 *5 is about 17.857, but 3.5714 *5.589 would be a bit more. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated m c². Because for the nucleus, the mass is 6 u, so E_rest is 6 *931.5 MeV, which is 5589 MeV, or 5.589 GeV. But wait, that's for a single nucleus. So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 *5.589 GeV.

Wait, so 3.5714 *5.589 GeV. Let me compute that accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714 × 5.589.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 × 5 = 17.857

3.5714 × 0.5 = 1.7857

3.5714 × 0.08 = 0.285712

3.5714 × 0.009 = 0.0321426

Adding these: 17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427

19.6427 + 0.285712 = 19.928412

19.928412 + 0.0321426 ≈ 19.9605546 GeV.

So approximately 19.96 GeV. But looking at the options, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait a second, my calculation gave around 19.96 GeV, which isn't any of the options exactly. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mass calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I need to account for more precise values. Let me check if the mass of Li-6 is exactly 6 u. Wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is a bit less than 6 u because when you form a nucleus, some mass is converted into binding energy. So the rest mass might actually be a bit less than 6 u.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the mass is 6 u. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass of Li-6. So the actual mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, let me check. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the isotope mix. But for Li-6, the exact mass is important.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of
