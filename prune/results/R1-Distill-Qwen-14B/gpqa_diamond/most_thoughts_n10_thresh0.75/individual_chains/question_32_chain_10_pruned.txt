Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons make a mass number of 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the energy of the RHIC when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic energy, so let me think. The total energy of a particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Wait, right. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that. Let me calculate beta first, which is v/c. Beta here is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is about 0.28. Wait, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is roughly 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, I should be precise. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1, correct. So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is its rest mass multiplied by c squared. But usually, when we're talking about energies in particle physics, we use the rest mass in GeV/c², so when multiplied by c², it's just GeV.

Wait, but I think in these calculations, we often just use the rest mass as m, and the energy is gamma * m c². But since the units are in Ge
