Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical calculations. Hmm, let's see.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so the initial mass is M, and the combined rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. That means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right?

So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Because momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, if fragment 1 (the more massive one) has momentum p, fragment 2 has momentum -p.

Let me denote the masses. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier is 2m. So the sum is m + 2m = 3m. The sum is 0.99 M, so 3m = 0.99 M. So m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Therefore, the two masses are m=0.33M and 2m=0.66M.

Wait, but the initial nucleus has rest mass M. So the sum after is 0.99 M, which is less than M. So the difference is 1% of M, which is 0.01 M. So that must be the mass converted into kinetic energy.

Now, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But when it fissions, the rest energy is 0.99 M c², so 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The total kinetic energy of the fragments is the energy difference, which is 3 GeV. But wait, that's the total kinetic energy, right? Because energy is conserved.

Wait, but I have to be careful. The initial energy is all rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the fragments have rest energies (0.33
