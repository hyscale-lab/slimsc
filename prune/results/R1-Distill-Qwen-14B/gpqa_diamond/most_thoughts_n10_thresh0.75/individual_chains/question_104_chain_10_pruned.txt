Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

The question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )) )^(1/1) )? Hmm, maybe I should think of a simpler relation. Alternatively, I remember that for a given star mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period P and the mass of the planet. Or perhaps it's more about the star's velocity amplitude.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 + (M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e is zero for circular orbits, that term goes away. Also, since the planet is much less massive than the star (Neptune is way smaller than the Sun), M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. And M_p is the same for both planets as they are similar to Neptune. And the stars have the same mass as the Sun. So sin i is about 1 because we're detecting the planets, so their orbits are likely edge-on.

So K simplifies to (G * M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π P^(1/3)) ) )? Wait no, let me get the formula correct. Another approach: The radial velocity semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = ( (P * G )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π) ) ) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, perhaps K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3) or something like that.

Wait, let's think about the formula.
