Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet tugs the star, it causes the star to move towards or away from us, which shifts the spectral lines. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, I think.

The problem states that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the planets have similar masses, and their host stars are identical. The RV method detected shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship here. I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters. The formula I think is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 day in seconds) )) )... Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), but since the stars are the same mass and the planets are similar, maybe sin i is similar? Or not, but the problem doesn't mention inclination, so perhaps we can assume it's the same for both, so sin i cancels out.

Wait, the problem says the planets are detected, implying that the inclination isn't exactly edge-on, but the RV method is more sensitive when the orbit is edge-on (sin i is 1). But since both are detected, maybe we can assume that sin i is the same for both, or perhaps it's negligible. Alternatively, since the question is about the orbital period ratio, perhaps the inclination and other factors cancel out.

Wait, the formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (21 m/s) * (M_p / M_jup) ) / ( (M_star / M_sun)^(1/3) * (P / year)^(1/3) ) ). Hmm, I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Or another way: K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ). Because the formula I'm recalling is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / c ), or something like that.

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV method relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula is:

K = ( (G * P)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2π) ) ) * (something else...), but perhaps it's better to consider the proportionality.

Since both stars have the same mass (M) and the planets have the same mass (m), and sin i is the same (assuming same inclination, which the problem doesn't say but perhaps it's the same for both), then the ratio of K1 to K2 would be inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods.

Wait, no, let me think again. K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ). So since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, that would mean that if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is larger than P1. Because if K increases, P increases. Let me go through the math.

Assume K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

But wait, let me write it correctly. Since K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is some constant (including M_p, M_star, etc., which are same for both). So K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So taking the cube of both sides, (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1) / (P1/P2) )? Wait no, let's rearrange.

Wait, from K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So, rearrange:

(P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2.

So, cube both sides:

P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, the ratio of the periods is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do it again. Let me write K1 and K2 in terms of their periods.

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)
Divide K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C /
