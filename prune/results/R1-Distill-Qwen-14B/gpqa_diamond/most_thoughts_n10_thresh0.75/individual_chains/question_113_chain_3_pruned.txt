Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, and I need to choose the right one based on the data provided.

Alright, let me start by breaking down each of the spectra.

First, the FTIR. The broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates O-H stretching, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak, often around 2500-3300, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but alcohols have a broad peak too. Or maybe an amine? No, that's usually in a different range. Another possibility is an ether, but ethers don't have strong O-H stretches. So probably either alcohol or carboxylic acid.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak often associated with carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated ketone or an aromatic ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but I'm not too sure. But in this case, since there's a 1700 peak, it's likely that there's a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or a ketone.

In the NMR, there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond somewhere, maybe in an alkene or in a conjugated system with the carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone that's part of a ring.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: the molecular ion could break into smaller fragments. 45 is the mass of, say, (CH3)2CO (acetone) which is 58, but maybe a different fragment. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a methyl group and a carbonyl. Wait, 45 is CH3CO-O- something? Or maybe the fragment is from a ketone, like (CH3)2CO would lose some parts? Or perhaps it's a CH2=CH-O- group. Alternatively, 45 could be something like (CH3)CO⁻ or similar.

Now, let's consider the possible molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to figure out which formula fits the data.

Starting with the IR: the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an -OH group. So the compound probably has an -OH. That would mean either options A, C, or D. Because B is C6H10
