Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's try to work through this step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ probably indicates an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR usually mean hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 peak is often a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds or something else. Wait, if it's a ketone or an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 1700. But 1650 can also be an ester or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching in an aromatic compound). But wait, another possibility: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. That could explain the 1650 peak if it's a conjugated double bond.

Now, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, so that suggests the presence of a double bond in the structure. So, maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring? But since the IR had a peak at 1650, which is around the region for C=C in alkenes, but also for conjugated carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond.

The mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment, like from a (CH3)2CO group (acetone) or maybe a ketone. Or wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, but that's more like 31 or something. Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment from a methyl ester or something. Let me think. The molecular ion
