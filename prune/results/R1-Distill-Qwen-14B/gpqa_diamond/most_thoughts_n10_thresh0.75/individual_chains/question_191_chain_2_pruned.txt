Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So it's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2)- group attached? Or wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the enyl group would be CH2-C(=CH2)-? No, wait the structure is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is at C2. So it's CH2-CH(CH2)-? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2- but the substituent is on C2. So it's actually a vinyl group attached via the middle carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)- something. Wait, perhaps I should draw it. So the cyclohexanone has at position 5 a group that's CH2-C(CH2) with a double bond? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond elsewhere. Maybe it's a cyclohexanone ring with a substituent that's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond? I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look up. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as allyl group attached at the middle carbon. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait no, that's not right. Let me think: the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2, but attached at the second carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is at position 2 of propene. So propene is CH2=CHCH3. So substituting at position 2 would be CH2=CH- where the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. So the group would be CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So it's CH2=C(CH2-) something?
