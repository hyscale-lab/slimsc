Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. Let me think about its atomic structure.

Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3. So, if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So it's Li-6. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes isotopes might have different numbers, but I think in this case, the question states X is Li with 3 neutrons, so yes, Li-6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. Now, I need to calculate the energy of the RHIC when it accelerates these nuclei to a speed of 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m_0 c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So given v = 0.96c, let me compute gamma first.

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m_0 c². The mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the atomic mass, but I have to be careful with units.

Wait, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass, but I should probably use the molar mass in grams per mole to find the mass in kilograms. Let me think. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 g/mol? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, lithium-6 is an isotope. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. Let me check that.

Wait, I think the exact value isn't provided, so perhaps I need to look it up, but since this is a thought process, I'll
