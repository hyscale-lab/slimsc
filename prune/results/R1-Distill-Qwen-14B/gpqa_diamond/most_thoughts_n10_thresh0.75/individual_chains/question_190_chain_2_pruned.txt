Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking me to arrange these nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. The options are 1 to 5, and I need to pick the correct order from the given choices.

Alright, first, what do I remember about nucleophilicity? I think it depends on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, that's protic. In protic solvents, the ability of a nucleophile to donate electrons is affected by how well it's solvated. Strongly solvated nucleophiles are less reactive because the solvent stabilizes them and makes them less available to attack.

So, the nucleophiles listed are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH-)
3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS-)

Wait, actually, wait. Methanol is CH3OH, which is a neutral molecule. The others are deprotonated, so they're anions. Wait, no: 1 is an alkoxide, 2 is hydroxide, 3 is propionate (the conjugate base of propionic acid), 4 is methanol (which is a weak acid, but in aqueous solution, I think it's neutral), and 5 is ethanethiolate, which is the conjugate base of ethanethiol (HSe-), which is a weak acid but stronger than water. 

Wait, but when in aqueous solution, the strength of the base would determine how much it's deprotonated. Methanol is a weak acid (pKa around 19.7), so in aq solution, it's mostly un-ionized. So as a nucleophile, it's less reactive because it's not the conjugate base. Wait, but in aqueous solution, the reactive form would be the deprotonated one. But for those that are not as strong bases, their nucleophilicity is lower.

Wait, maybe I should list the basicity of these nucleophiles because in a protic solvent, stronger bases are better nucleophiles. But wait, that's not entirely accurate because solvation plays a big role.

Let's think
