Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission depends on its temperature. Oh right, it's given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda is the same, then T is the same since lambda is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they calculated the luminosities based on black body radiation. So the luminosity of a star depends on its radius squared and its temperature to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, I can compare their luminosities using L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

From the problem, R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Now, since their peak wavelengths are the same, T1 must equal T2. Wait, but hold on. If the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

So substituting into the luminosity ratio, L1/L2 = (1.5 R2)² * (T1)^4 / (R2² * T2^4) ). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So it's (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is 2.25. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, because when calculating luminosity, if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength might shift due to Doppler effect. But wait, the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps that accounts for any Doppler shift. Or maybe it's irrelevant because the peak emission is at the same wavelength, so their rest wavelengths are the same. Hmm.

Wait, no, the peak emission is as observed. So if one star is moving, its observed peak wavelength would shift. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So that would mean that the Doppler shifts for both stars must result in the same observed wavelength. Therefore, maybe their rest wavelengths (i.e., their actual temperatures) are different. But the problem says the wavelengths at which stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, that's a key point.

Wait, if both stars have the same
