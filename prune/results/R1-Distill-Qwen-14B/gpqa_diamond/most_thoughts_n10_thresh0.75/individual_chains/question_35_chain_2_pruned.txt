Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors... Right, to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. But first, let me write out what the matrix A_y looks like.

S matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[i   0 ]

So A_y is c multiplied by S. So c = h/(4π), which is a constant. Therefore, A_y would be:

[ 0       -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[i*(h/(4π))   0      ]

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to factor out the constant c. Because, when finding eigenvalues, if the matrix is a multiple of another matrix, the eigenvalues are the multiple times the eigenvalues of the other matrix. So maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply by c.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The characteristic equation for S is det(S - λS I) = 0. Wait, no, more accurately, det(S - λ I) = 0.

The matrix S - λ I is:

[ -λ   -i ]
[ i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(-i) → λ² - (i * -i). Wait, i*(-i) is -i². i² is -1. So -i*(-i) would be i² which is -1. Wait, no, let me compute that correctly.

The determinant is (top left * bottom right) - (top right * bottom left).

So ( -λ * -λ ) = λ².

Top right is -i, bottom left is i. So (-i)*(i) = (-i)(i) = -i². i squared is -1, so this is -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of A_y (which is c*S) would be c*1 = c and c*(-1) = -c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't fit with c. Option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1. That doesn't seem to match either. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the S matrix. Oh wait, the S matrix is given as first row (0, -i), second
