Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

So, the setup is a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic field was initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin angular momentum S. For a spin 1/2 particle, the spin can be either up or down. But when a magnetic field is applied, the energy levels split, and the particle's state will be a superposition if the system is disturbed.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the particle's spin is aligned either up or down along Z. The magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy levels are proportional to Sz. The particle is in an eigenstate of Sz, right?

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly switched off from Z and turned on along Y. So the Hamiltonian of the system changes from H_initial to H_final. The initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu·B, which for Z direction is proportional to Sz. After the switch, H_final = -mu·B', which is in Y direction, so proportional to Sy.

Wait, but wait, I think the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is E = -mu·B. So when the field is along Z, the energy is -gamma B S_z. Similarly, when it's along Y, it's -gamma B S_y.

But when the system is in a state that's an eigenstate of one Hamiltonian, and then the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the particle remains in its initial state but now the Hamiltonian is different.

The initial state was an eigenstate of Sz, either up or down. So when the field is turned to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So the energy levels are now determined by Sy. Since the particle is in a state that's an eigenstate of Sz, it's a superposition of eigenstates of Sy.

In quantum mechanics, when the system is in a state that's a superposition of energy eigenstates, it will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values. So the expectation value of Sz will oscillate because the state will evolve with time.

The oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference between the states. So I think I need to compute the energy splitting in the new Hamiltonian and then find the transition frequency.

Let me think about the eigenvalues of Sy. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, wait, the units—gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), because mu (magnetic moment) is in units of J/T, and S is in units of ħ. So gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

So the energy levels for the new Hamiltonian would be E_+ = -mu * B * (1/2) and E_- = +mu * B * (1/2) because Sy has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian when the field is along Y is H = -mu · B_y. So H = -gamma B S_y.

Since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, the energy eigenvalues are E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * (1/2?) Wait, wait, no. Wait, S is in units of ħ. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix.

So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y. So the eigenvalues are E = ± (-gamma B (ħ/2) ) * 1/2? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it correctly.

The energy eigenvalues come from H = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y for spin 1/2 is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Therefore, the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues are E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2).

Wait, no, because H = - gamma B S_y. So substituting S_y = ħ/2 * σ_y, the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B * (± ħ/2). So the two energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) * 1? Or wait, I think I may have made a mistake here.

Wait, S is in units of ħ. So S_z for spin 1/2 has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). So for S_y, the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) as well. So H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is in Y direction, so H = -gamma B S_y.

So the eigenvalues for H are H = -gamma B [± (ħ/2)]. So the two energy levels are E_up = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) * (1) ? Wait, no. Let me calculate properly.

Wait, for S_y, the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1). So when H = - gamma B S_y, the eigenvalues are:

E_+ = -gamma B * (ħ/2) * (+1) = - gamma B ħ / 2

E_- = -gamma B * (ħ/2) * (-1) = + gamma B ħ / 2

So the energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (- gamma B ħ /2 ) - (gamma B ħ /2 ) ) = (-gamma B ħ /2 - gamma B ħ /2 ) = - gamma B ħ. Wait, no, the energy levels are -gamma B ħ/2 and + gamma B ħ/2. So the difference is ( + gamma B ħ/2 ) - ( - gamma B ħ/2 ) )= gamma B ħ.

Wait, that's a positive value. Hmm, but wait, the frequency comes from the energy difference over hbar.

So the oscillation frequency is given by (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ. Because the energy difference is ħ ω, so ω = (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ.

So let me compute (E_+ - E_-) = (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ. So the difference is gamma B ħ. So dividing by ħ, we get omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, for the spin-flip frequency, the energy difference is E_+ − E_-, which is (gamma B ħ/2) - (-gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the frequency is omega = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

But wait, the particle is initially in an eigenstate of Sz, which is not an eigenstate of Sy. So after the switch, the system is in a superposition of eigenstates of Sy, and thus will evolve in time with phases that cause transitions between the states.

The expectation value of Sz will oscillate because the state is a superposition of eigenstates with different energies. The frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between the states.

So the time evolution is given by the energy levels. The energy splitting is 2*(gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. When the field is along Y, the system's state is a combination of the Sy eigenstates. The expectation value of Sz in this state will oscillate with frequency omega = (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

But looking at the answer options, option B is gamma*B. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, when dealing with spin systems, the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma B. But in this case, are we considering the oscillation due to the spin precession in the magnetic field?

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillation frequency is indeed gamma B. Because the transition between the eigenstates of Sy will cause the expectation values to oscillate at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, since the magnetic field was along z, so the particle's spin was aligned along z, so it's in either eigenstate of Sz.

After the
