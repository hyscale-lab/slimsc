Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate... I remember that's PO4^3- right? So, the solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O. Both of these are phosphates, so I think they relate to the different protonation states of phosphoric acid, H3PO4.

Wait, so the given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. These are the dissociation steps. So H3PO4 can lose three protons, each with their own Ka values. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3).

The problem gives me 1.00 g of each salt in 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) of solution. So I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- ions in the solution.

Let me think about the salts. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4●2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4) * 2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of crystallization, but that probably doesn't affect the ion concentration much.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, I'm trying to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-? So this would be the third dissociation step. But the Ka3 is so small, 1.8e-12. So in solution, the concentration of PO4^3- from HPO4^2- is going to be really low. But wait, the solution also has H2PO4^-, which can deprotonate to HPO4^2- and so on.

But wait, in this scenario, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. How does that affect the speciation of phosphate ions?

I think this might form a buffer system. Because H2PO4^- is a weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. Wait, no, actually, H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4).
