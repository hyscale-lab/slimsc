Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction involves a different starting material and a different reagent, then the products are combined and analyzed by HPLC. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will see in the two types of HPLC columns.

First, I'll try to parse each reaction separately.

Reaction I:
The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reagent is LAH, followed by an acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which I remember is a strong reducing agent. It's typically used to reduce ketones and aldehydes. So in this reaction, the ketone group in hexan-3-one would be reduced.

Wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is like CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, wait—the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

The molecule is hexan-3-one, which is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the substituents—so the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So structure is: CH2CH2... Wait, let's number it.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(O) (the ketone)

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 (methoxy) attached to that carbon?

Wait, no, wait: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, but with substituents. So the structure is CH2CH2CO in the middle, but with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one:

Positions 1 to 6.

Carbon 3 is the ketone (O). So, carbons would be:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O-

4: CH2-
