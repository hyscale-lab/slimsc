Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different compounds from the list.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. Chiral centers have four different substituents. So, if a molecule has at least one chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism, which means it has enantiomers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Wait, the groups are on each benzene ring. The molecule is a dimethyl ester of a dinitro compound. Now, do the substituents make any of the carbons chiral? The central biphenyl structure: each ring has substituents. But the carbons where the rings are connected are the ones in the middle. Are they chiral? Let me visualize. The biphenyl's central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) would have two phenyl groups attached. Wait, no—actually, each benzene is attached to a carbon that's part of the central chain. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, it's 1,1'-biphenyl, so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position of each. So each benzene is attached via a single bond to a central carbon, perhaps. Wait, no—biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond between their 1 positions. So the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene, and 6 and 6' on each. So, the question is, are any of the carbons in this molecule chiral? The central carbon where the two benzene rings are attached is connected to two phenyl groups, but wait, the structure might be that each benzene is connected to a central carbon which is attached to other groups. Or maybe the central carbon is part of a chain. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the substituents. The compound is dimethyl, which suggests ester groups. So, each ester is probably at the 2 and 2' positions on each benzene ring. Each of these ester groups is a methyl ester. So, the structure would have the two benzene rings connected, and each has a COOCH3 group in position 2 and a nitro group in position 6. So, the question is, do any of these substituents create a chiral center?

Each of the ester groups is a carbonyl group attached to OMe. The carbonyl is at position 2 on each benzene. But wait, the carbons attached to the ester groups—are they chiral? For example, the carbon attached to the ester O would have other substituents. Let's imagine the benzene ring: at position 2, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3 (the ester). The positions around the benzene are arranged in a way that for the 2-position substituent, does the carbon (like the one attached to the benzene) have four different groups? Wait, no—because in aromatic rings, the carbons are sp2 hybridized and have double bonds, so they can't be chiral centers. So, the carbons attached to the substituents (like the ester) are part of the benzene ring and thus sp2 hybridized, so they can't be chiral. Therefore, the molecule as a whole can't have any chiral centers. Wait, but wait! Is there a possibility of some other chiral centers elsewhere? Like in the ester groups themselves. The ester group is OMe attached to a carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to the oxygen, which is connected to the benzene. But the carbonyl is in the ester: R-O-CO-O-R. The carbonyl group (carbon) is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's sp2 hybridized and can't be a chiral center either.

Wait, but maybe the biphenyl structure has some kind of stereogenic centers. Oh, wait, the biphenyl rings can have different substituents. Because the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the central bond. So, the question is, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, then it might not have a chiral center. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each benzene are mirrored, then the molecule would be achiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, then maybe the molecule could be chiral. So, in the case of 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate groups, the substituents on each benzene are the same as their counterparts. So, the structure would have a plane of symmetry in the center, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. If the substituents on each benzene are symmetric, then the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. So, compound 1 is symmetrical, so it doesn't have optical isomers. So, no chiral centers in this molecule.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The formula is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CHOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon, the one attached to the OH, the CH2COOCH3 group, and two CH2 groups? Wait, wait, the structure is: the propanoate ester. Let me write it as COOCH3 attached to a CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. The structure is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO— but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the structure is: COOCH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the chain is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO—, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, the carbon chain: the carboxylic acid is at the end. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to COOCH3 and Carbon 3 (CH2OH).

Wait, no. Let me structure it correctly. The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-OCH3.

So, the chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

The carboxylic acid is at the end. So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the three carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure step by step. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH.

So, the ester form would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the carbon atoms: the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two CH2 groups perhaps?

Wait, no— carbon chain is:

The second carbon is CH2(OH), which is connected to a CH2 group on one side and the COOCH3 on the other. Wait, no: the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- an OH group,

- two CH2 groups (the one on the left is CH2(OH), which is connected to a CH3? Wait, no, no. Let me get this right. Wait, in propanoate, there are three carbons. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be, because that would have three carbons as:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2

3: COOCH3.

Wait, that's only three, but that's not a propanoate. Hmm, maybe I should draw it as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the three carbons in the propanoate are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2(OH).

So, the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, that can't be because that's four carbons. No, wait, propanoate has three carbons. So, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and another CH2.

Carbon 3: CH2(OH).

Wait, that would make the chain as CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, right? So, Carbon 2 is CH2 connected to Carbon 1 (COOCH3) and Carbon 3 (CH2OH). So, the second carbon has four substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and the COOCH3?

Wait no, each carbon can only have four bonds. So, Carbon 2 in this structure has:

- a single bond to Carbon 1 (COOCH3),

- a single bond to Carbon 3 (CH2OH),

- and two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Carbon 2 is CH2, which would have two CH2 groups attached? No, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Let's think of it as the middle carbon (Carbon 2) has:

- a bond to Carbon 1 (COOCH3),

- a bond to Carbon 3 (CH2OH),

- and two hydrogens.

So, the substituents on Carbon 2 are: COOCH3, CH2OH, and two H's. So, that's only three different groups. Wait, no: substituents are:

- COOCH3 group,

- CH2OH group,

- and two H's.

So, same substituents (two H's). So, the four substituents on the carbon are: COOCH3, CH2OH, H, H. So, two substituents are the same (H), so this can't be a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I'm wrong. Because in the molecule, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- a COOCH3 group,

- a CH2OH group,

- and two CH2 groups? No, not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that Carbon 2 is connected to:

- the COOCH3 group,

- the OH group,

- and two CH2 groups. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3CH(OH)COOH.

As an ester, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- a CH3 group,

- a COOCH3 group,

- an OH group,

- and another CH group (the adjacent carbon). Wait no, the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because propanoate has three carbons. So, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the middle carbon (Carbon 2) has:

- a CH3 group,

- an OH group,

- a COOCH3 group,

- and a CH (to Carbon 3, which is the COOCH3).

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- an OH group,

- and a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH(OH), so its substituents are:

- CH3 (from Carbon 1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 3),

- and another substituent, which would be a hydrogen? 

Wait, no, because the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (the CH(OH) one) is connected to:

- a CH3 group,

- an OH group,

- a COOCH3 group,

- and a CH (to the next carbon).

Wait, no, because in the structure, Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and has an OH and a hydrogen. Wait, no, Carbon 2 would have four substituents: two from the adjacent carbons, an OH, and a hydrogen. Let me count:

Carbon 2:

- connected to Carbon 1 (CH3),

- connected to Carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- has an -OH group,

- and a hydrogen.

So, substituents are: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. All four are different. So, this carbon has four different groups attached. That would make it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Does the structure actually have a chiral center? Let's think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The middle carbon (C2) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another substituent, which is the adjacent carbon (C3, which is the COOCH3). Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (CH3), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and has an OH and a hydrogen. So, the substituents are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All four are different, so yes, that's a chiral center. So, compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Hmm, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the structure incorrectly. So, the correct analysis is that compound 2 does have a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, right? The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. So, the carbonyl group is attached to two phenyl groups. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O, so it's sp2 hybridized and can't be a chiral center. Are there any other chiral centers in the molecule? The phenyl groups are symmetrical. So, the molecule benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When it forms dimethyl ester, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans form. So, the dimethyl ester would be:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans-diepoxy ester. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But in trans configuration. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, the question is, does this compound have any chiral centers? Well, the central double bond has substituents on each carbon. Each carbon of the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group from the ester. Wait, no, wait: in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
       \
C=C
       /
COOCH3

Wait, no, the actual structure is that each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is actually:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure correctly. Fumarate is the trans diacid: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the substituents on opposite sides. So, the ester is dimethyl fumarate, which would be (MeO)OC-CH=CH-CO(O)Me. So, each COOCH3 is attached to each end of the double bond. The configuration is trans because it's fumarate (not maleate, which is cis). Now, the question is, does this structure have any chiral centers?

Each of the double bond carbons (the two CH groups) is connected to a COOCH3 group and another substituent. Wait, each of those carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3 group,

- a hydrogen,

- and two other groups... Wait, no, in the structure, each of the double bond carbons is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- and another substituent. Wait, no, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But that can't be, because each double bond carbon would have two substituents. Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, the structure would be:

      O
      ||
O-C-OCH3
      \
       C=C
      /
O-C-OCH3

So, each of the two double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, but then each has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. But double bonds in alkenes have two substituents on each carbon. So, each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen, and the other two bonds are part of the double bond. So, each carbon has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two double bonds (each to the adjacent carbons). Thus, each of the double bond carbons has two substituents and two double bonds. So, each has two substituents (COOCH3 and H), but that's it. So, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to three other atoms: two in the double bond and one substituent. Wait, no, each carbon in a double bond is bonded to three atoms (two in the double bond and one substituent). So, in this case, each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two double bonds (so, each is part of the double bond, connected to the adjacent carbon).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is, do any of the carbons have four different substituents? The double bond carbons have groups: COOCH3, H, and two double bonds to each other. So, the substituents are:

Each double bond carbon has COOCH3, H, and two bonds to the other carbon.

Wait, that's three substituents. So, each has two substituents (COOCH3 and H) plus the two bonds in the double bond. So, each has only two substituents, not four. Therefore, neither of the double bond carbons is a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, but wait— does it have any other chiral centers elsewhere? The ester groups are connected via the double bond. So, the rest of the molecule is just the ester groups; the central double bond doesn't contribute to chiral centers. So, compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, am I sure? Because sometimes when there's a double bond with substituents on either side, you can get geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about chiral centers, not double bonds.

Wait, but wait another thought: wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. But does that affect the presence of chiral centers? No, because the double bond itself isn't a chiral center. So, no. So, compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I've heard that some esters can have chiral centers elsewhere. Let me double-check. Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-? No, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So, the structure is E, but that doesn't create any chiral centers. The only way a double bond can lead to optical isomerism is if it's part of a stereogenic element, but that's not the case here. So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, no! Wait, another possibility. The two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Does that symmetry affect the possibility of the molecule being chiral? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. So, if both ester groups are on opposite sides, does that make the molecule symmetrical? Let me imagine the structure. Each ester group is on opposite sides. So, the molecule would have a center of symmetry? Let me think: if you rotate 180 degrees, the structure remains the same. So, it's symmetrical along the double bond. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I thought that in some cases, such as when the substituents are different, the molecule might be chiral. But in this case, since both substituents on each double bond carbon are the same (COOCH3 and H on each), but wait, no. Because each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a H, and the other substituents are the double bonds. So, each double bond carbon has two substituents, but they are both same (COOCH3 and H). Wait, but each double bond carbon has COOCH3 and H. Are these groups identical on both carbons? No, because each is attached to a different carbon. Wait, no, the two COOCH3 groups are across from each other. So, the two double bond carbons are each attached to a COOCH3 and a H, and the double bond. Therefore, each of their substituents is the same as the other's. So, the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: can the molecule be superimposed on its mirror image? In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetrical, so it's identical to its mirror image. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomers. So, no.

So, summarizing:

Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Yes, it has a chiral center.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check compound 4. Oh! Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But is there any possibility that the molecule itself could have a chiral center elsewhere? For example, are the ester groups attached to a chiral center?

Wait, the ester groups are attached to the double bond's carbons, which are each connected to two substituents. So, the carbons in the ester groups (like OCH3) are attached to the carbonyl, which is not a chiral center. So, no, the ester groups themselves don't contribute to any chiral centers. So, no.

So, from the four compounds, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But wait, looking back at the options, let's see. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. None of the others do. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Option A includes 1 and 4 as well, which I think don't have optical isomerism. Option D includes 1 and 2. So, if I'm correct that only 2 does, but none of the options account for that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (E)-Ph-CH₂-CH₂-Ph, but no, wait, it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, no. The structure is actually CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but with the substituents on opposite sides. Wait, no. Fumarate is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH in maleic acid, but in fumarate, it's the trans isomer. So, the structure is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH, with the COOH groups on opposite sides.

When esterified, it becomes (MeO)OC-CH=CH-CO(O)Me. So, each of the double bond carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group. Wait, but wait, I'm getting this wrong. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is trans. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

      COOCH3
       \    /
        C=C
       /    \
      COOCH3

In the trans configuration. Now, the question is, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The double bond is in the center, but each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each double bond carbon has two identical substituents (COOCH3) and two bonds in the double bond. So, substituents are:

Each double bond carbon:

- COOCH3,

- COOCH3,

- and two bonds to the other carbon.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon is bonded to:

- two COOCH3 groups,

- and two bonds in the double bond.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply each double bond carbon is connected to four substituents, which isn't the case. Each double bond carbon is connected to two substituents (the ester groups) and two other carbons (the double bond). So, each has two substituents, not four. Thus, no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a chiral molecule. Because if the molecule is symmetrical, then it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no. So, back to the options. The available options are A, B, C, D. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

According to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1.

Wait, let's go back to compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, the structure is a biphenyl ring connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (OCH3) at position 2.

So, on each benzene ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. The question is, are there any chiral centers in this structure?

The biphenyl rings are connected via the 1 position, which is a single bond. So, the central bond allows for rotation. Therefore, the substituents on each ring can be arranged in a way that creates asymmetry.

But wait, the substituents on each ring are symmetrical. Each ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. So, the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. But how does that affect the overall molecule? Let me imagine the biphenyl structure: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring has a nitro and a ester group. Now, if the rings are arranged such that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides, the molecule's symmetry can change.

Wait, but the molecule as a whole may have a plane of symmetry. If the two rings are mirror images of each other, then the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry because the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are symmetric positions. So, the molecule would be achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, then only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option with only 2. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, and it's a trans-diepoxide. Wait, no, fumarate is a trans-diacid. So, when esterified, it becomes dimethyl fumarate, which is also trans. Now, does this structure have any chiral centers? No, because each double bond carbon is connected to two identical substituents (the ester groups). So, each has two substituents, which are the same. Therefore, no chiral centers.

Wait, wait a moment. Another possibility: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it's achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate, being trans, has a center of symmetry. So, it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. If only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but none of the options have that, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option B: 3,4

Option C: 2,3

Option D:1,2

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, which is a type of stereoisomer, but not necessarily optical isomerism. So, perhaps it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again about compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The middle carbon (CH(OH)) has substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, four different groups. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So, yes, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 1. Let's think again. Compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Now, the biphenyl structure can have different diastereomers, but does it have any chiral centers?

Hmm, perhaps the biphenyl structure itself can be chiral if the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. For example, if the substituents are not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring has two substituents. If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, in a biphenyl structure, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other on the benzene ring. So, the substituents on each ring are opposite each other. Therefore, the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry (since each ring's substituents are opposite each other and the two rings are connected in the same way), making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but none of the options include that. So, perhaps I'm missing something, or perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether any of the compounds are meso compounds. For example, in some cases, a molecule can have multiple chiral centers but be achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

But for compound 2, it's a single chiral center, so it's not a meso compound. So, it must be chiral.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

None of these options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that compound 2 has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine compound 2. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH group (no, wait, no). Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the middle carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- a CH3 group,

- a COOCH3 group,

- an OH group,

- and a hydrogen?

Wait, no. The structure is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,

- Carbon 3: COOCH3,

- an OH group,

- and a hydrogen.

So, four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. All four are different. So, yes, it's a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 does. But none of the options have only 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing another compound.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The two rings are connected at position 1. Now, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. So, on each ring, they are opposite each other. So, the molecule as a whole has a center of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. The only way for the answer to fit the options is if I made a mistake in considering another compound. For example, perhaps dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, if the substituents on the double bond are different, the molecule can have a chiral center elsewhere. But in this case, the substituents on each double bond carbon are both COOCH3 groups. So, no, they are identical.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical due to the substituents. For example, if the double bond has two different groups on each carbon, but in this case, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Maybe it has a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is (E)-COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but that's not correct. No, it's (E)-COOCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might be symmetrical. So, it's not chiral.

Therefore, I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate. Maybe it's actually a chiral compound. How?

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical. Let me draw it.

Structure of dimethyl fumarate: the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule is:

COOCH3
    \   
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But this structure is planar, and the two ester groups are on opposite sides, creating a plane of symmetry. So, no chiral centers.

Wait, but perhaps there's a chiral center elsewhere. No, the ester groups are on the double bond carbons, which are each bonded to two substituents (COOCH3 and H). So, no.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Since according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism instead of optical isomerism. No, the question specifies optical isomerism, which is about chirality.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one of the other compounds does have a chiral center, and I missed it.

Looking back at compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Is there any possibility that the molecule has a chiral center? I don't think so. Because each of the double bond carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups), so no chiral centers.

Compound 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. No chiral centers.

So, the only compound is 2.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the question is misprinted or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me consider the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, I think I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but with the substituents on opposite sides (trans configuration). So, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

In the trans configuration. Now, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each has two identical substituents, so no chiral centers.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

Option A includes 1,2,4.

Option D includes 1 and 2.

So, according to my analysis, if only 2 is correct, but it's not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is two benzene rings connected via a single bond. Each has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2.

Now, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So, each ring is symmetric. The entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Unless the substituents are arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. For example, if the substituents on the two rings are on the same side, but I don't think that's possible because the rings are connected by a single bond, which allows free rotation. So, the molecule can rotate, so any arrangement would be able to find a mirror image, making it achiral.

So, no optical isomerism in compound 1.

Thus, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 is a diastereomer but not a chiral compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 2. Let me think about its structure again.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- H.

So, four different groups. Thus, it's a chiral center, so optical isomerism exists.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) if I made a mistake in thinking that compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

But I don't think so. I'm confident that compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no.

Thus, I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, that's not right. The correct structure is (E)-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3), but that's not possible because that would require each carbon to have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible. No, the correct structure is CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3 in the trans configuration. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be. The correct structure is actually (E)-CH₂=C(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. No, that would require each double bond carbon to have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as O=C-OCH3 on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH=CH group, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration. So, each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. So, each has two substituents, not four. Thus, no chiral centers.

Therefore, I'm confident that compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, the only compound that has optical isomerism is 2. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 1. Let me think one last time.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The connection is at position 1.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. For example, if the substituents are on the same face of the biphenyl, the molecule could be chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry.

But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are symmetric positions. So, the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral.

Therefore, no optical isomerism in compound 1.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 also has optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate exists in a cis configuration, which would make it a meso compound. But no, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is not a meso compound. The cis isomer would be a meso compound if it has a plane of symmetry. So, in the cis isomer (dimethyl maleate), the substituents are on the same side, making it a meso compound (thus, achiral). But in the trans isomer, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical and achiral.

So, in conclusion, I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, including 1, 2, and 4. But I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in considering the structure of compound 4. Let me check the formula of dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid with methanol. Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. The ester would replace the -OH of each COOH with OCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3

In the trans configuration. So, the molecule is symmetric, so no chiral centers.

Thus, I think the correct answer is that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about geometric isomerism, but no, the question specifically mentions optical isomerism.

Given all this, I think the intended correct answer is option A, which includes 2. But I'm not entirely confident.


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has at least one chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and ester groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings and the plane of symmetry along the central bond. Therefore, it does not have any chiral centers and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different substituents: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-CO-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH=C(COOCH₃)₂. The double bond carbons are each bonded to two identical substituents (COOCH₃ groups), so they are not chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest match to the reasoning is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, though compound 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
