Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. The setup is that the researcher introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when testing the expression, the protein isn't showing up as expected. 

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand. Let me see... Oh wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good because that's where translation begins. So the first codon is methionine, which is correct for the start.

Now, the problem must be somewhere else. One of the options mentions a missense mutation in the antigenic determinant. Hmm, the hemagglutinin tag is at the N-terminus, so the first few codons would code for that. If there's a mutation, maybe a stop codon or a wrong amino acid, that could mess up the protein. But wait, the sequence provided doesn't show a stop codon in the early part. Let me check the first few codons.

ATG is Met. Next is TAC, which is Tyr. Then CC, so ACC is Thr. Then ATG is another Met. Wait, no, the sequence is ATGTACCCATACGATGTT... Let me break it into triplets starting from ATG.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... So after Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Pro, etc. Wait, the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. Fourth is CCA (Pro). Fifth is TAC (Tyr again). Hmm, so the first part is Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val... So the HA tag is probably the beginning. If there's a mutation, perhaps in the HA sequence, but the provided sequence doesn't show any obvious stop codons early on. But the issue isn't about the HA tag—maybe it's about the terminator?

Wait, looking further down, I see TGA in the middle. Let me check where that is. Let me count the letters. Let me see: the first part is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ... So after ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA. So the 11th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, that's in the middle. So the DNA sequence has a TGA codon, which is a stop codon, positioned after the HA tag.

Wait, but wait a second—the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the construct is meant to have the HA tag followed by GADD
