Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I have the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and four options to choose from.

First, I need to determine what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have an ester reacting with H-I and red phosphorus, it usually leads to the cleavage of the ester into an acid and an alcohol. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's more about elimination or substitution? Hmm, I might need to think more about that.

Let me look at the data. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, likely indicating O-H stretch. But wait, that's a broad region. But wait, no, that's a wide area. O-H stretch in acids is usually broad and around 2500-3300. Maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which is usually a carbonyl group (C=O). So if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone, or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 peak is more indicative of an ester or a ketone. Carboxylic acids usually have a broader O-H stretch around 2500-3300, and their carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a bit lower. Wait, the IR data also includes 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad peak, but could it be at 10.5? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, but the integration is 1H. Or perhaps an acidic proton like in a phenol? But phenols usually are around 5-7 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe an alpha proton to a carbonyl group? Like in an ester or ketone?

Wait, the initial IR peak at 3400-2500 cm-1 is a broad range. Could that be an O-H stretch? If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad. But if it's an ester, maybe it's an alcohol's O-H? Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are used in the reaction. Oh, wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Because when you treat an ester with HI and red
