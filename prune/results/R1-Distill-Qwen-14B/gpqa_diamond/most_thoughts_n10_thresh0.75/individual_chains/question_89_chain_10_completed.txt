Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. Finally, I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, let me think about the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and dibromination at 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so when dibromides react with bases, they often undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming alkenes. So, I think this is an E2 elimination, where two bromides are removed, and a double bond forms.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, because 1 and 3 positions on adamantane are actually not adjacent. Let me visualize the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected in a way similar to a diamond. If the bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, which are across from each other, maybe in the same ring? Or perhaps in adjacent rings. Hmm, maybe the elimination leads to forming a bridge or something else.

Wait, when you eliminate two bromides from adjacent carbons, you form a double bond. But in this case, the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, but wait, no, that's when the two leaving groups are on adjacent carbons. So if the two bromines are on 1 and 3, maybe the elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, where each bromide leaves, and each forms a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann elimination, but that's for cyclic esters. No, that's not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diene. Because if two E2 reactions happen, each removing a bromide and forming a double bond. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so when each Br leaves, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, leading to a diene structure.

Wait, but the product when treated with KOH is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be adjacent to a carbonyl, like an -OCH2- group. Hmm, wait, but if the product after KOH is a ketone, maybe the structure is an adamantane with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a ketone. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is more about amines. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably an -OCH2- group because that region is typical for such groups. Then, the 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group near an electronegative group or something else. But wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, with an adjacent oxygenated group.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double dehydrohalogenation leading to an epoxide? No, because epoxides have different NMR and IR. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but under basic conditions, elimination is more likely than substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone. How? If two bromides are on adjacent carbons, their elimination would form a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe when two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, the base can abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, perhaps the structure of adamantane has the Brs on adjacent carbons in a way that elimination can form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that dehydrohalogenation leads to a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But since the starting material is a dihalide, perhaps it's undergoing a double substitution, but that's less likely because bases usually induce elimination in vicinal dihalides. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide. So maybe elimination isn't possible, leading me to think about something else.

Wait, another approach: The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely a ketone. So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and the product is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. How?

I think maybe the KOH is causing an oxidation. Wait, no, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the bromides are in positions that, upon elimination, form a carbonyl. Wait, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, and each elimination leads to a double bond, but perhaps the two eliminations create a conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that two eliminations lead to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation where each Br leaves, and a double bond forms, but with the structure of adamantane, perhaps the two double bonds form a bridge, leading to a ketone. Hmm, maybe that's the case. Let me think: If you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, you might form an exo-cyclic double bond, but how that leads to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated dienone. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the product 1 is a diepoxide? No, because then the IR would show epoxide signals.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, undergoes a double E2 elimination, each eliminating HBr and forming a double bond. But since the starting material isn't a vicinal dihalide, maybe the elimination is not possible, leading me to think perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is not vicinal, but perhaps the structure allows for an elimination to form a bridgehead double bond. For example, in norbornene systems, bridgehead double bonds are possible. So, when KOH is added, the two Brs on 1 and 3 (which are bridge positions) could eliminate, forming a bridgehead double bond. But then, where is the carbonyl group coming from?

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think: when a dihalide undergoes double elimination, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but in a way that another group becomes a carbonyl. Oh, maybe if the structure after elimination leads to a ring contraction, creating a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But the NMR doesn't show multiple carbonyl signals.

Wait, another angle: The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where an OCH2 group would appear. So, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. But then, the IR would have a peak around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the epoxide. But the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a ketone.

So perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent ether group. Wait, but how would that form from a dihalide?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then under basic conditions undergoes some ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the first step is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a bridged bicyclic compound with a carbonyl. For example, in adamantane, losing two HBr would form a bridge, creating a ketone. Suppose the structure becomes something like a bicyclic ketone.

Another approach: The product 1 has a 1H NMR with a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) and other signals. The triplet at 4.79 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2. So perhaps the structure is a diol? But KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution. Wait, but in some cases, dihalides can undergo substitution if the leaving groups are in a position that allows a good transition state.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a glycol, but I'm not sure. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so not a diol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the two Brs are replaced by hydroxide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would react with KOH to form 1,3-diol adamantane. But then, the product would be a diol, and the IR would show O-H stretches, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial thought about elimination is correct. Let me think about the product 1 being a ketone. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via E2 mechanisms, forming a double bond. Wait, but if the two Br are on positions that allow for each to eliminate, perhaps the structure becomes a diene. But then, how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a conjugated diene, and then under basic conditions, some further reaction occurs. Oh, wait, but KOH is present. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is formed, and then it undergoes some oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for a reaction where a dihalide becomes a ketone. I remember that pinacol rearrangement involves a diol losing water to form a ketone, but that's under acid conditions. Alternatively, the Clemmensen reduction is for ketones to alkanes, but that's with Zn(Hg)/HCl. No, not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: The reaction of a dihalide with a strong base can sometimes lead to the formation of an epoxide if the base is something like NaOH and water, but here it's KOH, which is a strong base. Or perhaps, in the presence of excess KOH, the dihalide could undergo a substitution to form an oxide. Wait, but in that case, the product would be a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double E2 elimination, leading to a diene. But then, how does that relate to the product being a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is such that elimination leads to a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating each would leave a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when two Brs are removed, the adjacent carbons form a double bond, but with the structure leading to a carbonyl group. For example, if two adjacent bridgehead carbons lose HBr, each forming a double bond, but in a way that creates a six-membered ring with a carbonyl. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricyclic compound with a carbonyl. Once I figure out product 1, I can proceed.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, the next step is treating it with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But the starting material here is a ketone, so perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or some kind of acetal/ketal.

Wait, wait. Another reaction comes to mind: the formation of an acetal from a ketone. To form an acetal, you typically need a diol and acid catalyst. But aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can act as a catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is treated with a diol in presence of a Lewis acid to form an acetal.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, and we're using aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, and I don't think adamantane is aromatic. So that might not be the case.

Another possibility: Maybe the ketone reacts with aluminum isopropoxide to form an enol. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and when treated with Al(iPr)3, it undergoes some kind of ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it forms a hemiacetal or acetal.

Wait, considering the reagents, perhaps product 2 is an acetal. So, if product 1 is a ketone, product 2 would be an acetal, which is more reactive.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

Wait, but in this case, the ozonolysis is done on product 2. If product 2 is an acetal, which typically doesn't have double bonds (acetals have single bonds), then perhaps product 2 has a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, maybe during the formation of product 2, a double bond is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide, product 1 (a ketone) is converted into an enol ether or something with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
IR: 1720 cm-1 (C=O)
NMR: 4.79 (2H, perhaps OCH2), 2.41-2.23 (10H, perhaps CH2 groups in adamantane), 1.94 (2H, maybe another CH2 group)

So product 1 is a ketone with an OCH2 group. So perhaps the structure is a ketone where the carbonyl is connected to an OCH2 group, which is attached to the adamantane structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-O-... but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is part of the adamantane, and the OCH2 is a substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the product is a secondary alcohol that oxidizes to a ketone, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a carbonyl group through some other mechanism. I'm a bit stuck here, but for the sake of moving forward, let's assume that product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent OCH2 group.

Moving to step 2: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which can help in the formation of enol ethers or other such compounds. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the formation of a Grignard-like reagent, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be the formation of a ketal from a ketone. To form a ketal, the ketone reacts with a diol in acidic conditions. But aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid and can act as a catalyst. So, perhaps product 1 (the ketone) reacts with a diol (like ethylene glycol) in the presence of Al(iPr)3 to form a ketal. The diol would be in excess, so the product would be the corresponding ketal.

So, product 2 would be a ketal, which would have a structure where the carbonyl is converted into an O-R-CH2-O-R group. But wait, the diol would supply the two -OH groups, which would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an acetal.

But then, the product 2 would have a CH2 group between two oxygen atoms, making an acetal. So, the next step is ozonolysis on product 2.

Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. But acetals are typically without double bonds. Wait, so maybe product 2 has a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: When product 1 is reacted with aluminum isopropoxide, maybe it's undergoing some kind of elimination to form an alkene, perhaps via an E1 or E2 mechanism, or maybe via a conjugate elimination.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. If you heat a ketone with a strong Lewis acid, perhaps it can undergo some kind of elimination, such as the formation of an enol. But enols are generally not isolated; they tautomerize to ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid catalyzes the formation of an enol ether by removing a proton adjacent to the carbonyl, forming a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(iPr)3, it undergoes an elimination to form an enol ether. So the OCH2 group would be adjacent to a CH2, which upon elimination would form a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond that is part of an enol ether structure.

So, product 2 would have a structure like:

O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-..., but with a double bond formed by elimination. Wait, perhaps after elimination, it becomes O=C-CH2-CH2-O-..., but that doesn't form a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure becomes something where a double bond is formed between the OCH2 group and another carbon. For example, after elimination, you might get a CH2-O-CH2-CH2 group, but with a double bond between the CH2 and O. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated enol ether. Let me imagine product 1 as a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O- group. Then, when Al(iPr)3 is added, it may deprotonate a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl, leading to the formation of an enol. But in an enol, the double bond is between the carbonyl carbon and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, that makes sense. So, product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with a strong Lewis acid, it forms an enol. The enol would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. But wait, the IR of product 1 is 1720 cm-1 for the carbonyl, so if product 2 is an enol, the IR would show a different carbonyl peak. Or maybe not, since enols are in equilibrium with ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid catalyzes the formation of a conjugated diene from product 1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If product 1 has an OCH2CH2 group and a ketone, then upon elimination, it could form a double bond between the OCH2 and another CH2 group, making an enol ether. So product 2 would have a structure like O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the OCH2 and the next CH2, making it O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2. But wait, that would require the presence of a hydrogen on the OCH2 group, which can be abstracted by the Lewis acid, leading to elimination.

If that's the case, product 2 would have an enol ether structure with a double bond. Then, when ozonolysis is performed on product 2, the double bond would be cleaved.

Ozonolysis of an enol ether (like an allyl ether) would typically break the double bond and form carbonyl groups. For example, ozonolysis of CH2=CH-O-R would give two carbonyl compounds: one from each end.

So, in product 3, which is the ozonolysis product, we'd have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. But in this scenario, the ozonolysis would generate two carbonyl groups, perhaps.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded hydrogens are typically those near electronegative atoms or in an environment with lower electron density, like being adjacent to carbonyl groups.

In an ozonolysis product, after breaking a double bond, each carbonyl group is typically at the end of a chain. So, the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded.

Wait, but ozone tends to cleave double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond in the structure (like an enol ether), ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls. For example, if product 2 is O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but that's without a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between OCH2 and CH2. So, O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 would have a double bond between the OCH2 and the adjacent CH2, making it O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 → O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2. No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between CH2 and CH2, which isn't possible without another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a structure where the enol ether is part of a longer chain, such as O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH3, but without a double bond.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about what happens after ozonolysis.

Ozonolysis of a double bond generally breaks it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, ozonolysis would form two carbonyls, one on each side.

In product 3, after ozonolysis and workup, each carbonyl would be at the end of a chain. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, each of these would be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, but how would that affect the coupling? Let's think: if the hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl, it's probably a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, which would be split by neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, but let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 has a double bond, say, between carbons A and B. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, perhaps. So, each fragment would have a carbonyl group at the end.

For example, if product 2 is CH2=CH-O-R, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, like O=C-R-O-CH2 and O=C-CH2-O-R? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the ozonolysis of an enol ether (like CH2=CH-O-R) would produce two carbonyl compounds. The reaction typically occurs by cleavage of the double bond, adding O3, and then breaking with a reductant like dimethyl sulfide. So for CH2=CH-O-R, ozonolysis would yield formaldehyde and R-O-CHO, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2 would give two formaldehyde molecules. For a more complex structure, say, R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R, if there's a double bond in the chain, like R-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R with a double bond between the middle CH2 groups, then ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a structure where the double bond is between two CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen. So, after ozonolysis, each of those CH2 groups becomes a carbonyl group.

So, in product 3, the structure would have two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH2 group. The hydrogens on those CH2 groups would be split by neighboring protons, leading to a coupling pattern.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be near a carbonyl. So, those hydrogens would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

In such a case, each CH2 group has two equivalent protons. The coupling between these would depend on their neighboring groups.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group would have neighboring Hs. For example, the central CH2 would be between two O=C groups.

Wait, but that's a symmetric structure. The protons on each CH2 would be equivalent and perhaps split into a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex structure. Let me think: if product 2 is an enol ether with a structure like O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a structure where the double bond is in the middle of a chain, like CH2=CH-O-R. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, like O=C-R-O- and O=C-CH2-...

Wait, but more accurately, ozonolysis of CH2=CH-O-R would give formaldehyde and R-O-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Ozone adds to the double bond, and upon workup (like with dimethyl sulfide), it breaks to form carbonyl groups. So, for CH2=CH-O-R, the ozonolysis would produce two carbonyls: one from each end.

Wait, let me take a simple example: if the structure is R-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R', and there's a double bond in the middle, like R-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R' would not have a double bond. Alternatively, if it's R-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-O-R', ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls.

Wait, no. Ozonolysis of CH2=CH-O-R would cleave between the carbons, producing two carbonyl compounds. So, each would be O=C-R-O- and O=C-CH2-O-R? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each carbonyl is formed from each side of the double bond.

So, for CH2=CH-O-R, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules if R is H, but if R is a more complex group, it would split the molecule.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the coupling in product 3.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in product 3, this hydrogen would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens. If the CH2 group is between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Wait, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 group is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-O-R.

In this case, the central CH2 (between two O=C groups) would have two neighboring CH2 groups on either side. But in that case, each CH2 group would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, but let's imagine that the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH2 group that's next to a carbonyl and next to another CH2 group. So, the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. No, that's a bit off.

Alternatively, the structure might be O=C-CH2-CHO. But that would be a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the structure is O=C-CH2-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So, the hydrogen would be split by the neighboring group.

In such a case, each hydrogen on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, let me think about coupling. If a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there are more neighboring groups, perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

Wait, but if the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH2, which is next to another CH2, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is on a CH2 that's adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure where the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group between two carbonyls. So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. The central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, leading to each H being split by the neighboring groups.

Wait, the central CH2 (say, CH2 in the middle of O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O) would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each of its Hs would be split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So, each H would see two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet for each. But wait, each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on each side, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, no, more accurately: each H on the central CH2 is split by the Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. If each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, then each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me explain: each H on the central CH2 is next to a CH2 group on each side. Each adjacent CH2 has two Hs. So, each H on the central CH2 would have coupling with two Hs on one side (let's say the left) and two on the right. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a triplet of triplets?

Wait, when a proton is coupled to two sets of equivalent protons, the splitting is determined by each coupling. For example, if a proton is split by two protons on one side (each with J1) and two on the other (each with J2), the total splitting would be a doublet of doublets. But if the coupling constants are the same (J1 = J2), then it's a triplet.

Alternatively, in a case where a proton is coupled to two equivalent protons on each adjacent group, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is only coupled with one set of Hs, leading to a triplet.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but looking at the options, the options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

So, in the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and perhaps next to another CH2 group. The coupling would be determined by the neighboring Hs.

If the CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each of which has two Hs, then each H on the central CH2 would be split by four Hs (two on each side). But that's not possible because each CH2 can only have two Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group, which has two Hs. So, the CH2 would be next to a CH, which in turn is next to another CH2. In that case, the Hs on the CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH and any other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO. In this case, the CH2 group is next to a carbonyl (O=C) and next to a CH group (CHO). The CH2 would have two Hs, and the adjacent CH has two Hs (but wait, CHO has only one H on the CH). No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-O-R, but that's a ketal and wouldn't have a double bond to undergo ozonolysis.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

In the first step, product 1 is formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. The NMR has a triplet at 4.79 (2H), which is likely an OCH2 group. So, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, it's a ketone with an adjacent OCH2 group.

So, product 1 is a ketone, say, (adamantyl)ketone with an adjacent OCH2 group.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al(iPr)3. Aluminum isopropoxide is often used in the formation of acetals or in Friedel-Crafts reactions. Since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's reacting to form an acetal. So, product 2 would be the acetal of product 1.

So, the ketone O=C-R would react with a diol (maybe from Al(iPr)3 acting as a catalyst) to form an acetal: O=C-R → R-O-CH2-CH2-O-R.

Wait, but acetals typically have two OR groups attached to the former carbonyl carbon. So, perhaps the structure of product 2 is an acetal, like R-O-C(CH2OR')2.

So, product 2 would have a structure like R-O-C(CH2OR')2. Then, when ozonolysis is performed on product 2, which part would react?

Wait, but acetals don't have double bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't cleave them. That suggests that product 2 must have a double bond elsewhere. So, perhaps the acetal formation isn't the correct path here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has a double bond that was formed during the reaction with Al(iPr)3. For example, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether (an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

So, product 2 would have a structure like O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the carbons. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the OCH2 and CH2. So, O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 → O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, that would require the formation of a double bond between the OCH2 and CH2 groups, which isn't possible without another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 → O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't introduce a double bond.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2-O-R group. When treated with Al(iPr)3, it undergoes an elimination to form an enol ether, which introduces a double bond. So, product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to an ether oxygen.

So, product 2 would have a structure like O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the CH2 groups, making it O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2. Then, ozonolysis of this would cleave the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

So, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. The structure O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2 would become O=C-CH2-O- and O=C-CH2-O-R. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: the enol ether is O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the OCH2 and CH2, making it O=C-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 → O=C-CH2-O-CH=CH2.

Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, leading to two carbonyl groups. So, the O=C-CH2-O- part would become O=C-CH2-O-CHO (if R is H), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to the adjacent groups. So, O=C-CH2-O-CHO and another product.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis would produce two aldehyde groups or ketones, depending on the structure.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, which would be near a carbonyl group.

If the ozonolysis produces a structure with a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the Hs on that CH2 would be split by neighboring Hs. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to a CH group (which has two Hs), each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis is O=C-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group is between O=C and CHO. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CHO group, which has a H. But wait, the CHO group has only one H, so each H on the CH2 would be split by that one H, leading to a doublet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the central CH2 would be between two carbonyls. Each H on the central CH2 would be split by two Hs on each adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet of triplets. Because each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, if a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would see two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is between a carbonyl and a CH group (which has two Hs), each H on the CH2 would be split by two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the possible structures.

If product 2 has a double bond, and after ozonolysis, product 3 has two carbonyl groups, the structure might be a diketone or two aldehydes. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

Assuming that after ozonolysis, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls are each split by adjacent CH2 groups, the Hs would have a triplet of triplets coupling.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is only adjacent to one CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the CH2 group is next to a single CH group, which has two Hs. So, each H on the CH2 would be split into a triplet (coupling with two Hs on the CH group), leading to a triplet.

Looking at the options, the most plausible answer seems to be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, leading to a light yellow solid product (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The NMR spectrum includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), suggesting an OCH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Based on this, product 1 is identified as a ketone with an adjacent OCH₂ group.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(iPr)₃**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(iPr)₃), a strong Lewis acid.  
   - This likely induces an elimination reaction, forming an enol ether (product 2), which introduces a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl group.  
   - The structure of product 2 is hypothesized to be an enol ether with a double bond, such as O=C-CH₂-O-CH=CH₂.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.  
   - After ozonolysis and workup with dimethyl sulfide, product 3 is formed.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group, likely on a CH₂ group between two carbonyls.

4. **Coupling Pattern Analysis**  
   - The CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl is flanked by two other CH₂ groups.  
   - Each hydrogen on the central CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on one adjacent CH₂ group and two hydrogens on the other adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - This results in a coupling pattern of a **triplet of triplets** for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Critical evaluation of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: Incorrect, as the coupling involves interactions with hydrogens on both sides of the CH₂ group.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: Correct, as the hydrogen is split by two sets of two equivalent hydrogens, leading to this pattern.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: Incorrect, as there is no single dominant coupling constant overriding the others.  
- **D) Pentet**: Incorrect, as the splitting does not involve five equivalent hydrogens.

The most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
