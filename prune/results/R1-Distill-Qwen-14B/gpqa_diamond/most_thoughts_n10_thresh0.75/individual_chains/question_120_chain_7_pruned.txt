Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution would imply that the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look in the sky. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax itself.

Parallax, I remember, is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait—no, wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So, higher parallax means closer star.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, how does the number of stars in a given parallax interval (like between plx and plx + dplx) depend on plx.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. So perhaps the number density in space is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. But because of perspective—since parallax depends on distance—this will affect how the number of stars per unit parallax changes.

Let me think about this. Let's model the situation. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n*dV.

But dV relates to distance. Because when you consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is related to distance d.plx = 1/d (in parsecs, I think). So d = 1/plx. So dr would be ( - 1/plx² ) dplx, since d = 1/plx. Wait, let me check that.

Differentiating d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element in terms of parallax would change.

Wait, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be the number in the corresponding spherical shells. The shell at distance d has volume 4πd² dr. So substituting d = 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is -dplx/(plx²). So substituting, the number of stars in a small parallax interval dplx
