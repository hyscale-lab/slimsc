Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me start by recalling what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under transformations between different inertial frames, right? So, the laws of physics should look the same no matter how you change your frame as long as you're moving at a constant speed relative to each other. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning it's about the overall structure of spacetime—so it's like the bigger symmetry group that includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries.

CP symmetry is a combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P) symmetries. C symmetry flips the charge of particles, P inverts spatial coordinates. So, if a theory is CP symmetric, then applying both C and P transformations doesn't change the physics.

CPT symmetry is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal). I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz invariant must respect CPT symmetry. Because of that, CPT is a fundamental symmetry, though individual symmetries like C or P might not hold.

Now, SMEFT is an effective field theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually aim to capture physics at low energies, above the cutoff scale. They respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM.

The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Wait, does the SM respect CP? No, because certain processes like the weak interactions do not conserve CP. For example, in the Standard Model, the CKM matrix leads to CP violation in the electroweak sector. So the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. Therefore, operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, meaning they don't have to preserve CP symmetry.

So, any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the SM does. Since Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz, but I think in effective theories, the focus is often on local symmetries, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, Poincaré symmetry is about the isometries of Minkowski spacetime, so it's the combination of Lorentz and translations. So all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. But wait, not sure if SMEFT necessarily requires Poincaré since it's a low-energy theory and includes translations. Hmm, maybe all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry as part of the framework.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries of the SM. So the operators must be built respecting the SM's symmetries, which include Lorentz and Poincaré, but not necessarily CP. So SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, hence also Poincaré. Also, CPT symmetry must be respected because any Lorentz invariant theory
