Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when light passes through different media, its speed changes according to the refractive index. But wait, what happens when the medium itself is moving? Oh right, this must relate to some kind of relativity or maybe the Doppler effect, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem states that a light beam is propagating through glass with index n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking for the speed of light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, so normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Since they say c=1, the speed would be 1/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Oh, right! When the medium is moving, we have to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because light is involved, classical addition wouldn't work here. The formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), but wait, wait. Here, u' is the speed of light in the medium's frame, and the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

Wait, actually, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n, but since the glass is moving towards the observer, I think we need to apply a Lorentz transformation or use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me think. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. The light's speed in the glass's frame is u' = c/n. But since the glass is moving towards the observer, the light's speed relative to the lab would be u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), assuming that u' is in the same direction as v.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula.

So substituting u' = c/n (which is 1/n, since c=1) into the formula.

So u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

But wait, wait. Let me make
