Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Let me think through this step by step.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that looks a bit strange. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable so that the total probability is 1. Also, the wave function must be continuous, but I don't think that's an issue here unless there are discontinuities, which I don't see directly.

Wait, the particles are measured and none were found outside x=1 to x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this region because the probability of finding the particle there is zero. So the wave function should be zero for x <1 and x>3, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but does this expression imply that the wave function is zero outside a certain range?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that's for the region where the particle exists, so between x=1 and x=3. Because the particle isn't found outside, the wave function must be zero outside. So maybe the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given expression applies between 1 and 3.

But how does the wave function behave at the boundaries? Let me think. For x<1, the wave function must be zero. Let me plug in x=1 into the given expression and see what happens. Wait, but the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. At x=1, sqrt(2) is the denominator, so that part is a/sqrt(2), minus 0.5i. But wait, the wave function must be zero at x=1 to prevent the particle from being found there? Or no, because the function is defined where the particle can exist between 1 and 3, so perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that region, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is the correct form between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that when measuring, none were found in x<1 or x>3, which makes
