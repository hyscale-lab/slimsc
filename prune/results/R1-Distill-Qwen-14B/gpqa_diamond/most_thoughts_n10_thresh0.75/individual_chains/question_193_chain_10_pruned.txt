Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, or 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r: r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. So, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), right? Like, plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Wait, let me write that down.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, wait, maybe it's the number of stars per unit volume or something else. Or perhaps it's the number density as a function of distance.

Wait, wait. Let me think.
