Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so maybe I should start by recalling that relationship.

Wait, parallax is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, the formula is usually parallax (in parsecs) equals 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / d, where d is distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? I think it's parallax inversely proportional to distance. So parallax decreases as distance increases. Yeah, so if the distance is bigger, the parallax is smaller.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1 / plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. Let's see, 1/(plx)^5 would be (d)^5, right? Because plx is 1/d, so plx^5 is (1/d)^5, which is 1/d^5. So 1 over that would be d^5.

So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, I think that's about the density—like, the number per unit volume or something. Or maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r.

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r. Because as you go further, you're covering more volume, but the density of stars might change based on their distribution.

Wait, parallax is 1/d, so d is distance. Now, the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that's just N ∝ d^5. But how does the number per unit distance (like per parsec) change? Because the question is asking per unit range of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance would be d^4, because you're taking the derivative dN/dr, I think.

Wait, let me think.
