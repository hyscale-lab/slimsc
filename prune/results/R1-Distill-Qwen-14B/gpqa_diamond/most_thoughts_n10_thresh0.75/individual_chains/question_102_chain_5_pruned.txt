Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells, and why a green signal isn't observed in the mouse offspring when they were supposed to express eGFP. So, the setup involves some genetic constructs and Cre/Lox systems, which I remember are used for conditional gene expression.

First, let's break down the construct. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor) under different promoters perhaps? Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Oh, right, IRES allows the second gene to be expressed without the need for a second promoter, but it's typically used in the same transcriptional unit. So in this case, the ligand is first, with a stop cassette, and the receptor is after an IRES.

Wait, the vector is lox-Cre based. So when Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, allowing expression of the genes. So in the vector, the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, but the ligand is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP. And the receptor is at the 3' end, followed by eGFP, but with a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, I think the setup is such that Cre will excise the stops, allowing expression of the proteins.

Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. So when Cre is expressed, which recognizes loxP, it will excise the loxP-stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor has a lox2272, which is a variant that isn't recognized by Cre unless a different recombinase is used, but in this case, the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, which I think is a mouse model that expresses Cre under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So Cre would recombine loxP sites, but not lox2272.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The vector
