Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it carefully.

The question is about binary star systems and their masses. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, there's information about radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm. I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocities of the two stars are related to their masses. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's orbiting a common center of mass closer to it. The less massive star moves faster. Oh right, that's because of Kepler's laws and the concept of center of mass.

Wait, the radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed each star moves towards or away from us. So for a binary system, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2. And from what I recall, the mass ratio q is the ratio of the masses, where q = M2 / M1. But wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Since the more massive star has a smaller velocity, the velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So v1 is proportional to M2 and v2 proportional to M1? Because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2 due to conservation of momentum, right? So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me compute the mass ratio. Let's say M1 is the mass of the first star and M2 the second. Then M1/M2 = v2 / v1. So v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half of M2's mass, meaning the mass ratio is 0.5. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio (M1 : M2). The total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = (0.5 M2) + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if M1 is larger than M2, M1's velocity v1 will be smaller than v2. Wait, in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So which one is which? Let me suppose that star A has velocity 10, star B has velocity 5. Then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. So M_A / M_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is half of M_B. So
