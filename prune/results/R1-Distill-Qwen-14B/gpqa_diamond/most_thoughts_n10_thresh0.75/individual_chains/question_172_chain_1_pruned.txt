Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we need to find the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2, under the assumption of LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. So the number of particles in a higher energy level compared to a lower one depends on temperature. The formula is something like n_i/n_j = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels i and j, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 for the same energy level. Let me think. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E1 being higher than E2. Wait, but the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = E2 - E1? Or E1 - E2? Oh wait, no, the energy difference between the considered levels is given, so probably the higher level minus the lower. Let's say ΔE is positive.

So for each star, the ratio of atoms in the higher energy level (n_upper) to the lower (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, n_upper1/n_lower1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and for star_2, n_upper2/n_lower2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2? Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. Or maybe not. Because each star's own ratio depends on their own temperature.

Wait, let me re-read that part. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_
