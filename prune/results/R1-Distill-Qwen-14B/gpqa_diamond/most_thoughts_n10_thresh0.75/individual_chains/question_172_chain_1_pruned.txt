Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I've just started learning about stellar atmospheres and LTE, so I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. But the main thing here is the excitation level, so probably this relates to the Boltzmann equation, right? Because in LTE, the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution.

So the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in a particular energy state to the temperature. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation level is the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (say, level 2) to the ground state (level 1). So if in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2, let me denote that as (N2/N1)_1 = 2 * (N2/N1)_2.

Wait, wait, actually the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the lower state. So star_1 has a higher excitation, meaning higher ratio.

Let me define it more clearly. Let’s say for each star, the ratio of the number of excited atoms (n2) to the lower state (n1) is R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

According to Boltzmann, R = (n2/n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is for the energy difference. Oh right, ΔE is E_upper - E_lower. So if the upper level is higher in energy, the ratio would be exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So higher temperature would make the exponential less negative, meaning higher ratio.

So for star_1, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But the problem states that R1 = 2 R2. So substituting:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. 

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, let's see. Because ln(ab) = ln a + ln b. So the right-hand side becomes ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) ), which is ln(2) - ΔE
