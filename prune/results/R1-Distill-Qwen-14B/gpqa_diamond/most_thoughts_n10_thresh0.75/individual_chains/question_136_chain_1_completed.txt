Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. So, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially, and it's only got a radial component in spherical coordinates.

Wait, so the field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So, in spherical coordinates, that would be f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, right? Because everything else, the theta and phi components, are zero.

The problem is asking for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere. So, the integral is ∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume. I remember from vector calculus that there's something called the divergence theorem which relates this volume integral to a surface integral of the flux through the boundary. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe it's easier to compute the divergence first and see what the integral becomes.

Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates since the field is given in spherical terms. The divergence of a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is given by (1/(r²)) * d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dA_φ/dφ. But since our vector field only has a radial component, A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/(r²)) d(r² A_r)/dr.

In this problem, A_r is f(r) = 1/r². So plugging that into the divergence formula, we get (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that. r² times 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Wait, that would make the divergence zero? But wait, I'm not sure. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇ · f is zero? But that can't be right because there's a point charge or something at the origin perhaps, like in the case of the electric field. Because wait, in electromagnetism, the electric field of a point charge has a divergence proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function at the origin. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Hmm, so let me think again. If f(r) is 1/r² in the radial direction, then the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin. But the integral over the volume—so the volume integral of the divergence is just zero except if there's a delta function contribution. Oh wait, but is that the case here?

Wait, no. Let me compute the divergence more carefully. So, A_r is 1/r². So the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) ) = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's not defined because the field behaves like a delta function.

Wait, but wait a second. The divergence is zero except at the origin. So when we integrate the divergence over the entire volume, the integral would be zero. But wait, wait, because in reality, for E fields like 1/r², the divergence is zero except at the origin, but integrating over a volume that includes the origin might capture some non-zero value. Oh, because the divergence at the origin would be a delta function, perhaps.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, wait. Let me think about this again. The divergence of the vector field f(r) = 1/(r²) r̂. Let me compute ∇ · f. Using the formula in spherical coordinates for the divergence, as I did before, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr ( r² A_r ). Since A_r is 1/r², r² A_r is 1. So the derivative is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So, for any point not at r=0, the divergence is zero. So when I integrate over the volume of the sphere of radius R, which doesn't include the origin if R is not zero? Wait, no, the sphere is centered at the origin, so the origin is inside the sphere.

Wait, but again, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So integrating the divergence over the volume would give zero? Hmm. But wait, that's not correct. Because in the case of the electric field, for example, the divergence is zero except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So the integral over a volume that includes the origin would be the charge enclosed divided by epsilon_0. But in this problem, are we given any information about a charge? No. So perhaps the divergence is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If I have a vector field that's 1/r² radial, then the divergence is zero except at r=0. So when I integrate the divergence over the entire sphere, it would be zero, because the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point. But wait, the integral of a function that's zero everywhere except at a point is zero, because the point has zero volume. So the integral would be zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because, for example, for the electric field, even though the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, the integral over a sphere enclosing the origin is non-zero because of Gauss's law. So what's the difference there?

Ah, because in the case of the electric field, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So the integral would be the charge enclosed. But in this problem, the vector field is given as 1/r², but there's no mention of any charge. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere, including inside the sphere, but wait, that can't be because at the origin, the field may have a divergence.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me recompute it. So, vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So, A_r is 1/r², and A_θ = A_φ = 0. So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * A_r ) = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) =0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0.

Wait, but wait. The expression 1/r² behaves like a delta function at r=0. So the divergence might be a delta function at the origin. But in that case, when integrating over the sphere, which includes the origin, the integral would not be zero. It would be the integral of the delta function, which would be 4π times the coefficient of the delta function.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this with the case of the electric field, which has a divergence proportional to rho(r), which is a delta function. But in this problem, f(r) is given as 1/r², so perhaps its divergence is zero except at the origin, but how?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the case of a point charge, the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r̂)/r². The divergence of E is (1/(4πε₀)) q δ³(r). So when you integrate the divergence over all space, you get the charge. But in this problem, is the vector field f(r) = 1/r² r̂, which is similar to E without the 1/(4πε₀) and without the charge. So the divergence would be ∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = 0, as before. But wait, but this is under the assumption that the field is smooth everywhere except the origin. But when r approaches zero, the field f(r) behaves in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the divergence is zero everywhere. Because in reality, when you have a vector field that behaves like 1/r², it's similar to the Coulomb field, whose divergence is a delta function at the origin. But wait, why is that? Let me think again.

Wait, let me think of the vector field as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, which is the same as f(r) = r̂ / r². The divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r ). A_r is 1/r², so r² A_r is 1. The derivative is zero, so divergence is zero. So, the divergence is zero at all points except at r=0, where the function isn't defined.

But if I integrate the divergence over the sphere of radius R, which includes r=0, then what's the integral? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over a point is zero because volume element is zero.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because in the case of a delta function, the integral over a region that includes the origin is non-zero. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I compute the divergence correctly?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of f over a volume V is equal to the flux of f through the surface enclosing V.

So, the integral of ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R is equal to the surface integral of f · n̂ dS over the sphere's surface.

But f is radial, so f · n̂ is just f(r) at r=R because n̂ is radial. So f(r) at r=R is 1/R². The surface integral becomes the integral over the sphere's surface of (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, because n̂ is radial, and f(r) is radial, so the dot product is [1/R²] * [R² sinθ dθ dφ]? Wait, no, let me be precise.

Wait, the flux through a surface element is f · n̂ dS. n̂ is the outward unit normal, which is r̂ on the sphere. So f · n̂ is f_r * (r̂ · r̂) ) = f_r. Since f_r at r=R is 1/R². The differential surface area element dS in spherical coordinates is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So the flux is (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ = sinθ dθ dφ.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So at r=R, f(R) is (1/R²) r̂. The differential surface vector is dS = R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂. So the dot product f · dS is (1/R²) r̂ · (R² sinθ dθ dφ r̂) ) = (1/R²)(R²) sinθ dθ dφ (r̂ · r̂ ) = (1) sinθ dθ dφ *1.

So the surface integral becomes the integral over θ and φ of sinθ dθ dφ. The limits for θ are 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π. So that integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dφ ∫ (from 0 to π) sinθ dθ. The integral of sinθ from 0 to π is 2, and the integral of dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π. So the surface integral is (2π) * (2) )=4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere is equal to the surface integral, which is 4π. But wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought the divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero.

Hmm, but according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral is 4π. But according to my calculation of the divergence ∇ · f being zero, the integral would be zero. Which can't both be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me recompute that. The divergence formula in spherical coordinates is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dA_φ/dφ.

In this case, A_θ and A_φ are zero, so the other terms vanish. So it's (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r ). A_r is 1/r², so r^2 A_r is 1. Then, d/dr (r^2 A_r ) = d/dr (1) = 0. So the divergence is zero. Thus, the volume integral of the divergence should be zero. But the surface integral gives 4π, which by divergence theorem should be equal to the volume integral. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, this is confusing. I think I must have mixed up something. Let me think again. The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So its divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0. But according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. But I calculated the flux to be 4π, which suggests that the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.

But according to my earlier calculation, the divergence is zero, so the integral should be zero, but that contradicts the divergence theorem. So I must have made a mistake in the divergence calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the expression for the divergence. Let me double-check the formula. The divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/ sinφ) dA_φ/dφ. Hmm, no, wait, the third term is (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dA_φ/dφ? No, I think that's correct. But in any case, since A_θ and A_φ are zero, those two terms vanish.

So, for A_r = 1/r², the first term is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r² ). r² times 1/r² is 1, so d/dr of 1 is zero. So the divergence is zero. So that suggests that the volume integral is zero. But according to the surface integral, it's 4π. So there's a contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the vector field f(r) = 1/r² r̂ is singular at the origin, and the divergence theorem applies only when the vector field is smooth within and on the surface. But here, f(r) isn't defined at r=0, so perhaps the divergence isn't zero in the distributional sense. In that case, the divergence would include a delta function at the origin.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the divergence isn't just zero but includes a delta function. Let me think: the divergence of f(r) = (1/r²) r̂ is zero everywhere except at r=0. But in reality, the divergence is a distribution, so it includes a delta function at the origin. So the divergence ∇ · f is equal to 4π δ³(r). Because, for example, in electromagnetism, the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, which for a point charge is a delta function.

Wait, but how does that apply here? Let me think: If f(r) is (1/r²) r̂, then the divergence is 4π delta(r) (since for E, it's (1/(4πε₀)) (q r̂/r²), whose divergence is (q/(4πε₀)) delta(r) ), so in this case, without the constants, f(r) would have a divergence of 4π delta(r).

But wait, in our case, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So the divergence would be 4π delta(r). Because the surface integral through a sphere enclosing the origin would be 4π times the coefficient in the delta function.

So, then, the volume integral of ∇ · f over the sphere of radius R is ∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫ (4π delta(r)) dV ) =4π.

But wait, from the earlier calculation using the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface is 4π, so the volume integral is 4π. That makes sense. But wait, why did our calculation of the divergence itself give zero everywhere except at r=0? Because in the distributional sense, the divergence includes the delta function.

So, putting it all together, the integral of the divergence is 4π.

Wait, but the options don't have 4π as the only possibility. Let me look again.

Options are:
A) 4 π
B) 1
C)4/3 π R
D)0

So, the integral is 4π, so the answer would be option A.

But wait, wait a second. Another approach: Let's compute the divergence using the limit definition. The divergence at a point is the limit as V approaches zero of the flux through the surface enclosing the volume V divided by V. So, for a small sphere of radius a around the origin, the flux is 4π (as computed earlier). So, the divergence at the origin would be (flux)/(volume) as a approaches zero. The volume is (4/3 π a³). So, (4π) / (4/3 π a³) )= 3/(a³). As a approaches zero, this tends to infinity. So, the divergence is a delta function scaled by 4π, perhaps.

But then, when we integrate the divergence over the sphere of radius R, which includes the origin, the integral would be 4π. But if R is zero, the integral would be zero because the sphere has zero volume. But in our case, R is a positive number, so the sphere includes the origin, and the integral is 4π.

But wait, the question is about the volume integral of the divergence of f(r). So, according to the divergence theorem, this is equal to the flux integral which is 4π, so the answer is 4π.

But wait, wait, the problem says that the vector field has non-zero component only along the radial direction, and the field falls off as 1/r². So, perhaps the divergence is indeed 4π delta(r), and the integral over any volume that includes the origin is 4π, regardless of R. So, for R>0, the integral is 4π. So the answer is A) 4 π.

But earlier I thought that the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, and the integral is 4π, not zero. So, the correct answer must be A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin, we proceed as follows:

The vector field is given as **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂** in spherical coordinates, with non-zero components only along the radial direction. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 A_r \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} \frac{d}{d\theta} \left( A_\theta \sin\theta \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} \frac{1}{\phi} \frac{dA_\phi}{d\phi}.
\]

Since the vector field has only a radial component, \(A_\theta = A_\phi = 0\), and the divergence simplifies to:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 A_r \right).
\]

For **f(r)** = (1/r²) **r̂**, the radial component is \(A_r = 1/r^2\). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of **f(r)** is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field becomes singular. At the origin, the divergence behaves like a delta function, \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r)\), reflecting the presence of a point-like source.

To compute the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \(R\), we use the divergence theorem, which states:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS,
\]

where \(S\) is the surface of the sphere. The flux through the surface is:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface flux, which is \(4\pi\). This result holds because the sphere of radius \(R\) encloses the origin, where the divergence contributes the delta function term.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) \(4\pi\):** Correct. The volume integral of the divergence is \(4\pi\), as shown by the divergence theorem.
- **B) 1:** Incorrect. This value does not match the result of the integral.
- **C) \(\frac{4}{3} \pi R\):** Incorrect. This expression does not correspond to the divergence integral.
- **D) 0:** Incorrect. While the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the integral over the sphere is not zero because the divergence includes a delta function at the origin.

The correct answer is **A) \(4\pi\)**.

Answer: A
