Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me think through this carefully. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. Interesting. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature—like Wien's Law. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Got it.

Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us, right? But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm, maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's about Doppler shift. Oh, but wait, the question says to assume the stars are radiating as black bodies. So perhaps the radial velocities affect the observed wavelength, but since we're using the peak wavelength as observed, maybe that's already accounted for. Hmm, not entirely sure about that part yet.

The main question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are around 2.2 to 2.35. So, I need to calculate the luminosity ratio.

I recall that the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² multiplied by T⁴, all multiplied by some constants which are same for both stars.

Wait, so if I take the ratio of the luminosities, L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, because Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

Now, what about the temperatures? From Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where
