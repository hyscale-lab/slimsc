Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, wait, but the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to the star's radius and temperature, not mass. But mass might come into play through other means, like determining the gravitational pull affecting the star's structure, but I'm not sure yet.

The spectroscopy part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait, could the peak wavelength be due to other factors, like their velocities? Oh, wait, the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So it's the same as their rest frame, or is there a Doppler shift? Because the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

Ah, right, the radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength is different from the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So we have to account for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual temperature of each star.

Hmm, okay. So let's break it down.

For each star, the observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but that's for non-relativistic speeds, right? Alternatively, since 700 km/s isn't extremely high, but wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% the speed of light, which is small. So maybe using the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction. If a star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is longer (redshifted), and if moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ_obs is shorter (blueshifted).

Wait, but in the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so v1 = 0. Star_2 has v2 = 700 km/s. Hmm, but which direction? The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700. I'm not told which is moving towards or away. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ is same for both.

So, let me write down the Doppler shift formula. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

But if we're dealing with small velocities, perhaps we can approximate this as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c). Wait, but I'm not sure about the direction. Let me think. For a source moving away with velocity v, the observed wavelength increases. So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but we don't know if it's moving towards or away. Wait, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, the problem says "radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_1's radial velocity is zero, meaning no movement towards or away
