Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the confocal microscopy after crossing the mice. Let me think through the setup step by step.

First, the question is about a bicistronic vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors allow two genes to be expressed from a single construct, each under their own promoter. But wait, in this case, the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, and the receptor is at the 3'. They've got some stop cassettes with loxP sites.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Then, the receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can drive expression of the downstream gene without a second promoter. So the ligand is first, then IRES, then the receptor. So the vector probably expresses the ligand and receptor in a single mRNA transcript, with the IRES allowing the receptor to be translated after the ligand.

Looking at the fusions: the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand protein will have mCherry attached, and the receptor will have eGFP at the end.

But wait, the stops are important. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor has a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. So in the vector, the ligand is before the stop, then mCherry? Or is it that the ORFs are followed by these stop cassettes?

Wait, the setup says ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So perhaps the gene is arranged as CBA promoter --> ligand gene (ORF) --> mCherry, but between them is a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly for the receptor with IRES and eGFP.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the transcript would have the lig
