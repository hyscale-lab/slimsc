Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mitochondrial function and some experiments. I need to figure out which experiment won't help determine the drug's effect on mitochondria. Let me think this through.

The question is about a new anti-diabetes drug and whether it affects mitochondria in HEK293 cells. The options are four different experiments, and I need to find out which one won't help discover the mitochondrial role.

First, I remember that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, involved in energy production through processes like the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. The question mentions redox reactions and storing energy between phosphate groups, which sounds like ATP. So the drug might affect ATP production or mitochondrial function in general.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria followed by a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a standard method to isolate mitochondria because they're heavier than other organelles. Once you have pure mitochondria, using a glucose uptake assay would measure how well the mitochondria take in glucose. But wait, aren't mitochondria dependent on other energy sources, like fatty acids or other substrates? I thought glucose is primarily used by the cytosol, and maybe the mitochondria use the resulting ATP. Or maybe some glucose is metabolized in the mitochondria? Hmm, but if the assay is for glucose uptake, this could indicate mitochondrial function. So this option would show if the drug affects glucose uptake into mitochondria. So this experiment would help; thus, it's not the correct answer.

Option B: Transfecting cells with luciferase and adding luciferin. Wait, luciferase is an enzyme used in reporter genes, commonly for measuring things like ATP levels. Because luciferin needs ATP to light up. So if the drug affects mitochondrial function, which produces ATP, adding luciferin to the supernatant (which contains ATP from cells) would show if the drug changes ATP levels. Wait, but waitâ€”if the cells are lysed, the ATP would be in the supernatant. But in this case, they are adding luciferin to the supernatant, so maybe measuring ATP release. Or perhaps the luciferase is inside the cells. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to measure mitochondrial ATP because the recombinant luciferase is inside the mitochondria? Or maybe it's a general ATP assay
