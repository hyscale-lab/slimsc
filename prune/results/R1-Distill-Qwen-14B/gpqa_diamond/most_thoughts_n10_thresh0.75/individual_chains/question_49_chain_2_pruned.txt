Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I've studied, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and they are usually thermodynamically favored.

The problem has three reaction parts, each producing compounds A, B, and C. I need to figure out which options (A to D) correctly match each product.

Let's take each part one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) → A**

Hmm. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The reagents are H+ and heat, which probably mean some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a secondary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. But when I think about Claisen rearrangement, it typically involves allyl vinyl ethers. But wait, maybe here it's a similar rearrangement but involving an amine.

Alternatively, maybe the two reactants undergo some kind of condensation. But wait, maybe the but-3-en-2-ol has an OH group that can act as a nucleophile or form an enol.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine could be something like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. So, when it's heated under acidic conditions, perhaps it undergoes a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the two starting materials are combining in a way that forms a ring.

Wait, but in the presence of H+ and heat, I'm thinking of the possibility of a Cope or Claisen-like rearrangement. But perhaps another type of sigmatropic shift.

Alternatively, considering that the amine is 1,1-dimethoxy, upon heating, maybe the methoxy groups are involved in some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The starting amine is ethan-1-amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So the structure is (CH2OCH3)2NH. When heated, maybe it forms an iminium ion or something that can undergo a hydride shift or a sigma shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the other reactant, but-3-en-2-ol, which is an allylic alcohol, could form an enol ether or something else.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Or perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me correct: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, butenol numbering... Maybe it's CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. Hmm, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, and the OH on C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but that would be but-2-en-2-ol? Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOHCH2? No, maybe I should draw it.

But-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3, so that's between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's impossible because but has only four carbons. Oh, wait, no. The numbering starts from the end closest to the OH group. So but-3-en-2-ol would be: the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but that would be CH2CH(OH)CH2-CH2? No, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond from C3 to C4, but that would be an impossible position because but only has four carbons. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of but-3-en-2-ol as CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, that's but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. So, with the OH on C3? No, wait, the OH is on C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, that would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the OH on C3? Wait, but that's but-1-en-3-ol. Oh, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's impossible because but has four carbons. So, perhaps but-3-en-2-ol is actually (CH2)2CHOHCH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4—wait, that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I should move on for now and come back.

But regardless, the reaction is under H+ and heat, so
