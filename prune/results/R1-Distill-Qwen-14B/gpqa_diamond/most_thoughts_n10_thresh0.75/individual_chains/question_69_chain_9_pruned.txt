Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think this has to do with the particle's lifetime as observed versus its proper lifetime. Oh right, because particles moving at relativistic speeds will have their lifetimes dilated. So time dilation comes into play here.

The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. From our lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime appears longer. The gamma factor (γ) is the Lorentz factor which tells us how much time dilation occurs.

But wait, how do I calculate γ here? Oh, right. γ is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. So γ = E / m. Since the energy E is given as 27 GeV and the mass m is 3.41 GeV, I can compute that.

Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 7.6 is about 25.916, 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*7=23.87, plus 3.41*0.9=3.069 → 26.939. Oh, so 27 is about 7.93 times 3.41. So γ is approximately 7.93.

Wait, let me double-check the math. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 3.41 * 7.9: 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069. 23.87 +3.069=26.939. So yeah, 27/3.41 is roughly 7.93. So γ ≈7.93.

Then, the observed lifetime τ is γ multiplied by τ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀. So τ = 7.93 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me calculate that. 7.93 *8 is about 63.44. So 63.44e-16 seconds, which is 6.344e-15 seconds. Is that right?

Wait, no: 7.93 *8 is 63.44, but we're dealing with 8e-16, so 7.93 *8e-16 = (7.93*8) * 1e-16 → 63.44e-16 s which is 6.344e-15 s. Yeah.

Now, the Bubble Chamber is a detector that needs to have a good enough time resolution to see the decay. The idea is that the minimum time resolution (let's say Δt) should be such that a certain fraction of decays are observed. Wait, but how does the time resolution relate to the number of decays observed?

Wait, I think it's about the decay length. Because the particle is moving, during its lifetime (dilated τ), it travels a certain distance before decaying. The Bubble Chamber can only detect the decay if the separation between the original point and the decay point is larger than the resolution Δx. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, I think that the probability of observing the decay is the fraction of the decay length that is larger than the resolution.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The particle's lifetime determines how long it exists in our lab frame. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. The Bubble Chamber's resolution will determine how well it can measure the decay point. So, for the decay to be detected, the distance traveled (decay length) must be greater than the resolution. So, the probability P that a decay is observed is the fraction of the time that the decay occurs beyond the resolution. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the particle's velocity and how much time it takes to travel the length before decaying. Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, the number of decays observed is a function of the resolution. If the resolution
