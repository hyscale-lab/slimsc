Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. Alright, let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says that there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, but wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity in the way they're talking about here. Because the question is about luminosity based on black body radiation, right?

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. I remember from black body radiation that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both have the same peak wavelength, they must be at the same temperature? Because according to Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same, T is the same for both. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but the problem says they're using the black body radiation model. So I can go ahead and model their luminosity based on that. Luminosity for a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, where R is the radius and T is the temperature. So since both stars have the same temperature, I can compare their luminosities based on their radii.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, which probably means it's not moving towards or away from us in a way that affects the observed wavelength much, or maybe it's stationary. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but how does that affect the observed luminosity?

I think this comes into play with the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light is Doppler shifted. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler shift has been accounted for, or perhaps the velocities are used
