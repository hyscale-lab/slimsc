Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

Okay, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass that's 1.5 times larger. Wait, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I'm trying to recall the formula for luminosity of a star. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that luminosity (L) is proportional to the radius squared times the temperature to the fourth power. So, L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ (2.9 × 10^-3 m·K) / T. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Wait, is that right? Because if λ_max is the same, then T would be same for both. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So both stars have the same temperature. Hmm, that's interesting because if T is same, then the luminosity depends only on radius squared. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies. So yes, we can apply Wien's law.

So, Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4)/(R2² T2^4). But since T1=T2 (because λ_max same), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest the answer is around 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options include other choices as well, like ~2.32 and ~2.23. So why are the options not exactly 2.
