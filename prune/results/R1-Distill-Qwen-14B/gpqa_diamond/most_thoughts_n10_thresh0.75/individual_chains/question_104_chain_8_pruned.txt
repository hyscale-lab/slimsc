Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, the question involves two planets around stars with the same mass as our Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. They found the planets using the RV method, which detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

So the setup is: Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, what's the RV method again? Oh right, the Doppler shift. The star moves towards and away from us as the planet orbits, causing a shift in the spectral lines. The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the star, and the orbital period and the distance of the planet from the star.

I remember that the RV method's signal (the velocity amplitude) is given by some formula. Let me think. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)) ) )

Wait, but in this case, the planets have similar masses to Neptune, and the stars are similar to the Sun. So M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star. So the formula simplifies a bit. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so denominator is 1.

So the formula for K simplifies to:

K = ( (G * M_p^3 ) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)) ) )

Wait, wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, the formula is K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e is 0, and M_p is much smaller than M_*, sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal), so this simplifies.

Let me try to write the simplified version. So K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, more accurately, the formula is:

K = (v) = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator is M_*^(2/3). Also, the sin i is 1 since it's edge-on, which we can assume for maximum effect.

So K ≈ ( (27 pi G) / (c^3 P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the proportionality. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, M_p is same for both planets (since both are like Neptune), and M_* is same for both stars.

Therefore, the ratio of K1 and K2 will be related to the ratio of P1 and P2.

Wait, no, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Because when you cube both sides, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, let me think about this again.

The formula for K:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1/(c * P^(1/3)))

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula, but I think the key relationship is that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So if K1 is the velocity amplitude for Planet 1, and K2 for Planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1) / (M_p2) ) * (M_*2^(2/3) / M_*1^(2/3)) ) * (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3)) ) ]

But in this problem, M_p1 ≈ M_p2 (both Neptune-like), and M_*1 = M_*2 (same star masses). So the ratio K1/K2 simplifies to (P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = (constant) * (1/P1^(1/3)), and K2 = (constant) * (1/P2^(1/3)) ). So K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) )

Wait, no, let me redo:

If K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K1 = K0 * (1/P1^(1/3)) ), K2 = K0 * (1/P2^(1/3)) )

So K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) ) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, that would suggest that K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So if K1 is smaller than K2, then P2 must be larger than P1.

Wait, in the question, Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstrom, Planet #2 is 7. So K is proportional to the shift, right? Because a larger velocity would cause a larger Doppler shift. So K1 = 5, K2=7.

Wait, but the problem states that the shifts are 5 and 7 miliangstroms. So K2=7 mA, K1=5 mA. That means K2 > K1.

So according to the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1, because (1/P2^(1/3)) is larger than (1/P1^(1/3)).

Wait, but wait! Let me think again. Because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so a larger K implies a smaller P. So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

But the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, that means P2 / P1 = ?

Wait, let me correct that. The question is, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is longer, then the ratio is greater than 1. If K2 > K1, then P2 < P1, so the ratio is less than 1.

But wait, maybe I'm getting this
