Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read through the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so standard conditions maybe.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The options are all in the 10^-7 M range, so it's going to be a pretty dilute concentration, maybe?

I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The dissociation constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) are given: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So these are sequential dissociation steps of phosphoric acid.

So, I think the key here is to determine the pH of the solution first because the concentration of PO4^3- depends on the pH. Once we know the pH, we can use the appropriate expression to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but how do I find the pH? The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. I recall that when a weak acid and its conjugate base are present in a solution, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. 

So, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^-·K+ (since it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. Wait, no, actually, Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is Na2HPO4, and when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). These two are adjacent species in the phosphate ion series. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another to become PO4^3-.

Since both are present, this is a buffer solution. The pH can be determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant pKa here is the second one, since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are involved. The second dissociation corresponds to Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is approximately 7.207 (since log(6.2)=0.79, 10^(-7.207)=6.2e-8).

Wait, wait, no. Henderson-Hasselbalch is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). The acid in this case is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the base)). So the ratio is [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

So first, I need to calculate the concentrations of these two ions in the solution.

The solution is 200 cm³, so 0.2 liters.

Let's calculate moles of each.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005619 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, the molecular weight of Na2HPO4 is 177.99 g/mol. So yes, moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005619.

So, in the solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is (0.007346 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.03673 M.

And the concentration of HPO4^2- is (0.005619 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.028095 M.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log (6.2e-8) inverse? Wait, no. pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So pH = 7.207 + log(0.028095 / 0.03673). Let me compute that ratio: 0.028095 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.7655.

Log(0.7655) is approximately -0.114.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

Wait, that's about 7.09. But wait, let me make sure the calculation is accurate.

Alternatively, I can compute the exact ratio.

0.028095 / 0.03673 = (approx 0.0281 / 0.0367) = 0.766.

Log(0.766) is roughly log(0.7) is about -0.15, and 0.766 is a bit higher. Let's compute it more accurately.

Log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + log(1e-1) = approximately 0.8847 - 1 = -0.1153.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.1153 ≈ 7.0917. Let's say approximately 7.09.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that this is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH will be around pKa2. Since the ratio is less than 1, the pH will be below pKa2, which is why the pH is lower than 7.207, so around 7.09.

Now that I have the pH, I can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-. The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression for Ka3.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But since [H+] is 1e-pH, because pH = -log[H+]. So [H+] = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So, plugging in the numbers.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M (from before, but wait, is that correct? Because HPO4^2- might also be involved in other equilibria. Hmm, but the solution's buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which means that the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.028095 M, but perhaps I should consider that the concentration is determined by the buffer. Wait, but the initial moles are leading to these concentrations, and their ratio determines the pH. So the [HPO4^2-] is the concentration in solution, which is 0.028095 M.

Wait no, because the solution is a buffer, and in the buffer, the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in the ratio dictated by the Henderson-Hasselbalch. So the actual concentrations of these ions are determined by the amount added and the volume, but the ratio is adjusted based on the pH.

But for the purpose of calculating [PO4^3-], perhaps I can use the concentration of HPO4^2- as 0.028095 M, but that's only true if it's not reacting further. But actually, some of the HPO4^2- will dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but the [HPO4^2-] I calculated earlier is the actual concentration in solution before considering the dissociation into PO4^3-. So I think the correct approach is to use that concentration in the Ka3 expression.

Wait, but when you have a solution, the species are in equilibrium. So the [HPO4^2-] in the solution is a certain value, and some of it dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.

So, let's set up the expression: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028095 M, [H+] = 10^-7.09 ≈ 8.23e-8.

So plugging in:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028095) / (8.23e-8).

Let me compute the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.028095 ≈ 5.057e-14.

Denominator is 8.23e-8.

So 5.057e-14 / 8.23e-8 = approximately 6.144e-7 M.

Wait, that would give me about 6.14e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7), but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, [H+] is 10^(-7.09), which is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09). 10^(-0.09) is approximately 0.81. So 1e-7 * 0.81 = 8.1e-8, which is about 8.1e-8.

So let's compute again with exact numbers.

First, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028095 M.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[H+] = 8.1e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028095) / (8.1e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028095 = 5.0571e-14.

Divide by 8.1e-8: 5.0571e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0571 / 8.1 ) * 1e-6.

5.0571 /8.1 ≈ 0.624.

So 0.624e-6 = 6.24e-7 M.

That's option A: 6.24x10^-7 M.

But wait, let me think again. Because the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, does that affect any other equilibria?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the total concentration of phosphate species includes H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, but considering the buffer, the main species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But for the purpose of calculating PO4^3-, we're only considering the third dissociation.

Also, considering that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M, and in the presence of that, a small amount will dissociate into PO4^3-.

But wait, the calculation I did uses [HPO4^2-] as 0.028095 M, but that's the concentration in the solution before considering any dissociation. Since HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-, the actual concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution is slightly less than 0.028095 M, and PO4^3- is a small amount in addition.

But wait, since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2-, which in turn comes from H2PO4^- and so on, maybe the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M is okay because the dissociation of HPO4^2- is very small. Let's see.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the dissociation extent would be minimal. So, when we calculate [PO4^3-] as (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+], we can approximate [HPO4^2-] as 0.028095 M because the change is negligible. So our initial approach is valid.

So, the calculation gives us [PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M.

But wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute the [PO4^3-].

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator. [H+] is 10^-7.09. Let's compute that accurately.

pH =7.09 → [H+] =10^-7.09.

10^0.09 ≈ 1.229 (since 10^0.07918 ≈ 1.2, and 0.09 is a bit higher). Wait, 10^0.09 is about 1.23. So [H+] = 1e-7 / 1.23 → approximately 8.13e-8.

So, let's do the exact calculation with [H+] = 8.13e-8.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M.

So, the numerator is 1.8e-12 * 0.028095 = 5.0571e-14.

Denominator is 8.13e-8.

5.0571e-14 / 8.13e-8 = (5.0571 /8.13 ) * 1e-6.

5.0571 /8.13 ≈ 0.6217.

So 0.6217e-6 = 6.217e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.22e-7 M. So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal points to get a more accurate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the pH. Let me recheck the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.028095 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M.

Ratio = 0.028095 / 0.03673 = let me compute this more accurately.

0.028095 ÷ 0.03673.

Let me compute 28095 ÷ 36730.

Well, 36730 × 0.766 is about 28095. So 0.766.

log(0.766) as I said is approximately -0.114.

So pH = 7.207 -0.114 =7.093.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I can compute the exact log value.

Using a calculator, log(0.766) = approximately log(7.66) - log(10) = 0.8847 -1 = -0.1153.

So pH=7.207 -0.1153=7.0917.

That's about 7.0917, so [H+] = 10^-7.0917 ≈ 8.11e-8.

So using [H+] =8.11e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028095) /8.11e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028095 = 5.0571e-14.

Divide by 8.11e-8: 5.0571e-14 /8.11e-8 = (5.0571 /8.11) * 1e-6.

5.0571 ÷8.11 ≈ 0.6237.

So 0.6237e-6 =6.237e-7 M.

Which is about 6.24e-7 M. So option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A is 6.24e-7, which matches.

But I feel like maybe I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the total concentration of phosphate species. The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, but in the solution, phosphate can exist in various forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. The dominant species depends on pH.

In this case, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the dominant species are those two, but some PO4^3- is present due to the third dissociation.

But wait, let's not get confused. The calculation I did should be correct.

Another thing to check: Did I compute the moles correctly?

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09 → 1/136.09 ≈0.007346 mol. So yes, 0.007346 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol ≈0.005619 mol.

So, yes, that's correct.

So the concentrations are 0.03673 M H2PO4^- and 0.028095 M HPO4^2-.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation gives pH around 7.09.

Then [PO4^3-] is 6.24e-7 M.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M 

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M 

So A is what I got.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I need to use the exact concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But given that Ka3 is very small, the dissociation is minimal. So the assumption that [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028095 M is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact expression.

The dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028095) / (8.11e-8) ≈ 6.24e-7 M.

Which is exactly option A.

So the correct answer must be A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, with molecular weights 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molecular Weight}} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005619 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007346}{0.2} \approx 0.03673 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005619}{0.2} \approx 0.028095 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, with the relevant dissociation constant \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The pKa is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log\left(\frac{0.028095}{0.03673}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.7655)
\]
\[
\log(0.7655) \approx -0.114 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{pH} = 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the concentration of PO₄³⁻
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H}^+
\]
The dissociation constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression for \( K_a3 \):  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
The \([\text{H}^+]\) is calculated from the pH:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.13 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028095)}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0571 \times 10^{-14}}{8.13 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option **A**.

**Answer: A**
