Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. Parallax is usually denoted by 'plx', so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax plx is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs (d), so plx = 1/d. So, if I rewrite the equation using distance, since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N ∝ d^5? Hmm, but wait, let's be precise.

Let me write down the relationship. N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Because plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N = k * (d)^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so we're looking for the rate of change of N with respect to d. That is, dN/dd. Because per unit distance, how much does N change.

So if N = k d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are about how
