Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 is propene because propene has the formula C3H6 (it's an alkene). So, A is propene.

Then, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually refers to an addition reaction. Since propene is a simple alkene, when it reacts with bromine (probably Br2), it would add across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, since propene is CH2=CH2CH3, adding Br2 would add across the double bond. The positions would be 1 and 2, so the structure would be BrCH2CHBrCH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually is a condition for elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, two equivalents of KOH would deprotonate and remove the Br atoms, leading to elimination. Wait, but wait. 1,2-dibromopropane would lose two equivalents of HBr. Let me think: each Br is on adjacent carbons. When KOH is present, it would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, the first step of reaction with B and alcoholic KOH would produce propene again, but wait, perhaps there's more. Wait, but no, 1,2-dibromopropane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with strong base. So, for each Br, perhaps the base would abstract a β H, leading to elimination of HBr, but since there are two Brs on adjacent carbons, maybe it forms an alkene. Let's think: propene has CH2=CHCH3. When it undergoes bromination, Br adds across the double bond to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate twice. So, perhaps it forms propene again or maybe another alkene.

Wait, so the first elimination would form CH2=CH2CH3 (propene) but with another Br on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe I should draw this out. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide becomes an epoxide, but no, that's with other conditions. No, I think it's more likely elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation. So, in the case of 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it's a dihalide, so perhaps two dehydrohalogenation steps occur.

Wait, for vicinal dihalides (adjacent Brs), when treated with alcoholic KOH, they typically eliminate twice, forming an alkene. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, the reaction would produce propene again. So compound C would
