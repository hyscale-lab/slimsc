--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The key is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, so I think I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let me jot down the reactions as per the description.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Let me think about each reaction. Maybe starting with the first one.

Reaction 1: A + 8B → C (bright red)
What solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product? I'm thinking metals reacting with halogens maybe. For example, sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) react in a certain ratio. Wait, but sodium is a solid, and chlorine is a gas.

Wait, sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. But what about the ratio? Let's see, sodium has a valency of 1, chlorine of 1 as well (since it's diatomic, each atom has valency 1). So for each Na, you need one Cl2 molecule? Wait, no, NaCl forms when Na (solid) reacts with Cl2 (gas) in a 2:1 ratio? No, wait, the reaction is 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. So moles of NaCl are 2 per Cl2. So that's 1 mole of Cl2 gives 2 moles of NaCl.

But in reaction 1, A is solid, B is gas, and the ratio is 8 equivalents of B to A. So if A is Na, then B would be Cl2, and the product C would be NaCl. But 8 equivalents of Cl2 for 1 mole of A (Na)? That doesn't add up. Because 2 moles of Na react with 1 mole of Cl2. So if A is Na, 8 moles of Cl2 would require 16 moles of Na. But in the reaction, A is 1 mole, and B is 8, so 1 mole A reacts with 8 moles B. So if A is Na, each mole would need 0.5 moles of Cl2. But here it's 8 times as much. That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Let me think about other reactions. Another possibility is the formation of a compound where the metal has a higher valency. For example, maybe it's aluminum reacting with chlorine. Aluminum has a valency of 3, so for each mole of Al, you need 3/2 moles of Cl2. But that might not fit either.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a transition metal. Oh, wait! What about sulfur reacting with something? Sulfur is bright yellow, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. Iron reacts with chlorine to form FeCl3. Let's see: Fe (solid) reacts with Cl2 (gas). The reaction is 2Fe + 3Cl2 → 2FeCl3. So the ratio is 3 moles Cl2 per 2 moles Fe. So for 1 mole Fe, 1.5 moles Cl2. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) for 1 A. So 8 times more than 1.5 would be 12. That's a big number. Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is not Cl2. Let me think of other gases. Could B be O2? Then reaction would be like metal + O2 → oxide. But the product C is bright red, which makes me think of something like CuO perhaps? No, CuO is black. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction of a metal with another gas, perhaps.

Wait another angle: the product C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. So C is possibly an oxide, maybe.

If C is an oxide, then reacting with water would produce an acid and perhaps a base, but since F and G are acids, maybe C is a metal oxide. So, if C is a metal oxide, it could be something like Na2O, Al2O3, or maybe something else.

Wait, when a metal oxide reacts with water, it typically forms the corresponding hydroxide, but in some cases, like with nonmetals, it can form acids. For example, SO3 is an acid anhydride. So if C is SO3, then reacting with water would form H2SO4 (acid F) and maybe another acid? But that doesn't make sense because SO3 is an anhydride of H2SO4. Wait, but the reaction would be SO3 + H2O → H2SO4.

Hmm, but the question states that C with water produces A, F, and G. So A is recovered, which suggests that reaction is a decomposition. So perhaps C is a salt? No, if C is a salt, it wouldn't react with water to form A and acids. Maybe C is a sulfide or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate or sulfide? Or maybe a nitride? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, releases A and two acids.

Let me think of a possible reaction: For example, if A is sodium (Na), and B is sulfur (S8). Then, reaction 1 would be Na + S → Na2S. But the product is bright red. Na2S is a white solid, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is S. The reaction would produce FeS, which is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a metal sulfide. But no, those are typically black or dark in color. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is copper and B is something. Copper reacting with a gas... like sulfur? So, 8 equivalents of B (sulfur) with A (copper) would form CuS? But CuS is black. Alternatively, if it's CuO, but that's from reaction with O2, not a gas like S.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an alkali metal, and B is a diatomic gas. Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is sodium and B is chlorine. Reaction 1: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. So 1 mole of Na reacts with 0.5 moles of Cl2. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. So 8 moles Cl2 would require 16 moles Na. But in the reaction, 2 Na per Cl2, so 16 Na would need 8 Cl2. So that fits. So product C would be NaCl.

Wait, but NaCl is a white solid. The problem states product C is bright red. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Let's think of other reactions. What about a reaction that forms a bright red solid. Maybe it's a transition metal compound. For example, Fe(III) oxide is reddish, but it's actually more of a dark red. Alternatively, MnO2 is dark brown.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is I2. No, I2 is dark purple, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound, but those are usually colorless or have other colors.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur compound. Wait, if A is a metal and B is S8, then perhaps they react to form a sulfide. But again, sulfides are typically black.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and carbon dioxide? For example, magnesium reacts with CO2 to form MgO and C. But MgO is white.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and nitrogen. For example, Fe reacts with N2 in the presence of certain conditions to form FeN, but I'm not sure about the color.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's look at reaction 3. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, if C is an anhydride of two different acids, then reacting with water would form those acids. For example, if C is SO3 (sulfur trioxide), then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Wait, SO3 is the anhydride of H2SO4, but how would that produce two acids?

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. Or maybe C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, but when it reacts with water, it just forms the hydroxide and CO2, which isn't an acid.

Wait, another angle: if C is a nitride, like AlN, then reacting with water would produce NH3 (a weak base, not acid) and Al(OH)3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. Wait, but in that case, hydrolysis would produce a single acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfonamide or something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Let me think about reaction 4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B are gases, reacting to form a solvent. Common solvents could be something like ethanol, water, maybe diethyl ether, etc. But since D and B are gases, perhaps they are H2O and another gas.

Wait, but H is a solvent. Let's say H is H2O. Then D and B would combine to form H2O. So, if B is O2, D could be H2. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1, so H2 and O2 in 2:1 ratio, but that's 2 H2 to 1 O2. So maybe not. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is H2? Hmm, I don't think H2 and Cl2 would form H2O; that would require some catalyst and maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. For example, if H is NH3, then D and B could be H2 and N2, but 1:1 ratio. The reaction would be N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. But that's 1 N2 to 3 H2, which is a 1:3 ratio. So not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH4? But what gases D and B would react to form CH4? Maybe CO and H2? But that's more of a Fischer-Tropsch process. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like ethanol. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of common solvents made from gases. Another possibility is H being CO2, but that's a gas itself, not a solvent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps H is HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, but HCl can be a solvent in some contexts. Alternatively, maybe H is a solution, but that doesn't fit as a product.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diethyl ether or something similar, but that would require reactants like ethanol, which are liquids, not gases.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try another angle. Let's look at reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

E is extremely hazardous. Maybe it's something like sarin gas, or perhaps a nerve agent, but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps it's a very toxic gas, like HCN or something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of a reaction between C and D. Wait, C is the product from reaction 1, which is A + 8B → C.

If I can figure out what C is, perhaps that would help. Let me think of possible C candidates.

Another approach: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C must be a compound that, upon hydrolysis, gives two acids.

If C is an anhydride of two acids, like say, a mixed anhydride, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, then reacting with water would give 2NaOH and CO2. But that would produce a base (NaOH), not two acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, wait. What if C is a sulfonate ester? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate ester, but that's speculative.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate ester, but that again doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, AlN. When AlN reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Al(OH)3. NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. For example, SiC. When SiC reacts with water, it can produce SiO2 and CH4, but that's not acids.

Hmm, I'm stuck on that. Maybe I should think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2, D is H2. Then, H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent in the traditional sense. Unless it's dissolved in water, but that's hydrochloric acid, which is a strong acid. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So maybe that's not it.

Wait another thought: maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, H would be H2O. But the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So in this case, the ratio is 2:1. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit. Unless it's another reaction. Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, B could be N2 and D could be H2. The reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. So the ratio is 1:3, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe H is CO2. But then, what reaction between two gases would produce CO2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is a solvent like ethanol. But how would that form from two gases? Ethanol is produced via Fischer-Tropsch, but that's from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which are gases. The reaction is CO + 2H2 → CH3OH. But that's methanol. For ethanol, it's more complex. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a gas used as a solvent, like Cl2? No, Cl2 is a gas and not typically a solvent. Alternatively, maybe H is a solution of something, but that's not a pure solvent.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of common solvents that can be formed from reactions of two gases. One such possibility might be H2O, but as I thought earlier, the stoichiometry doesn't fit. Another is NH3, but again the stoichiometry doesn't match.

Wait, another angle: E is extremely hazardous. What reactions produce dangerous substances?

For example, if C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen, perhaps their reaction could produce a dangerous compound. Or maybe C is a dihalide and D is another gas.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine (Cl2), so reaction 1 would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. So 1 mole of Na reacts with 0.5 moles of Cl2. But in the problem, 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So 8 moles Cl2 would require 16 moles Na. That doesn't fit the 2:1 ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is K (potassium), and B is Cl2. Then, 2K + Cl2 → 2KCl. Again, same issue.

Wait, maybe B is not Cl2 but another diatomic gas, like O2. Then, reaction 1 is A (metal) + O2 → metal oxide.

If A is Na and B is O2, then 2Na + O2 → Na2O. The product Na2O is a white solid. But the problem says C is bright red.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the oxide is colored. For example, MnO is brown, CuO is black, FeO is black, Fe2O3 is reddish. Oh, Fe2O3 is a reddish solid. So if C is Fe2O3, then when it reacts with water, it would form Fe(OH)3 and perhaps some acid? Wait, no, Fe2O3 reacts with water to form Fe(OH)3, which is a reddish-brown solid. But the product is A (Fe?), and two acids F and G.

Wait, but Fe2O3 is an oxide, so when it reacts with water, it's more like hydrolysis to form the hydroxide. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate.

Wait, if C is Fe2(SO4)3, then reacting with water would just give Fe^3+ ions and SO4^2- ions. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, gives two different acids. For example, if C is a sulfite ester or something.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. If C is Na2CO3, then reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base) and CO2 (a weak acid). But in the problem statement, F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, like RSO3-O-R'. But that's getting complicated, and I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then reacting with water would just give Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. Not two acids.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about reaction 3 again: C + H2O → A + F + G. So two acids are produced. That suggests that C has acidic protons when it reacts with water. So C could be an anhydride.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulfate anhydride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a sulfonic acid anhydride, but that's getting too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two different anhydrides. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look at reaction 4 again. D and B form H, which is a solvent. If H is a common solvent like ethanol or water, what gases could react to form them?

Wait, another idea: if H is a solution, perhaps it's a mixture. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a diethyl ether. Diethyl ether is a solvent, but it's made from ethanol via dehydration, which would involve a solid catalyst. But that's not from two gases.

Wait, another thought: perhaps H is an alkyne or something, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think of E. E is extremely hazardous. So what could E be?

If reaction 2 is C + 2D → E, and E is dangerous, perhaps it's a toxic gas like HCN, or a nerve agent, or something like phosgene (COCl2).

Wait, phosgene is a toxic gas, but how would that form? It's produced from CO and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst. So if D is Cl2 and B is CO, but then reaction 4: D (Cl2) reacts with B (CO) in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. But Cl2 and CO would form phosgene, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent like sarin. Sarin is produced from a reaction involving phosphorus compounds. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe E is something like mustard gas. But that's a sulfur-based compound.

Wait, let's think about the reaction conditions. If C is a metal oxide and D is a halogen, perhaps their reaction produces a halide. But I'm not sure that would be extremely hazardous.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride and D is a halogen, producing a hazardous compound like HCN or something else.

Wait, another idea: perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine dioxide (ClO2), which is a toxic oxidizing agent. So if C is ClO and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure about the reactions.

Alternatively, maybe E is a product of a reaction between C and D which is a diatomic gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a product of a reaction between C (an oxide) and D (a halogen). For example, CO (carbon monoxide) and Cl2 could form phosgene, but earlier I thought that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and D is a halide, but that's unclear.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to think of specific compounds that fit each reaction.

Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assumption 1: Let's say A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine (Cl2). Then reaction 1: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 for 1 mole of Na would mean 8 moles Cl2 to 1 mole Na. But the balanced equation requires 2 moles Na to 1 mole Cl2. So 8 moles Cl2 would require 16 moles Na. So that's 16:8 = 2:1. So that doesn't fit the 1:8 ratio. So perhaps A is not Na.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a different metal. Let's say A is aluminum (Al), B is Cl2. Reaction: 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. So 1 mole Al reacts with 1.5 moles Cl2. But in the problem, 8 moles Cl2 per mole A. That would mean 8 moles Cl2 to 1 mole Al. So according to the reaction, 1.5 moles Cl2 per 2 moles Al → 3 moles Cl2 per 4 moles Al. So 8 moles Cl2 would require (8 *4)/3 ≈ 10.666 moles Al. But this seems to require a lot, and the ratio in the problem is 8. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Wait, another thought: if B is O2, then reaction 1 is A (metal) + O2 → metal oxide. The product is bright red. Maybe the oxide is Fe2O3·nH2O, which is reddish. So C is Fe2O3. Then reaction 3: Fe2O3 + H2O → Fe(OH)3 + ? No, Fe2O3 + 3H2O → 2Fe(OH)3. But in this case, it would produce only Fe(OH)3, which is a base. But the problem states that two acids are formed. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let's say A is sulfur, but then reaction 1 would be S reacting with a gas. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: since C reacts with water to form two acids, perhaps C is a carbonate. But I don't think that's the case because carbonates react to form bases and CO2.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, then reacting with water would produce 2NaOH and H2SO3 (sulfurous acid). But NaOH is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of E and its structure. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups from molecular point group theory. So I need to determine the structure of E to find its symmetry.

The possible groups:

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis plus horizontal mirror planes.
- D∞h: infinite symmetry, like a linear molecule with multiple mirror planes and a main C∞ axis.
- C2v: has a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.

So, knowing the structure of E would allow me to determine its symmetry. Let's think: which extremely hazardous product E could have one of these symmetry groups.

If E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, O2, etc., its symmetry group would be D∞h. For example, O2 is diatomic with D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is also D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule like NO2, which has a bent structure, its symmetry would be C2v.

Wait, phosgene (O=CCl2) is a tetrahedral molecule, but I'm not certain about its symmetry. Wait, phosgene has a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. Its structure is planar, but with the substituents arranged as O=C(Cl)2. So the molecule is planar with a C2 axis (180-degree rotation), and mirror planes. So its point group is D∞h? Or maybe D2h? Wait, no, D∞h is for linear molecules with infinite symmetry.

Wait, another thought: if E is a linear molecule, like HCN, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is a molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

But earlier I thought E is phosgene, which is O=CCl2, which is planar but not linear. Let me think: O=C(Cl)2 has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar, so its symmetry group would be D∞h? No, wait. For a planar molecule with a central atom and two identical substituents, the point group is D∞h only if it's linear. If it's bent, like water, it's C2v. But O=C(Cl)2 is linear, right? Because the two Cl's are on opposite sides. Wait, no. Wait, no, in O=C(Cl)2, the structure is trigonal planar, but with two Cl atoms on one side and O on the other. Wait, no, the molecule is actually linear. Because the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms, making a structure like O=C(Cl)2, which is linear.

Wait, no, wait. Carbon has four bonds. So in phosgene, the structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is planar but not linear. Because each Cl is attached to the carbon, which is also attached to O. So the molecule is arranged in a trigonal planar geometry but is linear in the sense that the O and the two Cl are in a straight line. No, wait, no. Let me think: the structure is actually trigonal planar, but with the O and two Cl in a plane. So it's a trigonal planar arrangement, which would have a C2v symmetry. Because a trigonal planar molecule with a mirror plane perpendicular to the central axis and a C2 axis would have C2v symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule is linear, like CO2, which is O=C=O, then it's linear with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, another possibility: if E is sarin, which is a more complex molecule. But I'm not familiar with its symmetry.

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, then it's D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Cl2 is a hazardous gas but not the most extremely so. Phosgene is a very dangerous gas, and it's O=CCl2. So if E is phosgene, what's its symmetry group?

Phosgene has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is planar, with the O on one side and two Cl on the other. So the structure is linear if you consider O=C(Cl)2 as a straight line. Wait, no, actually, the two Cl atoms are on opposite sides of the central carbon. So the molecule is linear, like O=C(Cl)-Cl, but that's not possible because carbon can't have three bonds. Wait, no, the actual structure is O=C(Cl)2, which is planar but not linear. So the molecule is trigonal planar, but with two Cl atoms and an O. So the molecule is not linear.

In that case, the symmetry group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and two mirror planes perpendicular to the C2 axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is D3h symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: if E is a linear molecule, like HCN, which has D∞h symmetry. Because HCN is H-C≡N, which is linear. So the point group is D∞h.

But how would HCN form from C and D? Let me think.

If C is carbon, but that seems unlikely as C is a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO, which is a gas. CO has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO, then the symmetry group is D∞h. But would that fit the reactions?

Wait, but let's see. If C is CO2 and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a triatomic molecule like NO2, which has a bent structure and belongs to the C2v group.

Wait, NO2 has a bent structure with a central nitrogen. The molecule has a C2 axis (perpendicular to the molecule's long axis) and two mirror planes, so its point group is C2v.

If E is NO2, which is a toxic gas, then its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would E form from C and D?

Let me try to fit the reactions.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)

Assume A is something that when reacts with B, produces a bright red product. Let's say A is Fe (iron), B is S (sulfur). Then Fe + S → FeS, which is black. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is S. Cu + S → CuS, which is black.

Hmm.

Wait, if A is Fe, B is O2. Reaction: Fe + O2 → FeO (which is black, not red). Fe2O3 is reddish. But to get Fe2O3, you need more O2. The reaction would be 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3.

But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So for 1 mole Fe, 8 moles O2. The reaction requires 3/4 O2 per Fe. So 8 is way more than needed. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide, but that doesn't fit the color.

Alternatively, maybe A is carbon and B is something else. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think of E and then work backwards.

Assume E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or HCN.

If E is CO2, how would it form from C and D? Let's think.

CO2 is formed from combustion, perhaps. If C is CO, and D is O2, then CO + O2 → CO2. But that's an oxidation reaction. But in the problem, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E.

So, if C is CO, D is O2, then reaction would be 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. So 2 CO + 1 O2 → 2 CO2. So the ratio is 2:1. But the problem says 2 equivalents of D. So for 1 mole of C, 2 moles of D. So the ratio is 1:2 C:D. But in the reaction above, it's 2:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something else. Let's think of another D∞h molecule: HCN. How would that form?

HCN can be formed in reactions involving cyanide and water, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Another possibility: D is O2, and C is CO. Then, reaction 2 would be CO + O2 → CO2. Which is the same as before.

But again, the stoichiometry doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, like Cl2. So E is Cl2. How would that form?

If C is ClO (chlorine monoxide) and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: reaction 4 is D + B → H, which is a solvent. If H is H2O, then D and B could be H2 and O2. But the ratio is 2:1 for hydrogen and oxygen. So doesn't fit 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, which is a solvent. Then D and B would be H2 and N2. The reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. So the ratio is 3:1 H2:N2. Not 1:1.

Hmm. This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to think of E as phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a C2v symmetry group. Because earlier I thought O=CCl2 is planar and has C2v symmetry.

So if E is phosgene, which has C2v symmetry (option D), then maybe that's the answer.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

So if E is O=CCl2, then D might be Cl2 and C could be CO.

Reaction 2 would be CO + 2 Cl2 → O=CCl2 + HCl? Wait, I'm not sure about the actual reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between CO and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst to form phosgene and HCl.

But I'm not too familiar with the exact stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O and D is CO. So Cl2O + CO → 2 O=CCl2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is something else.

This is getting too speculative. Let me try to think again.

If E has D∞h symmetry, it would likely be a linear molecule. Which extremely hazardous product is linear? Phosgene is not linear, but CO is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO, how would that form?

But CO is a product of incomplete combustion, but how would it form from C and D?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like Cl2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → Cl2.

But D would have to be a source of Cl. For example, if D is HCl, then reaction would be C + 2 HCl → Cl2 + something. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another chloride.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe I should focus on the possible symmetry groups and the options.

Wait, the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, then it's either D∞h (like O2, Cl2) or D2h (like O3 is not diatomic, so irrelevant).

Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule like NO2, which is bent, then it's C2v (option D).

So, considering that, if E is NO2, which is a toxic gas, then its symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But how does that fit the reactions?

Let me try to see.

Assume E is NO2.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → NO2.

So, what could C and D be?

If D is O2 and C is NO, then reaction would be NO + O2 → NO2. But that's typically 4 NO + 3 O2 → 2 N2O5, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide and D is another gas. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NO and D is O2. So 4 NO + 3 O2 → 2 N2O5. But that doesn't fit the 2 equivalents of D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2. So for 2 D (O2), 1 C (NO) → 2 E (NO2). So if the ratio is 2 D per C, that fits.

In that case, reaction 2 would be 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2.

So D is O2, and C is NO.

Then, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (NO).

What would A and B be to produce NO?

NO is formed from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen. For example, under high temperature, N2 and O2 can react to form NO, but it's a slow reaction.

So reaction 1 could be N2 + O2 → 2 NO. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (O2) for 1 A (N2). So 1 mole N2 reacts with 8 moles O2. But the balanced equation is N2 + O2 → 2 NO. So 1 mole N2 requires 1 mole O2. But in the problem, 8 times as much O2 is used. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let's think of reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G.

If C is NO, reacting with water would produce HNO2 (nitrous acid, weak acid) and NH3 (weak base). But the problem states that F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is SO3, then reacting with water gives H2SO4 (strong acid F) and H2SO3 (weak acid G, but actually it's not that weak). But I'm not sure. Wait, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. But that's a single acid. So perhaps if C is a mixed anhydride, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. Wait, no, that would produce a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride. Then, reacting with water would produce HCl (strong acid) and another acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, NaNO3. Reacting with water would just produce Na+ and NO3^- ions. Not two acids.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, which upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. But this is getting too specific and I'm not certain.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck on identifying C, which is necessary to proceed. Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assumption:

1. E has a molecular symmetry group of D∞h (option C), which is linear. So E is a linear molecule like O2 or HCN.

But let's say E is HCN. Then, what's the structure? H-C≡N is linear, so D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

If E is HCN, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → HCN.

So, what could C and D be?

HCN can be produced from the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids, but in this case, D is a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps C is NH3 and D is a gas that reacts with it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a planar structure and C2v symmetry (option D). So the symmetry group is C2v.

If E is phosgene, then reaction 2 is C + 2 D → phosgene.

Phosgene can be produced from the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but that's not involving gases.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO and D is Cl2. Then, phosgene could form via the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions. For example, in the presence of a catalyst, CO and Cl2 might react to form phosgene and HCl. So reaction would be CO + 2 Cl2 → O=CCl2 + 2 HCl. So that would fit the 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) per C (CO).

In that case, the reaction is CO + 2Cl2 → phosgene + HCl.

So, C is CO, D is Cl2.

Then, looking back to reaction 4: D (Cl2) reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

So, Cl2 + B → H. H is a solvent. What reaction between Cl2 and B would produce a solvent?

Possibly, Cl2 + CH4 → CCl4, but CH4 is a gas? Not sure. Or Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But H2O is a solvent. Wait, but the reaction would be Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. So perhaps H is HCl or HOCl, but those are not solvents. Alternatively, perhaps B is CH4, and H is CCl4, which is a solvent. But CH4 is a gas, so reaction would be Cl2 (D) + CH4 (B) → CCl4 (H), but the stoichiometry is 1:1. The actual reaction is CH4 + 2Cl2 → CCl4 + 4HCl. So the ratio is 1:2, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. So perhaps this assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is Cl2. Then, reaction 4 would be Cl2 + O2 → H? Not sure what H would be in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas, like O3? No, O3 is not common.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is H2O (as a gas?), but that's a stretch. Then, reaction 4: Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But H is a solvent, which would be HCl or HOCl, but those are not typical solvents.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something else. Not sure.

But if I proceed with the assumption that E is phosgene (O=CCl2) with C2v symmetry, then the answer would be option D.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like HCN with D∞h symmetry, the answer would be option C.

But without knowing the exact structure of E, it's hard to decide.

Wait, another angle: the molecular symmetry group of E. If E is Cl2, which is diatomic, its point group is D∞h. So option C.

But how would Cl2 form from reaction 2, which is C + 2 D → E.

If E is Cl2, then C and D would have to combine to produce Cl2. Maybe C is ClO and D is Cl2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride and D is another chloride. Not sure.

Alternatively, reaction 2 could be the decomposition of a di-chloride.

But this is unclear.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is that E has D∞h symmetry, making option C the correct choice. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is a triatomic molecule like NO2, which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D.

Wait, given that E is extremely hazardous, and considering common dangerous chemicals, phosgene (O=CCl2) is a strong candidate. Its symmetry group, as I thought earlier, is planar and has a C2v point group. So the correct answer would be D) C2v.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests that A and B are reacting in a specific stoichiometric ratio to produce a colored compound. However, the exact identity of A, B, and C remains unclear due to insufficient information.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This indicates that E is likely a toxic or dangerous compound. Possible candidates for E include phosgene (O=CCl₂), chlorine dioxide (ClO₂), or other highly toxic substances.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests that C is likely an anhydride or a compound that releases acids upon hydrolysis. However, the exact nature of C remains ambiguous.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. This implies that D and B combine to produce a common solvent, but the exact identity of H is not explicitly determined.

### Key Analysis of E:
- If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), it is a highly toxic gas with a planar structure. Its molecular symmetry group is **C₂v**, as it has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes perpendicular to the axis.
- If E is a linear molecule like carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN), its symmetry group would be **D∞h** due to its linear geometry and infinite symmetry. However, these options do not align well with the reactions described.
- If E is a bent triatomic molecule like NO₂, its symmetry group is also **C₂v**, as it has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

### Conclusion:
Given the options and the analysis, phosgene (O=CCl₂) is the most plausible candidate for E, as it is extremely hazardous and has a **C₂v** molecular symmetry group. This aligns with the description of E and the reactions provided.

**Answer: D**
