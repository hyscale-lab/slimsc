Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with dark spots and how they affect the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

So, the setup is: there's a star with certain parameters. When it's not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, its overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Oh right, because spots are cooler regions. So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature decreases.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're asked to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”so like, the ratio when no spots (normal) divided by the ratio when spots are present.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But I think I need to be careful here. Because the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is lower. But wait, how is the photosphere's temperature affected? Oh, maybe the observed Teff is the average, so the star's total flux is lower.

But the key point is, how does this affect the ionization state of atoms and the population
