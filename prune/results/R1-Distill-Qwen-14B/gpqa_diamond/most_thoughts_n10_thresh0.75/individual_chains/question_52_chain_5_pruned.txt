Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so I remember that in stellar atmospheres, under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when spots are present. So without spots, it's higher than when there are spots. Because when the star has spots, the temperature is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). So the ratio n1/n2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). 

Wait, because n1 is the lower level, and n2 is the higher level. So if the temperature increases, the exponent becomes more negative, which makes the ratio n1/n2 smaller. Because the higher energy level becomes more populated when T is higher.

But wait, in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 should increase. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio backward. Let me think again. The ratio given is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, which is n1/n2. So the problem states that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So n1/n2 is smaller when T is lower. That doesn't make sense because if T is lower, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) would be larger, so exp(-Î”E/(kT)) would be smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller, meaning n1/n2 is larger. But according to the problem, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. So that suggests that perhaps I need to think about the reciprocal or that maybe the energy difference is negative somehow.

Wait,
