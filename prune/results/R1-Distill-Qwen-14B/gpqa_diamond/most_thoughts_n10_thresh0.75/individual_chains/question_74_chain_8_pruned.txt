Okay, so I have this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my understanding, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that there's an atom which has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, the way the problem is phrased, it says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. I think that's referring to the probability that the atom will decay in that time, but I'm not entirely sure.

So, the question continues: 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, the next 150 after the 50 minutes? Or is it after the initial 100? Wait, let me read it again.

Wait, no, the initial setup is that 50 minutes have passed since we started monitoring, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh wait, no. Wait, the question says, after 50 minutes have passed, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? Or is it the total time from the start being 150 minutes? Wait, the way the question is phrased: So far, 50 minutes have passed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So, the next 150 minutes after the 50 have passed. But wait, that would make the total time 200 minutes. Hmm, but the initial given is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me restate the problem. The given data is that the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes. So, if we had an ensemble of such atoms, 32% would have decayed by 100 minutes. But here, we're tracking a single atom, and 50 minutes have passed without decay. Now, the question is, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but how does that fit into the model. I think radioactive
