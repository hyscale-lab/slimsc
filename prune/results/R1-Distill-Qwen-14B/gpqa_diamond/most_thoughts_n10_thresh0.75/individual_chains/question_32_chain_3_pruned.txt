Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm. Let's see. The nucleus is X, which is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, wait. Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because the atomic number is 3 (protons) and mass number is 3 +3 =6.

So the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I think this is a relativistic energy problem. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. So v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. Then 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let's see. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, but maybe I should compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately. Hmm, 0.28 is exact because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, maybe I can compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact fractions. Let me think. 0.96 is 24/25. So (24/25)^2 is 576/625. Then 1 - 576/625 = (625-576)/625 = 49/625. So sqrt(49/625) is 7/25 = 0.28. So yeah, everything checks out.

So gamma is 1/(7/25) ) =25/7 ≈3.57142857. So about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So the mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus. Lithium has an atomic number Z=3, so 3 protons. Each proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the mass of the nucleus isn't just the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate the mass as the sum of protons and neutrons, since the binding energy is much smaller compared to the rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact mass from a table would be better. Wait, wait. I think the problem expects me to use the approximate mass, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is known. Let me recall. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 amu. Wait, atomic mass units. 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.012 amu times 931.5 MeV/c² per amu.

Wait, but wait. The nucleus's mass is a little different from the atomic mass because the electrons contribute too. But in this context, maybe we can ignore that because the mass is dominated by the nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just calculate using the mass number as 6 times the proton mass,
