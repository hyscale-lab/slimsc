Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the RHIC and energy calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking for the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6 because the atomic number for Li is 3, and 3 protons plus 3 neutrons make 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is often calculated using the relativistic energy equations. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), we definitely can't use classical mechanics here. Relativity is the way to go.

First, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, E = gamma * m0 * c².

But wait, what's the rest mass of ^6Li? I think the mass number A is 6, so the atomic mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But I need to convert that into kilograms or some other unit that can give me energy in GeV.

Wait, atomic mass units can be converted to energy using the mass-energy equivalence formula. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of ^6Li is 6 * 931.5 MeV, which is 5589 MeV, or 5.589 GeV.

But wait, wait. Wait a second. No, because the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, but the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh right, but when calculating the rest mass energy for the purpose of relativistic equations, we just take the actual rest mass of the nucleus, not the sum of individual nucleons. So I should look up the exact mass of ^6Li.

Ah, but maybe for this problem, they approximate the mass as 6 u times the mass of a proton? Or perhaps they just use the average. Hmm, but I think I need the exact value. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to take the rest mass as 6 u, but wait, let's think. 

Wait, the exact rest mass energy for ^6Li is probably provided, but since it's not given, I'll proceed with 6 u, but I should double-check the calculations.

Wait no, no. Wait, a lithium nucleus (Li-6) has a mass of about 6.013 atomic mass units. Because the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating the mass: 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(
