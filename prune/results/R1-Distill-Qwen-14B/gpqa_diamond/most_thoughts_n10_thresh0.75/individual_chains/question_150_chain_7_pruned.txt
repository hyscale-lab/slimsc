Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what we have here. The question gives a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and we need to find the final product from the options.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound using the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about the possible structures. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic compound since the NMR shows several aromatic signals.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. A triplet at that region might be an aromatic proton, maybe adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Like a proton ortho to a nitro group, but then again, nitro is O and N, but our formula has N and O. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO, so that's one N and one O. So maybe it's a nitro group? But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton. Oh wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but aldehydes are deshielded. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton with something else. Let me think: a triplet at 9.7 ppm... Could it be a para-substituted aromatic ring with something else attached? Not sure yet.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. So maybe two equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted ring. The downfield shift suggests some de-shielding, maybe near an electron-withdrawing group.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Maybe another set of aromatic protons, perhaps in another ring or adjacent to a substituent.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad signals can be tricky. Maybe these are protons in a conjugated system, like an enol or something with exchange broadening. Or maybe they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenolic OH, but the integration is 2H. Wait, but the description says 'bs' which is broad singlet. Alternatively, maybe they're in a conjugated diene or part of a ring with substituents.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. That's around where CH2 groups attached to something electronegative (like O) would appear. Maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen? Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The doublet suggests two neighboring protons. So maybe it's a -CH2-CH2- group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH2O structure, but that might not fit the formula. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So maybe
