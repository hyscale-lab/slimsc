Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are usually angular momentum operators. Oh wait, wait. Because the components (Px, Py, Pz) are given, and they look familiar. Let me think. Oh right, these are the components of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator P must be the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon.

The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the direction here is arbitrary, but it's in the x-z plane. That probably means the direction vector n has some angles θ and φ. Wait, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, right? Because the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0 for spherical coordinates. So, n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

Wait, no, for direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0, so the direction would be along the x and z components. So, the unit vector n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Or maybe I should think in terms of the spherical angles. Anyway, perhaps it's easier to construct the operator P·n, because the eigenvalue problem involves the operator in the direction of n.

Oh right, because the operator for the component along an arbitrary direction n is given by P · n. So, P · n = Px * n_x + Py * n_y + Pz * n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, the operator simplifies to Px * n_x + Pz * n_z.

Let me write down the given components. Px is ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Py is ħ/2 * [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Pz is ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, P · n would be (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Wait, because n is a unit vector, right? So n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. Since in x-z plane, n_y=0.

So, combining these terms, the matrix becomes:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, we set up the equation (P·n - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write this matrix equation. Let me denote the matrix as M = (P·n)/(ħ/2) = [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].
