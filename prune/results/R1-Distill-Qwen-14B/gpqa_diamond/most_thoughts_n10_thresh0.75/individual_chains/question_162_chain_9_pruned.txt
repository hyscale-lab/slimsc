Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx² and dy², so it's probably describing a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe like a sphere or something else.

I remember that in general relativity, the metric can describe the geometry of spacetime, but here it's probably a static two-dimensional space. So the area would be computed using the metric. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, like a hyperbolic surface. In contrast, a regular sphere has positive curvature.

The area of a sphere in two dimensions is 4πr², but pseudospheres are different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pseudosphere is a term sometimes used for the tractricoid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a surface with constant negative curvature, so the metric here might represent such a space.

Wait, the metric given is in terms of x and y. Let me see the denominator: 4 - x² - y². Oh, that looks similar to the metric of a sphere. Because for a sphere of radius 2, the denominator would be 4 - (x² + y² + z²), but here we have only x and y, so maybe it's a
