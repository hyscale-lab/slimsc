Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here. So the problem gives me a decay process: X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The setup in the Bubble Chamber has an energy of 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when particles are moving, their lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime, τ, depends on the particle's velocity and the energy. The resolution, I think, refers to the measurement precision needed to detect the decay products. So we need to find the minimum resolution (like the minimum distance between the decay products) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, but how does the resolution relate to the lifetime and the speed of the particle? Oh, right! The lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime because of time dilation. The distance the particle travels before decaying is called the decay length. The decay length L is the velocity of the particle multiplied by the observed lifetime τ. L = v * τ.

But since τ is longer than τ₀, L will be longer than v * τ₀. So the decay length is a crucial factor because if the decay length is too small, the tracks from Y⁺ and Z⁻ might be too close together, making it difficult to resolve them. So the minimum resolution would be the minimum distance between the two decay products that allows them to be detected separately. That distance would be the decay length times some fraction, maybe.

Wait, the question is about observing at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps 30% of the particles' decay lengths are longer than the resolution. Or maybe the resolution needs to be at least such that 30% of the decays are observed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Let me think about the variables involved. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given, and the energy is given as 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So first, I need to compute the velocity of X⁰, because the lifetime observed (τ) depends on velocity.

Wait, the lifetime τ is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor gamma. So τ = gamma * τ₀. And gamma is E / (m c²), since for a relativistic particle, E is approximately gamma m c². So let me compute gamma.

Wait, E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) but since the units are in GeV and GeV/c², I can ignore the c² term because when you compute gamma, the units should work out. So gamma = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = approximately 27 / 3.41
