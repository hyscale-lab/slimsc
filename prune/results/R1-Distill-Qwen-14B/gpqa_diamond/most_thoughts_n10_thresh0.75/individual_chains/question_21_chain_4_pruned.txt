Okay, so I have this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the structural arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements.

Now, the question is asking two parts, labeled A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism. I need to figure out which of these compounds doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is about compounds having stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to different optical rotations.

First, tackling Part A.

Benzoquinone: I remember that benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone can exist in two forms, para and ortho, depending on the positions of the oxygen atoms. Wait, but wait, does it have any acidic hydrogens that can undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of electrons, like in enols and ketones. Quinones have conjugated carbonyl groups. For tautomerism, you usually need a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In benzoquinone, the ring has two keto groups. Let me visualize it: the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the 1,2 (ortho) or 1,4 (para) positions. Wait, no—actually, benzoquinone can have two carbonyl groups either adjacent (ortho) or across from each other (para). Wait, but in either case, each carbonyl is part of a six-membered ring. So, each oxygen is double-bonded to the ring. Are there any hydrogens attached to the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups?

In the structure of para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at position 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5) would have hydrogens. So, can those hydrogens tautomerize? Tautomerism would involve the hydrogen moving from, say, a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl to another position, changing the structure from a keto form to an enol form.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the structure is more like O=C6H4=O. So the ring has two carbonyl groups. Each of these carbonyl groups is connected to a benzene ring. So, each of the carbons next to the carbonyl (the ones attached to the ring) have hydrogens. So, for example, the ring is O=C–C6H4–C=O. The adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the carbonyl groups) are each attached to a CH group. So, each of
