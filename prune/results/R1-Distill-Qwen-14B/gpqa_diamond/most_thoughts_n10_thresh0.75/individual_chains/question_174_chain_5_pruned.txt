Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the problem is about nuclear fission and calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, both relativistically and classically, and then finding the difference between the two. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

So, the initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then, it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so M_initial is the mass of the original nucleus, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses that add up to 0.99*M.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M_initial c² is 300 GeV. Then, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99*M_initial. So each fragment's rest mass is a part of this 0.99*M.

Let me denote the two fragments as fragment 1 and 2. Let’s say fragment 1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2*m2. Because fragment 1 is twice as massive as fragment 2.

So m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. Since m1 = 2*m2, that becomes 2m2 + m2 = 3m2. So 3m2 = 0.99*M. So m2 = 0.99*M / 3 = 0.33 M. And m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. M_initial is the rest mass of the original nucleus. After fission, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M_initial. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M_initial. And m1 = 2 m2.

So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M /3. So that's correct.

Now, when the nucleus fissions, energy is released because the binding energy is higher in the initial nucleus than the sum of the fragments. So the mass defect is M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M.
