Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question gives me the state |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. I remember that the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian states. But when you have such a superposition with a phase phi, it becomes non-Gaussian, right?

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha^2)). Oh wait, when phi is -pi/4, sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2), which is -1. And exp(-2alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25))=exp(-0.5). So let me compute that: sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)).

Wait, let's calculate that value. Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2phi) is -1, so it's 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065=0.3935. The square root of 0.3935 is about 0.6275. So N is approximately 0.6275.

But wait, what's the form of the state? It's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Since phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) which is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 | -0.5> ] / N.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, wait. I think I might be confusing the formula.
