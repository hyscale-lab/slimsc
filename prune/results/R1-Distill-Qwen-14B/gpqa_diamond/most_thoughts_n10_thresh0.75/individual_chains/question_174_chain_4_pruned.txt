Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

First, let's outline what's given:

- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV (so M = 300 GeV / c², but since units are in GeV, maybe we can ignore c² for energy calculations here, but I'm not sure yet).

- After fission, two fragments: let's say their rest masses are m and 2m. Because one is twice the other.

- The sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → M = 3m / 0.99. Wait, let me compute that. So m = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M. So the more massive fragment is 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, no: 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M, so the other fragment is 0.66 M.

So fragment 1 (mass 0.66 M) and fragment 2 (0.33 M). They move in opposite directions with velocities v1 and v2, but their momenta must cancel each other as the initial momentum is zero.

So momentum p1 = γ1 * m1 * v1, p2 = γ2 * m2 * v2.

But since p1 = -p2, we have γ1 m1 v1 = γ2 m2 v2.

Wait, but in the rest frame of the nucleus, the total momentum after fission must be zero.

So the two fragments' momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Hmm, but for non-relativistic speeds, momentum is m v, but relativistic momentum is gamma m v. So in the non-relativistic case, the velocities are small, so gamma is approximately 1.

But in the relativistic case, gamma might be significant, so we can't ignore it.

The question is about the difference between the correct T1 (which includes relativistic effects) and the non-relativistic approximation.

So, first, perhaps I should calculate the velocities of the two fragments in both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases, find the kinetic energies, and then find the difference.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

First, considering the rest frame of the nucleus.

Energy before fission: just the rest energy, which is Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, each fragment has rest energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy after is (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2) = (m1 + m2)c² + (T1 + T2).

But wait, the initial energy is Mc², so:

Mc² = (m1 + m2) c² + (T1 + T2).

Which gives T1 + T2 = (M - (m1 + m2)) c².

But wait, M is the initial rest mass. The sum m1 + m2 is 0.99 M, so:

T1 + T2 = (1 - 0.99) M c² = 0.01 M c².

Since M c² is 300 GeV, then T1 + T2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

So together, the kinetic energies add up to 3 GeV.

But we're interested in T1, which is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (0.66 M).

I think the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the T1 calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approach.

So perhaps I should model both the relativistic and non-relativistic scenarios, compute T1 in each, subtract them, and see which option matches.

But wait, how to find T1?

In the non-relativistic case, we can model this using conservation of momentum and energy.

In non-relativistic:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because the initial momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, no, wait, m1 and m2 are rest masses, but in the non-relativistic case, mass is invariant, so m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Wait, no, wait, M is the initial mass, which is the sum of the rest masses plus binding energy, I think. Oh but wait the problem says that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial rest mass M includes binding energy. So when it splits, the rest masses of the fragments sum to 0.99 M, implying that the binding energy (or mass defect) is 1% of M.

So in the initial nucleus, rest mass is M. After fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so the binding energy is M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. This is where the kinetic energy comes from.

So the kinetic energy comes from the binding energy. So as per the rest energy, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But back to the problem.

In the non-relativistic case:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

So (0.66 M) v1 = (0.33 M) v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

Energy conservation: T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

In non-relativistic, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So:

(1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² = 3 GeV.

Substituting m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M, and v2 = 2 v1:

(1/2)(0.66 M) v1² + (1/2)(0.33 M) (2 v1)^2 = 3 GeV.

Simplify:

(0.33 M v1²) + (0.33 M)(4 v1²) ) = 3 GeV.

So 0.33 M v1² [1 + 4] = 3 GeV.

0.33 M v1² *5 =3.

So 1.65 M v1² =3 → v1² =3/(1.65 M) → v1 = sqrt(3/(1.65 M)).

Wait, but M is in GeV/c²? Or perhaps it's more about the units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the velocities using the non-relativistic approach and then find the kinetic energies.

But maybe another approach is to calculate the velocities and then find the kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps the non-relativistic case is much simpler.

Let me compute the velocities.

From momentum conservation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → 0.66 M v1 = 0.33
