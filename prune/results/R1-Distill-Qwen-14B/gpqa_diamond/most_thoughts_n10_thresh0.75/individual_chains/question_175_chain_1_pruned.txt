Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. We need to find the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also determine the possible form of f.

Wait, right. I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the angle. For a dipole antenna, for example, the radiation is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees from the axis, and it falls off as you go towards the poles. But wait, wait, what's the exact dependence?

Oh, right! The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, where θ is the angle from the dipole's axis. So maximum at θ=90 degrees, and zero at θ=0 and 180. But wait, the question is about a spheroidal distribution, which is a bit different than a pure dipole. Hmm, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's similar. Or maybe it's a quadrupole? No, wait, it's oscillating, so maybe it's acting like a dipole in terms of radiation.

Wait, but the problem says it's spheroidal, so maybe it's more like a dipole's radiation pattern. Let me think. The power radiated per unit solid angle is given by a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A, which I suppose occurs at a particular θ.

Wait, the maximum power is A. So the function f(θ) must have a maximum. Let me think about the possible form of f. Oh, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So f should be proportional to sin²θ. But wait, the options don't have sine terms; they're looking for how f depends on λ and θ.

Wait, the question says that f is a function of λ and θ. So the power per unit solid angle is f(λ, θ).
