Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So there's a planet with Earth's radius orbiting a star 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2 and an orbital period of 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with 2.5 Earth's radius. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have and still exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane needs to be aligned such that the planet's path (the orbit) crosses in front of the star from our point of view. The transit impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path passes to the center of the star. If the impact parameter is zero, the planet would pass directly in front of the star's center.

But wait, impact parameter also depends on the orbital distance. Oh right, the impact parameter 'b' is calculated as b = (R_planet + R_star) / a, where 'a' is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, actually, I think the impact parameter is given by (r_orbital * sin(i)) / (R_star), but since it's a transit, the inclination i must be 90 degrees, so sin(i)=1. Alternatively, another formula I remember is b = (R_star / a) * (1 + sqrt(1 - (d_star_planet/a)^2)), but maybe that's not the right approach here.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the transit condition. For a planet to transit, the orbital distance 'a' must be such that the planet's orbit passes in front of the star. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is when the planet just barely starts to transit. So the impact parameter 'b' can't be more than (R_star + R_planet). Wait, no, that's not right. Impact parameter 'b' is the distance in units of the star's radius, measured at the star's center, from the point where the planet's path would pass closest. So if 'b' is less than or equal to (R_planet / R_star), then the planet will transit. Wait, no,
