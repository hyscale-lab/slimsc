Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference must be sufficiently large so that the lines don't overlap when measured. How does the uncertainty in energy affect the ability to resolve them?

Oh, I think the idea is that if the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties in their energies, then we can distinguish them. Otherwise, if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, they might blend together and we can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i), where τ_i is the lifetime of state i.

So for state 1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Let me calculate ΔE1. And for state 2, τ2 is 1e-8 seconds, so ΔE2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, we need ΔE >> ΔE1 and ΔE >> ΔE2. Because if ΔE is much bigger than the uncertainties, the peaks won't overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required ΔE is the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe the larger uncertainty. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ), because the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but in the context of this question, each state has its own line width. So for state 1, the line width (full width at half maximum) is proportional to 1/τ1, and similarly for state 2.

So the two lines (from E1 and E2) will appear as two peaks. For them to be clearly resolved, the separation between the peaks must be much larger than the sum of their line widths. Otherwise, the peaks might overlap, making it hard to distinguish them.

So the separation (ΔE) should be much greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

Alternatively, if the separation is greater than the sum, then they're resolved. So let's compute the values.

First, let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2 using the uncertainty principle.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But the options are given in eV, so perhaps I should convert everything to eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9)
= 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J)
= (5.272859e-26) / (1.602e-19) eV
≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.
Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the line widths are about 3.3e-7 eV and 3.3e-8 eV.

So the separation between E1 and E2 (ΔE) needs to be much larger than the sum of these line widths, which is 3.3e-7 + 3.3e-8 = about 3.63e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 3.63e-7, so not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is way bigger than 3.6e-7. So that would satisfy the condition.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV, which is about 0.1 times 3.6e-7. So not sufficient because it's not much larger than the sum.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The condition for two peaks to be resolved is that the separation is at least a certain multiple of the sum of the uncertainties. Like, in signal processing, you usually need the separation to be more than the sum to avoid overlap. So if the separation is much larger than the sum, then yes, they are resolved.

So for the given options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So that would make them clearly distinguishable.

Option D is 1e-8 eV. Let's see, 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, and the sum is about 3.6e-7 (which is 0.36e-6). So 1e-8 is smaller than the sum, so the separation is not enough. So D isn't sufficient.

So the correct answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is inversely proportional to its lifetime, given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i},
\]

where \( \tau_i \) is the lifetime of the \( i \)-th state, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)), we calculate the uncertainties for the two states:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The total uncertainty in energy is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be much larger than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.63 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two energy levels are clearly distinguishable.
