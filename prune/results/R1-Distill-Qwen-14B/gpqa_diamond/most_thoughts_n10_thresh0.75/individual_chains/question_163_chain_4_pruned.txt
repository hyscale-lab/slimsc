Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare the solution and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and it's going to react with a strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, it probably has one H+ ion per molecule, like HCl or HNO3. The acid is 0.1 M, so concentrated enough but not super concentrated.

First, I think I need to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass is 0.1 grams. I should find its molar mass to get the number of moles.

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Wait, each OH is 17 g/mol. So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, or about 9.36e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it will undergo a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Wait, yeah, that makes sense. Each Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So moles H+ = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Now, the H+ is coming from the strong monobasic acid. The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed (V) can be found using moles = concentration × volume.

Volume V = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 28.08, but option C is 28.05 cm³. That's pretty close, so maybe that's the volume part of the answer.

But wait, the question also asks about the pH of the resulting solution. How do I approach
