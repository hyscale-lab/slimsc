Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm. I remember that uncertainty relates to the variance of the operator, so I think I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z squared and subtract the square of the expectation value of P_z.

Wait, but first, I need to find the expectation values. The system's state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). That's the state vector, which is the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So, the state is already given, and I can use it to compute the expectation values.

The formula I remember is that the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So, I'll need to compute both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal. Let me look at the P_z matrix they provided. The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), the second is (0,0,0), and the third is (0,0,-ħ). Oh wait, so the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. Interesting.

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which are probably |+z>, |0>, |-z> or something similar. Since the given state is a linear combination of these basis vectors, we can express it as a vector (a, b, c), which they have given.

The state vector is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). Let me check if the components square to 1. The squares are (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1+2+1)/4 = 4/4=1. So normalization is okay.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. The expectation value is given by the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the P_z matrix, multiplied by the state vector.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is the sum of each component of the state multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

Wait, that's right. Because when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of the operator, the expectation value is just the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues. So each element in the state is the amplitude for that eigenstate.

So, the state vector has components a, b, c. The eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * ħ + b* *0 + c* * (-ħ). Since the state is given as a column vector, the components are a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(
