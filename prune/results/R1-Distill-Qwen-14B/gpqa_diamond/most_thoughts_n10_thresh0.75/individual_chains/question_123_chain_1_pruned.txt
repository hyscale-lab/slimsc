Okay, so I've got this problem about a supernova and the distance the ejecta travels. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step. 

So the question says that a supernova occurred in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, I'm a bit confused about frames here. Oh right, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, and vice versa. So it's like two objects moving towards each other. 

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, time is different in different frames because of relativity, right? So I need to account for time dilation perhaps.

Wait, but wait, I should probably figure out the relative velocities and then find the distance. Let me see. The problem is a bit tricky because it's about relative motion and time in different frames.

First, I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, but that's in the context of classical mechanics. But here, since we're dealing with high speeds (like 60,000 km/s), relativistic effects might come into play. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation and revolution, so it's a simple relative motion problem.

Wait a second, the problem states that the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So each sees the other moving. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at the same speed, right? Because in classical terms, velocities add, but in relativity, it's more complicated. Hmm, but maybe here we can treat it classically since the problem doesn't specify high fractions of the speed of light. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.06c because c is about 300,000 km/s. So that's 6% the speed of light. Hmm, maybe we need to consider relativistic velocity addition, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem doesn't state that we should consider relativity, so maybe it's
