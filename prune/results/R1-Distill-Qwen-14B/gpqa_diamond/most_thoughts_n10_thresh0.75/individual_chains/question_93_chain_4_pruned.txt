Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let's see what I remember about qPCR and calibration curves.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly, which is ideal. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that the slope in a qPCR calibration curve relates to the efficiency. The formula is something like slope = log(E) / ln(E), but wait, when efficiency is 100%, E is 2 (because each cycle doubles the DNA), so the slope should be -3.3219... Oh wait, because the formula is (slope = -log10(E) / ln(E)) or something like that. Let me think: for E=2, log10(2) is about 0.301, and ln(2) is about 0.693. So 0.301 / 0.693 is roughly 0.434. But since the slope is negative in the context, maybe it's -3.322 because of the way the data is plotted. Oh wait, yes, when using a standard curve method, the data is plotted as Ct vs log copies, and the slope is approximately -3.322 for 100% efficiency. So the given slope of -3.3 matches that. So the efficiency part seems correct.

Looking at the data points:

At 100000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average is about 34.2, maybe. The same for the others: each has a Ct that's about 3 lower when the copies are tenfold lower. Wait, let me check: 100000 → 34-ish, then 10000 → 30s, 1000 → 27s, 100 → 24s, 10 → 20s. Each log10 reduction (factor of 10) in copy number leads to about a 3.3 Ct increase. Because each Ct is about 3.3 cycles higher for each tenfold dilution. So the data seems consistent with the expected slope.

Wait, but the question is about the "discrepancies in his results." The options are about possible explanations. But looking at the given data, the triplicates have small deviations. For example, 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The range is about 0.6 between the min and max. Similarly, other concentrations have similar ranges. So the technical replicates are quite close, which is good.

Now, the options:

Option A) qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not true. qPCR is used exactly for quantification, especially with calibration curves.

Option B) Ct values don't agree with target amount. Well, in this case, the data seems to fit perfectly since the R² is 1. So B is incorrect.

Option C) Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each tenfold dilution leads to a Ct increase of about 3.3, which is correct. So a tenfold dilution is 3.3 cycles, which matches the expectation. So C says that ten-fold is more than 3.3 cycles, but it's exactly 3.3. So why would this be the option? If the Ct increase was less than 3.3 for a tenfold, that would suggest lower efficiency. But here, it's exactly 3.3. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the option is suggesting
