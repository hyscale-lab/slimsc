Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. But wait, I think the problem says 2e, so yeah, each is 2e.

Now, 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the 12 others are each 2 meters away from P. So I can imagine them arranged around P in some way, but perhaps the exact arrangement doesn't matter because they're all at the same distance.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Hmm. Wait, the energy in an electrostatic system is the electric potential energy. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

But wait, energy in electrostatics is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Since the system is isolated, I don't think external fields are involved; it's just the potential energy between each pair.

So I should calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum them all up. Okay.

But wait, the charges are either at P or at 2m away. So let's see. There are 13 charges in total. One is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from P. So each is 2 m from the 13th charge, which is at P. But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point 2m from P, or are they arranged in some way so that their mutual distances are the same or different?

Wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 m from P. But how are they arranged relative to each other? Well, perhaps they are all placed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m around P. So each is 2 m from P, but what about the distances between the 12 charges?

Hmm, if all 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m
