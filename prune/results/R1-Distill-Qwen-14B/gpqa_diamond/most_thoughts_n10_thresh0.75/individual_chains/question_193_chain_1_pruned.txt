Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. I'm a bit rusty on my formulas, but I remember that parallax relates to distance somehow. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if plx is small, the distance is large.

The number of stars is given as proportional to 1/(plx^5). Let me write that down. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, I get N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Wait, maybe I need to think about the number of stars per unit volume or something. Oh, wait, the number of stars in a region probably depends on the volume, and volume depends on distance cubed. But here, according to the given relation, it's different.

Wait, let's clarify. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as the fifth power of d. But the question is about how N changes with distance. So for a small change in distance dr, the change in N would be dN. How does dN/dr look?

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let's say N = k * (d)^5, where k is some constant. Then the derivative dN/dr is 5k d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of d. But wait, the question is about per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the density or the change in number per unit distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of stars as a function of distance, and how that number changes as you go further. So if N ∝ d^5, then when you increase the distance from, say, d to d + dr, the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to d^5. So for each unit increase in d, the number increases by a factor of 5d^4? That would mean the change is proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of r, not d. Wait, maybe r is the distance variable here. So if r is the distance, then N ∝ r^5. So the change in N with r would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So the number of stars is increasing with r^5, so the rate of change is r^4. 

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)" So it's the change
