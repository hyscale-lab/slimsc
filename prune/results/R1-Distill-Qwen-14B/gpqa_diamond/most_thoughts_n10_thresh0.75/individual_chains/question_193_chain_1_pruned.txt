Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax relates to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Right, but how does parallax relate to distance? Oh wait, parallax (pl) is inversely proportional to distance. So pl = 1/d, where d is distance. Oh wait, actually, I think it's pl = 1/(d) in parsecs or something like that. So, if pl increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So, the number of stars N is proportional to pl^(-5), which is the same as N ∝ (d)^5, because pl is 1/d. Let me check that substitution. If pl = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx^5) becomes d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so we're looking for the number of stars as a function of distance. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases proportionally to the fifth power. But wait, the options are in terms of r, which I assume is the distance. So probably, the number of stars increases as
