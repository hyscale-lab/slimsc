Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through the question carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The setup gives me some information: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively.

The question asks by what factor is the luminosity of Star_1 greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, T must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if their temperatures are the same, and the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, then the luminosity of Star_1 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Oh wait, but wait, because T is the same, L would be proportional to R squared. So if R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1 = (1.5)^2 * L2 = 2.25 L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

Wait a second, but wait. Is there another factor I'm missing here? Because the
