Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, here the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light as observed?

Wait, no, I think the speed of light in the medium is still determined by the medium, regardless of the medium's motion. Because the speed of light in a medium is a property of the medium, not its velocity. So like, if the glass is moving, the light's speed through it depends on n. But wait, maybe I'm confusing this with something else.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving, so the lab frame and the glass's frame are in relative motion. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_medium = c/n. But from the lab frame, how does that change?

Oh, right! When a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed in the lab frame isn't just simply the same as v_medium because of the movement of the medium. Because the medium is moving towards the observer, there's a Doppler effect or some sort of addition of velocities.

Wait, but wait—no, the speed of light in a medium is actually a separate consideration. Let me think. The glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving at speed v_light = c/n relative to the glass. So, from the lab frame, what's the observed speed?

I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, is that necessary here? Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v, and the light is moving at v_light (c/n) relative to the glass. So the total speed from the lab's perspective would be v + v_light? But wait, no, because velocity addition isn't as simple as that in relativity.

Wait, but wait—special relativity's velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²). But in this case, c is 1, so the formula simplifies to (u + v)/(1 + u
