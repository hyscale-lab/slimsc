Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli vector, right? So each component of sigma is a Pauli matrix.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So the dot product sigma·n would be n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z, where n is a unit vector, meaning n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. Oh right, because it's a unit vector.

So the Hamiltonian H is epsilon multiplied by this dot product. So H is epsilon times (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues of H.

Wait, eigenvalues of a matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But since H is a 2x2 matrix, maybe there's a simpler way, especially since it's built from Pauli matrices.

I remember that each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. For example, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a general combination like sigma·n, what are the eigenvalues?

Wait, the spin matrices are related to angular momentum, right? The spin operator S is (ħ/2) sigma. Oh, wait, that's right. So S = (ħ/2) sigma. And the eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2, because S has magnitude ħ/2 and direction along n.

Wait, but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon sigma · n. So maybe I can relate it to the spin operator. Let me think: if S = (ħ/2) sigma, then sigma = 2 S / ħ.

So substituting that into H: H = epsilon (2 S · n / ħ). So H = (2 epsilon / ħ) (S · n).

But wait, S · n has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, as I thought earlier. So if I plug that in, H would have eigenvalues (2 epsilon / ħ) multiplied by ± ħ/2.

Let me calculate that: (2 epsilon / ħ)
