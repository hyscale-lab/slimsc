Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's happening step by step. So, the starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let's break that down. 

First, the structure. The main ring is a cyclohexanone (because of the -one suffix), with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group, right? So it's CH2-CH-CH2, but wait, the propene is at position 1, so it's CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. No, wait, the structure for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions.

Now, the first step is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating things. But in this case, the compound is a ketone (cyclohexanone). So maybe the ketone is getting deprotonated. But wait, ketones typically don't have acidic protons. Oh wait, maybe the hydroxymethyl group is adjacent to the carbonyl. The hydroxymethyl is a CH2OH group at position 3. So maybe the OH in CH2OH is getting deprotonated by sodium hydride, making it a better leaving group. 

Wait, but once the OH is deprotonated, it becomes an O- which is a good nucleophile. Then, benzyl bromide (which is an alkyl halide) would undergo an SN2 reaction. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, resulting in an ether formation. So the product would have a benzyl group attached to the CH2 that was previously OH. So the product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl) something. Let me visualize the structure: the cyclohexanone ring with substituents at 3 and 5. At position 3, the group is now CH2-O-Bn (benzyl) instead of CH2OH. So product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Next step: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of catalytic HCl, forming product 2. Hmm, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (tosylhydrazide) is often used in the Curtius rearrangement or in making hydrazones. Wait, but more likely, this is a nucle
