Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams is heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure. The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. I remember that when salts decompose upon heating, they often release gases. The process sounds like a decomposition reaction. The tubes probably are used to identify the gases. Let's think about the reagents in each tube.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent. Wait, but in this case, it's anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. When it absorbs water, it would gain mass. Oh wait, but the gases are passed through, so maybe tube 1 is absorbing some moisture or a specific gas. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, but under certain conditions, maybe it reacts with some gases. Wait, if the gas is water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. So if the gas mixture contains water vapor, tube 1 would gain mass. But in this case, the mass increased by 3.60 grams. So that could be the water vapor.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Wait, no, it's a solution, so it's in contact with the gas. If the gas is CO2, it would react with the Ca(OH)2 solution to form CaCO3 precipitate. But the mass of tube 2 didn't change, meaning no reaction. So no CO2 is present in the gas mixture. Or maybe the solution already had excess CO2, but more likely, no CO2 was present.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper.
