Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh right, and the options are A to D, each giving a different expression for the energy E.

Wait, I need to think step by step. Let me start by understanding the potential. So, the potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)k r squared, which reminds me of the harmonic oscillator potential in radial coordinates. The second term is (3/2)k r squared cos squared theta. Hmm, that looks like it depends on the angle theta as well.

Wait, in two dimensions, the problem is probably separable into radial and angular parts. So maybe I can treat the potential as a sum of functions that depend only on r and theta, respectively. Let me write V(r,θ) as [ (1/2)k r² ] + [ (3/2)k r² cos²θ ]. Wait, wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So, both terms depend on r squared but the second term has a cos squared theta. So perhaps I can factor out r squared?

Hmm, V(r,θ) = (k r²) [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Wait, maybe I can rewrite this in terms of angular components. Let's think about the angular part. The term involving cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in:

V(r,θ) = (k r²) [1/2 + (3/2)( (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ) ].

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute the coefficient inside the brackets:

1/2 + (3/2)*(1/2) + (3/2)*(cos 2θ)/2.

Wait, 3/2 times 1/2 is (3/4). So 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4 is 5/4. Then the cos 2θ term is (3/4) cos 2θ.

So, V(r,θ) = k r² [5/4 + (3/4) cos 2θ ].

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Another
