Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution formula is probably key here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps the ratio of the populations (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the ratios as R1 and R2. So, R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, the excitation (n_upper) is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2. Or, maybe R1 = 2. Because the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to..." So for the same level, n_upper1 is twice n_upper2, assuming the lower level is the same? Hmm, maybe I need to think this through.

Let me denote R as the ratio of the upper to lower level populations. For star_1, R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1. For star_2, R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2. The question says R1 is twice as much as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, but looking at the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since the problem states "the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38e-23 J", so ΔE is the same for both stars. Also, I think the statistical weights (g factors) are the same for the same transition, so g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars. Therefore, the ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ] = exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) )

But wait, another approach: R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, if R1 = 2 R2, then:

(R1)/(R2) = 2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T2)] - [ΔE/(k T1)] )

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(
