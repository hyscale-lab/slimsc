Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then, during titration with a strong base like NaOH, the pH changes based on how much of the base has been added.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, but after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 M * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of CH3COOH.

Wait, let me calculate the moles. The original solution after dilution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol of acetic acid.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks for pH at 25% titration and equivalence. Let's take them one by one.

For 25% titration: 25% of the equivalence volume would be 10 cm³ × 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So we're at the point where a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

In a titration, the 25% point is before the equivalence point. So the solution will consist of acetic acid and its conjugate base, sodium acetate. This is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

Wait, what's the pKa here? The Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.74 or so. Let me compute it accurately. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.74.

At 25% titration, how much of the acid has reacted? So we started with 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. Adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH: moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH reacted = 0.00025 mol, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed is 0.00025 mol.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

Now, plug into Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = 4.74 + log(1/3). Log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263.

Wait, but wait another thing. The concentrations here are in the same solution, so the volume is the same as the total solution. Let me see: the initial solution after adding 20 cm³ water was 40 cm³. Then, when 2.5 cm³ NaOH is added, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. But wait, in the Henderson equation, it's the ratio of concentrations, which depends on the moles because the volume cancels out. So the ratio is indeed 1/3, so no need to worry about the actual volume.

So pH at 25% is approximately 4.26. Let me check the options. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So that's one part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions can be calculated. At equivalence, total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation's Kb is 5.405e-10. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initially:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M
[CH3COOH] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

Equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be very small)
[CH3COOH] = x
[OH^-] = x

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

Solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10
x^2 = 1.081e-11
x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M

So [OH^-] is ~3.288e-6 M. pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. pH is 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515.

Wait, but wait another thing. I used an approximation that x is negligible compared to 0.02. Let me check if that's valid.

x is about 3.29e-6, which is 3.29e-6 / 0.02 = 1.645e-4, which is 0.016% of 0.02. So the approximation holds.

So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.515, which rounds to 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A has pH 4.26 and 8.52. So that would be the correct pair.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I make a mistake with the initial moles? Let me double-check the equivalence point.

Original acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M in 40 cm³ → 0.001 mol.

NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles needed for equivalence: 0.001 mol. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

At equivalence, the solution is 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³. So 0.02 M. Yes.

Hmm, but wait another thought. Wait, the NaOH solution is 0.1 M, and when you add 10 cm³ to 40 cm³, the total volume is 50 cm³. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. Correct.

So the pH at equivalence is about 8.51, which is 8.52 when rounded. So option A's values are 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the correct option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait! Maybe I messed up the calculations for the 25% titration. Let's recheck that.

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 10 cm³. So 2.5 cm³. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Correct.

Moles of CH3COOH originally: 0.001. After reaction, CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Acetate is 0.00025 mol. Correct.

So [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.00075) = 1/3. So pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.74 + (-0.477) = 4.263. So pH ≈4.26, as I thought.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial pH before any titration is lower than the pH after some titration? Wait no, the initial solution after dilution would have a lower concentration, so lower pH? No, wait, no. Wait, wait. No, wait, the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Its pH is lower than pure water, but higher than a more concentrated solution. For example, a 0.05 M solution would have a lower pH than 0.025 M. So after dilution, the pH would be higher than it was before. But the problem is after dilution and before titration. But the question is about after titration, so the initial solution's pH is not directly needed.

Wait, but perhaps I forgot to account for dilution in the initial calculations. No, because I considered that the initial dilution brings the concentration down to 0.025 M.

Wait, but for the equivalence point, what if I used the wrong Kb? Let me recalculate the Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.74 (as before). Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Right.

So hydrolysis:

[CH3COOH] = x
[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb = x²/(0.02) = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈3.288e-6 → pOH is about 5.48 → pH 8.52.

So the calculations seem correct.

So the correct answer should be option A, which is 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but looking at the other options, option D is 4.57;6.92. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the equivalence point and another point. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait another point: could the 25% titration be 25% of the initial solution's moles? Let me think.

Wait, when titrating, the 25% would be 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³, which is correct. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol, as I did.

Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculations are correct, and the answer is option A. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D)4.57;6.92

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the equivalence point calculation. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, maybe I got the Kb wrong. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.74.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.4054e-10.

Yes, correct.

So the Kb is correct, and the calculations for x are correct, giving OH- concentration of 3.288e-6 → pOH 5.48 → pH 8.52.

So option A is the correct answer. So why is option D present? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point concentration.

Wait, 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid gives 0.001 mol. So when you add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol, it neutralizes all the acid. So 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³.

Concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

But wait, maybe the solution isn't just acetate and water. Sodium ions are spectator ions, so that's fine.

Wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated with strong base is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

The formula for pH is (pKa + pKb)/2, but I think that's an approximation. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct.

Wait, for a salt of a weak acid and strong base (like CH3COONa), the pH is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base.

So, as I did earlier, using Kb = 5.405e-10, and concentration 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me recalculate the Kb approach without the approximation.

Set up the equation:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be [OH^-].

Then, [CH3COOH] = x, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x = 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈5.48 → pH =8.52.

That's correct.

So why is option D an option? Let me see what if the initial dilution was miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I did the initial dilution incorrectly. Let me think again.

Initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³.

So concentration = (0.05 M *20 cm³) /40 cm³ = (1 mmol) /40 cm³ → 0.025 M. Correct.

So I think I didn't make a mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to factor in the dilution at 25% titration. Wait, the volume at 25% titration is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³.

So the concentrations would be:

moles of acetic acid: 0.00075 mol → 0.00075 /0.0425 L ≈0.017647 M.

moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol → 0.00025 /0.0425 L ≈0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈0.3333.

Which is the same as before, so pH is 4.26. So no, the volume doesn't affect the ratio, so the pH is the same.

So the conclusion is option A is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again: option A is 4.26;8.52. So why is this not one of the standard options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, if 25% of the NaOH is added, which is 2.5 cm³, and the initial solution is 40 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 -0.00025=0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^-:0.00025.

So the ratio is 0.00025/0.00075=1/3.

pH = pKa + log(1/3) =4.74 + (-0.477)=4.263.

Yes.

So that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \implies M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction with NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required for equivalence are also 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{\text{concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 mol of sodium acetate in a total volume of 50 cm³ (40 cm³ + 10 cm³). The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \(K_a\) by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the ICE table and assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x^2 = 0.02 \times 5.405 \times 10^{-10} = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

Here, \(x = [\text{OH}^-]\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48 \implies \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, so 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with an equal amount of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]
\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is now 42.5 cm³. The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.74 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) = 4.74 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** 4.26; 8.52  
- **B)** 3.17; 6.73  
- **C)** 4.73; 7.00  
- **D)** 4.57; 6.92  

The correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
