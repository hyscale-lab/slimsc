Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, it can influence their overall brightness and temperature. But how does that affect the ionization states or the energy levels of atoms in the photosphere?

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but why does having spots make the effective temperature lower? Oh right, dark spots are cooler regions on the star, so when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall emission decreases, hence lower Teff.

Now, the main part: the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to the Boltzmann factor: (g1/g2) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k T)).

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that tells me something about the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So I can calculate the energy difference ΔE between level 2 and level 1.

Wait, but how does the effective temperature of the star affect this ratio? Because when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops. Wait, but wait: the spots themselves are cooler, so perhaps the regions without spots are hotter. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So does the whole photosphere cool, or just parts of it? Hmm, the question states that the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So perhaps the
