Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's going on.

The question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, right? The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, and express it in Joules, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I'll have to choose between A to D.

Hmm. So I'm thinking about what kind of energy this system has. Since all the particles are charged, the system's potential energy is due to their electrostatic interactions. So I should calculate the electrostatic potential energy between them.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so we're probably just looking at the potential energy between the charges. Since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, I think each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the question is about the potential energy between these charges.

But wait, I should clarify: are the 12 charges all at 2m from P, but are they fixed in some configuration? Or are they arranged in a way that maybe they form a regular structure, like a sphere or something? Because the problem doesn't specify, but for the potential energy, the arrangement might matter. But since the question is about the minimum energy, maybe it's considering the charges arranged in such a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, wait, but no. Because the problem says that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of them is at a fixed radius of 2m from P. So they can't move closer or farther than that from P. But how are they arranged around P? Are they all at the same point? No, that's impossible because then the potential energy would be very high. So probably, they're on a sphere of radius 2m around P, each at a point on the sphere.

Wait, but for the purpose of calculating the potential energy of the system, maybe I can think of each charge as being at 2m from the fixed charge at P. So the potential energy due to the fixed charge at P and each of the 12
