Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pericyclic reactions, especially sigmatropic rearrangements. But I'll take it step by step.

First, the question mentions that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a terminal pi bond into a sigma bond. It also says that Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and these are usually thermodynamically favored. So the reactions provided here must be some kind of sigmatropic rearrangements, probably Cope or Claisen, or maybe something else like a retro-ene reaction.

There are three reactions to complete, and I need to find which option (A, B, C, D) correctly assigns products A, B, and C.

Let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Hmm, the starting materials are an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon, and an allylic alcohol (but-3-en-2-ol). In acidic conditions and heat, what kind of reaction happens here? I remember that when you have a dienol ether (like Claisen rearrangement) or similar, under certain conditions, it can undergo a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. But wait, the starting material here is an amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of an oxaziridine or something else.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is actually morpholine derivative? Or maybe it's more like a substituted amine. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH2OCH3)2NH. So the structure is OCH3 attached to the same carbon as NH2 and another OCH3?

Wait, wait, structure is more accurately:

The molecule is CH2(OCH2CH3)2NH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 on the first carbon (the nitrogen is on the first carbon
