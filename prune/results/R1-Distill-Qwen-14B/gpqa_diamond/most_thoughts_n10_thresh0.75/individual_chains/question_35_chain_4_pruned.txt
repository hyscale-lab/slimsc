Hmm, okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator, specifically the Y-component, Ay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, actually, c is h/(4π)? Or is it h bar? Because I remember that in angular momentum, sometimes we use ħ, which is h/(2π). Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Oh, wait the problem states c = h/(4π), so that's different. So c is h/(4π), which is half of ħ because ħ is h/(2π). So c is ħ/2, right? Because h/(4π) is the same as (h/(2π))/2 = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

Then S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i), the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

I've seen matrices like this before. Oh right, this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. The Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, that's exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So S = σy.

Now, the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S. So Ay = c * σy.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix like σy are ±1. So when you multiply by a constant c, the eigenvalues become ±c. So the eigenvalues a of the operator Ay should be ±c. Since c is h/(4π), then a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The eigenvalues of σy are 1 and -1. So when you have an operator like c σy, the eigenvalues are c*(1) and c*(-1), which would be c and -c. So for Ay, the eigenvalues are ±c = ±(h/(4π)).
