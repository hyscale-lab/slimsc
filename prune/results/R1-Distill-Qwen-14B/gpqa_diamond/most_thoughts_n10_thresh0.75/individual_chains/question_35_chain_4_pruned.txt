Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), which I think is similar to the reduced Planck's constant, since ħ is h/(2π). Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so c here is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. Oh right, because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. That's useful to note.

The matrix S is given as:
First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0

So S looks like:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar. Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. Oh wait, so S here is the Pauli Y matrix. So S = σ_y, which is the Pauli Y matrix.

So then Ay is c times σ_y. Since c is ħ/2, then Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components are usually Sx, Sy, Sz, each equal to ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So yeah, that makes sense. So Ay should be (ħ/2) σ_y.

So the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is about which statement is correct regarding this calculation.

The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let's find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay is (ħ/2)*σ_y, which would be (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the matrix Ay is:

[ 0          -(i ħ/2) ]
[ i ħ/2       0       ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0   -i ħ/2
Row 2: i ħ/2 0

The characteristic equation is the determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So the determinant is | (-a)(-a) - (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) | = 0.

Wait, the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a   -(i ħ/2) ]
[ i ħ/2   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( -(i ħ/2) * (i ħ/2) )

So that's a² - [ (-i)(i) * (ħ²/4) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the product ( -i ħ/2 )( i ħ/2 )= (-i)(i) * (ħ²/4) )

-i * i is -i², which is -(-1) = +1. So the product is (1) * (ħ²/4) = ħ²/4.

Wait, but in the determinant calculation, it's the product of the off-diagonal elements multiplied by (-1) because it's (top right * bottom left) which are the products. Wait no, the determinant is (top left * bottom right) - (top right * bottom left).

So top left is (-a), bottom right is (-a), so their product is a².

Top right is (-i ħ/2), bottom left is (i ħ/2). So their product is (-i)(i) (ħ²/4) ) = (-i²) (ħ²/4) ) = (1) (ħ²/4).

So determinant equation is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So a² = ħ²/4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait
