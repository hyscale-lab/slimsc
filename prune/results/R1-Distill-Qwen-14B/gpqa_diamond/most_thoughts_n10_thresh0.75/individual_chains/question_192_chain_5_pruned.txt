Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The cavity isn't at the center because the center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r < R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside, so it's beyond the conductor's radius R. The distance from the center of the conductor to P is L. The distance from the center of the cavity to P is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

I remember that when a conductor is uncharged and has a cavity, the charges inside the cavity induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, right? So when the +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor itself is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q as well, but wait, no, the conductor was initially uncharged. Wait, no, the conductor's net charge is zero because it was uncharged. So when you place a charge +q inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface. But that would leave the conductor with a net charge of -q, but wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral. Oh wait, no: the conductor's total charge is zero. So placing a charge inside the cavity will cause the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. Or wait, no, wait. If the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q, then the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner surface's -q. But wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero. So, the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q in order for the total conductor's charge to be zero. Wait, no, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral overall, so the sum of the
