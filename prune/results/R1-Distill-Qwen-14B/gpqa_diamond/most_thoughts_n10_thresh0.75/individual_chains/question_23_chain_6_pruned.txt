Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. The researcher used TLC and saw that the reactant spot decreased, with two new spots appearing. I need to figure out which products are formed from the given options.

Wait, the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring with an ether group (-O-) attached. The other part of the ether is a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me break that down: the butenyl has four carbons, with a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's but-3-en). So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The substituents are two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? Wait, wait, no. Wait, but-3-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no, the numbering. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, no, wait. Wait, butenyl can be 1,2,3, or 4 positions for the double bond. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be, because that would be CH2CH2CH=CH2, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, perhaps it's CH2-
