Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and II, followed by some HPLC analysis. The goal is to find out how many peaks the chemist observes in the chromatograms. The options are given, so I need to figure out each step accurately.

First, let's look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So, when LAH is used, it should reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait, hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-... Let me draw it out mentally. The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3, but wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, no. Wait, hexan-3-one has six carbons with the ketone on the third carbon. So it's CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, maybe I should number it correctly. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: C=O, then carbons 4,5,6. Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Let me write it as CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Right, so when you reduce that with LAH, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CHOH group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So that structure is, I think, on carbon 5, there's
