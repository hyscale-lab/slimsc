Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry of a product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, I'll try to figure out what the compounds A, B, C, D, etc., are based on the reactions given. Let's go through each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when a solid metal reacts with a diatomic halogen gas, it forms a salt. The bright red color makes me think of something like sulfur, but wait, maybe it's more about transition metals. Oh! Iron and sulfur reactions come to mind. Iron(III) oxide maybe? Or wait, another thought: maybe it's about a metal reacting with chlorine gas. Wait, but 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, 8 equivalents. Let me think: in a reaction, the number of equivalents is the mole ratio. So if A reacts with 8 moles of B, the stoichiometry would be A + 8B → C. So for example, if B is Cl2, then A could be a metal, and C would be a metal chloride. But what's bright red? Hmm.

Another possibility is that C is a compound of antimony or arsenic. Wait, maybe it's more about something else. Oh, wait, maybe C is SbCl5 or something? Or perhaps it's something else. Alternatively, maybe solid A is sodium (Na), and gas B is chlorine (Cl2). But sodium plus excess chlorine would form NaCl. But wait, for sodium, the reaction is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So if A is Na, but with 8 equivalents of B, that would be 8 Cl2. That doesn't fit the stoichiometry. Maybe A is Fe and B is Cl2? FeCl3 is a possible product, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's about another reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B, the product C is a compound with a certain structure. Let me think about metals that when reacting with a diatomic gas in a 1:8 ratio would form a bright red substance. Wait, maybe it's about sulfur. Sulfur is bright yellow, but maybe in another form, perhaps as Sb (antimony) compounds. Hmm... Alternatively, maybe it's about iron(III) oxide, but that's usually reddish brown, not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's about vanadium compounds. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not bright red.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the product C is SF6, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's about something like FeS, but that's black. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's about a metal reacting with oxygen. Wait, but if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 O2. So A + 8 O2 → C.

Wait, what metal reacts with O2 in such a way? For example, aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. The reaction is 4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2, not 8. So perhaps another metal.

Wait, maybe it's about lead? Lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is dark brown. Not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product C is a metal carbide? Probably not since that's usually black or dark.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G.

Hmm. So C is reacting with water to produce
