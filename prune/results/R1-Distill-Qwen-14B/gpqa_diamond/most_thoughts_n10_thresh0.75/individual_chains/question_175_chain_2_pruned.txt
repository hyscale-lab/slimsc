Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it produces. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a certain angle and the form of the function f, which depends on lambda and theta.

Alright, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and what form f takes.

Wait, I think this relates to the radiation pattern of an oscillating dipole. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a specific dependence on the angle. The power radiated per unit solid angle (like the intensity) for a dipole varies with the square of the cosine of theta. Because the maximum is when theta is 0, so the radiation is strongest along the axis.

Wait, no, wait. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). So the maximum is when cos(theta) is ±1, meaning theta=0 or 180 degrees. Wait no, wait, no. Wait, 1 + cos^2(theta) has its maximum at cos(theta)=1 or -1, which is theta=0 or 180. But wait, when theta is
