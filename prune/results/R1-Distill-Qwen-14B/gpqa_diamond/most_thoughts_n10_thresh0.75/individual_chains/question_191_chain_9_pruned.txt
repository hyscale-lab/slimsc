Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then, it's treated in a series of reactions, and I need to find out what the final product, product 4, looks like. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let me break down each step.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate something. In the presence of benzyl bromide, maybe it's an alkylation. So perhaps they're doing an SN2 reaction or maybe it's adding a benzyl group.

Wait, the starting material has a ketone group (cyclohexan-1-one). Sodium hydride is a base, so maybe deprotonates the alpha position. The starting molecule also has a hydroxymethyl group at C3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at C5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an isopropenyl group, right? So that's a CH2-C(CH2) group attached.

So, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl) and 5-(isopropenyl) on cyclohexanone.

Step 1: Sodium hydride is used, so probably deprotonates an acidic proton. Where's the acidic proton here? The alpha protons to the ketone (cyclohexanone) are more acidic. So deprotonating at C2 or C4, maybe.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-hydroxymethyl and 5-isopropenyl. So the cyclohexanone is at C1, right? So the carbons adjacent would be C2 and C6. Hmm, maybe the hydroxymethyl is at C3, which is adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1. So C2 and C6 are the alpha positions. The starting molecule has a hydroxymethyl at C3, which is gamma to the ketone. So maybe the alpha protons are on
