Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Michael addition problem. Let me start by recalling what the Michael reaction is about. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually an enolate, attacks the beta position, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at the question, there are three separate reactions given, each labeled A, B, and C. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When deprotonated, it becomes a strong nucleophile, the enolate ion.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-CO2Me, but with the p-tolyl group. Wait, I think the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO2Me? No, wait. Wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- something. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3 position. Or wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO2Me? Or is it CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the 3-position is the end of the chain, so maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So for acrylate, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So substituting at the 3-position would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=C-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. No, that doesn't fit the E stereochemistry. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, but wait, acrylate has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the 3-position would be
