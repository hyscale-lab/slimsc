Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says it's a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max. The options are all different expressions involving c, the speed of light, which suggests that relativistic effects are important here.

Wait, in a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed can be found using conservation of energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², which is converted into kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So solving for v_max gives v = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). But that's the non-relativistic case. Since this problem includes c, it's probably considering relativistic effects, so the regular approach might not work.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic, it's the total energy. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, energy conservation still holds, but the expressions change because of relativity.

Wait, the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator would be different. Oh right, in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as before, but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy at x=0 (maximum speed) is the sum of potential energy (zero?) and kinetic energy.

Wait, no, the maximum displacement is A, so the potential energy is maximum there, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, but the kinetic energy is maximum. So energy conservation in this case says that the total energy (which is the same everywhere) equals the maximum kinetic energy plus the maximum potential energy.

Wait, no, the total energy is the same whether the oscillator is at maximum displacement or velocity. So at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, that's only when we
