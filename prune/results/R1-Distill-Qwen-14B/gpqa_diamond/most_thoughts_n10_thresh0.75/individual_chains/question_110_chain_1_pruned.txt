Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, but wait, wait—wait, sometimes it's about apparent magnitude. Because apparent magnitude is how bright the star appears from Earth. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V magnitude brighter than 17, which means apparent V mag less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter. Wait, no, wait again. If it's "brighter than 17 mag", that probably means the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because in astronomy, the lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the object. Right, so if a star is brighter than 17 mag, its apparent V magnitude is ≤17. So ESPRESSO can detect up to 17 mag.

Then HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V mag ≤16. So HIRES can only see stars that are brighter (apparent magnitude ≤16), which is more restrictive than ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So a star must be brighter than both 16 and 17 to be detected by both. Wait, no, because to be
