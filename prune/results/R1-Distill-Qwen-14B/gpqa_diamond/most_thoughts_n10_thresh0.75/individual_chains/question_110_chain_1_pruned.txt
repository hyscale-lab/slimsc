Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. 

Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different capabilities. From what I vaguely recall, the brightness of the star in a certain magnitude range determines whether it can be observed by a particular instrument. Oh right, the problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait: I should check that again. Oh yes, it says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 V mag can be observed. Wait, but wait—wait, if a star is brighter, its magnitude is smaller. So a star with V magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO observes stars with V_mag ≤ 17? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, no. Wait, brightness is inversely related to magnitude. So a brighter star has a lower (smaller) magnitude number. So a star that's brighter than 17 mag would have a magnitude less than 17, right? So ESPRESSO can observe stars where V_mag ≤ 17. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V_mag ≤ 16. Because stars with V_mag up to 16 can be observed by HIRES.

Wait, no. Wait the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Wait, that's the exact wording. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, then it's V_mag <17. Because a star that's brighter has a lower magnitude. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V_mag less than 17. But wait, no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has apparent V magnitude less than 17, it's brighter than a magnitude of 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V
