Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Right, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, the state is a linear combination of these basis states.

First, I think I should normalize the state |alpha>. Because when a state is given, it's usually normalized to 1, but here it's just proportional, so I need to find the normalization factor.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the normalization, I calculate the inner product of the state with itself. So, the inner product <alpha|alpha> should equal 1 after normalization.

Let me compute the coefficients. The coefficients are a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of |a|² + |b|².

Calculating |a|²: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 + 1 = 2. And |b|²: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 +1=5. So adding them gives 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Wait, wait. The problem says "proportional to" that combination, so the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but to get it as a normalized state, we divide by sqrt(7). So, the actual state is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next part: the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and A_ij =0 otherwise. Wait, that matrix... Let me think. The operator is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin up and down. So, the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because if i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2. So for i=1, j=2, and i=2, j=1, the elements are hbar/2. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So this is an off-diagonal matrix with hbar/2 on both off-diagonal elements.

Wait, that's the sigma_x operator multiplied by hbar/2, right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and multiplying each element by hbar/2 gives the A matrix here. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. Because the operator is Hermitian (since A_ij = A_ji* and the matrix is real and symmetric), it will have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

The eigenstates of
