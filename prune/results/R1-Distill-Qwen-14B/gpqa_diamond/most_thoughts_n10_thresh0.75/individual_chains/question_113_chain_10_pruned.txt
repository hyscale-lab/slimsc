Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is based on the given spectra.

First, let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The major peaks are at 3000 cm-1 (a very broad peak), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. I remember that FTIR can tell us a lot about functional groups. The broad peak around 3000 is probably from O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait: a very broad peak might be more indicative of an -OH group in a carboxylic acid because they tend to have broader and stronger peaks than alcohols. Or maybe it's a strong hydrogen-bonded O-H, like in a phenol? Hmm, not sure yet.

The peak at 1700 cm-1 usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm-1 peak is a bit lower, maybe indicating a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Like, maybe an aromatic ketone or something like that. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an ester or amide? Wait, but amides would have N-H peaks too, which might not be the case here.

Wait, the 1700 and 1650 might also suggest maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. For example, if it's a carbonyl group conjugated with an aromatic ring, the carbonyl's stretching might be around 1650 instead of 1700. So perhaps it's a ketone attached to benzene? Or maybe an ester or something else.

Looking next at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the molecule has at least one double bond, probably in a vinyl group. Or maybe it's conjugated. So I'm thinking maybe a benzene ring with some substituents, considering vinyl regions.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm. A fragment at 45 could correspond to several things. Let me think. 45 is the mass of something like C3H7O or maybe (CH3)2O or something else. Wait, wait: 45 could be (CH2O) which is formaldehyde, but that's probably not. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH3CO group (acetyl), which is 43. Wait, 43 is CH3CO (43 = 12*2 + 1*4 +1
