Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6 because a regular lithium atom has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its kinetic energy, but I'm not exactly sure if it's relativistic. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light, relativistic effects are definitely important here. So I can't use the classical kinetic energy formula; I need to use the relativistic one.

The formula for relativistic kinetic energy is K = (γ - 1) * m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Right, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I need to calculate γ for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute γ. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So γ is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh yeah, 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yeah, γ is 1/0.28. Let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 0.28 is 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

So γ is about 3.5714. Now, I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The problem probably gives me the mass, but since it's not stated, I must recall. Oh right, the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass, but perhaps the question assumes that the mass is known. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to know the atomic mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is the same as that of 6 nucleons. Oh wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². But Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons in total. So the rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. But wait, that's for free nucleons. The actual mass of the nucleus might
