Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of the collider when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the energy of RHIC such that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often considered, but sometimes total energy is used. I'm a bit confused about whether to use kinetic energy or total energy here.

Wait, the problem says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I think it's referring to the total energy of the nucleus. Because in relativity, energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (mcÂ²). But wait, the question might be asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Let me read the question again.

No, the question says "energy of the RHIC" which I think refers to the total energy imparted to the nucleus. Because when physicists
