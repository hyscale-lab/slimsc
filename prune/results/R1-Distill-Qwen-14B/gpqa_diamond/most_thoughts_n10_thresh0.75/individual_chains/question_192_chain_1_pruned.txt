Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor since L > R, right? And the conductor was initially uncharged. But when we put a charge inside the cavity, that's going to induce some charges on the conductor's inner and outer surfaces, I think.

I remember something about conductors and charges. When a charge is placed inside a conductor, the conductor's electrons will redistribute. But wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. Oh wait, when you place a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. And the outer surface will have no charge because the conductor itself was initially neutral. Or wait, no: the outer surface would have a charge equal to the inner induced charge's opposite, but wait, the conductor being neutral, the total induced charges must sum to zero.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have a conductor and place a charge inside its cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, because the charge +q inside the cavity attracts the electrons in the conductor. Those electrons move to the inner surface, leaving a +q charge on the outer surface to maintain neutrality. Wait, noâ€”if the conductor was initially uncharged, the total charge must remain zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero.

Wait, the inner surface: the charge inside the cavity is +q. The conductor's material is a conductor,
