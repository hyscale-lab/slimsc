Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead to the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Wait, actually, waitâ€”no. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene. Let me think. The main chain is ethan-1-one, which is a ketone. So it's attached to the benzene ring via a ketone group. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3) attached at position 1, and at position 3 there's a bromine, and at position 5, a nitro group.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents on the benzene would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. Because the ketone is at position 1. So the benzene ring has the ketone (COCH3) at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2, respectively. So the substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me think again. The numbering of the benzene ring is such that the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group. So, if the ketone is in position 1, then substituents are at positions 3 (meta) and 5 (which is actually meta as well from position 1, because position 5 is two carbons away in a different direction). Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. Let's say the ketone is at position 1. Then the substituents are at 3 and 5, which are both meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to each other. But regardless, the main point is that the benzene ring has a ketone
