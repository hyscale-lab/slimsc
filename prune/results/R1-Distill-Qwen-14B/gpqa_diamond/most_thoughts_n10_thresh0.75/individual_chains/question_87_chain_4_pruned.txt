Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR problem. Let me read the question carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbons. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, I need to figure out which NMR spectrum matches this structure.

First, let's break down the structure. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, no, because if it's di-substituted, each substituent could have their own carbons.

Wait, the ring is 6-membered, so 6 carbons from the benzene. The substituents should account for the remaining 2. But wait, wait, total carbons in the compound are 8, so substituents add 2 carbons. Hmm. So the substituents are probably something like an acetyl group and a halogen? Because carbonyl suggests a ketone or maybe an ester, but halogen is attached directly to the ring.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR shows a carbonyl (so C=O), and an aromatic-halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but how can a di-substituted benzene have two substituents, each with a carbonyl and a halogen? Or maybe one substituent has both? Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents that have carbonyl and halogen. Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene ring, so each substituent is a group attached to the ring.

Wait, the substituents could be two different groups: one being a carbonyl-containing group and another being a halogen. But wait, halogen on the ring is just a single atom, right? So a halogen substituent would contribute one atom but no carbons. So if the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a substituent like –CO–R) and a halogen, that could add
