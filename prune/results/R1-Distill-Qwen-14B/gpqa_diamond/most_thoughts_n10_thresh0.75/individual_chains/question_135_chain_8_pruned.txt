Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). 

Wait, so the interaction term is involving fermions, right? The boson X is interacting with fermions. The Lagrangian looks like it's a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction because it's similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions. The Yukawa term is usually something like y ψ̄ ψ X, where y is the coupling constant, and X is the Higgs field or in this case, the boson. 

So the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I remember that for a boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the fermion mass must be less than half the boson mass. Because each fermion gets some energy, right? So the condition is 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. 

Let me list all the possible fermions. The charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus, and their antiparticles. Then there are the quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quarks are really heavy, like 173 GeV, so they won't be considered here. Same with the tau, which is about 1.78 GeV. Wait, no, wait: tau is about 1.78 GeV? Or is that the muon? No, muon is about 0.1 GeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. 

So for each fermion, I need to check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:

Up (u): ~0.003 GeV (but I think this varies, but for the sake of this problem, let's take them as their current known masses)
Down (d): ~0.004-0.005 GeV
Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
Top (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV, so no for X.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f must be ≤6 GeV. So m_f ≤3 GeV.

So let's calculate 2m for each:

Electron: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV <<6 → yes
Muon: 0.21 GeV → yes
Tau: 3.554 GeV → 3.554 >3? So 3.554
