Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions. Let me see what I know.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2=9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So, 2*8 =16 +2=18. Minus H which is 9: 18-9=9. Then X is zero, so +N which is 1: 9+1=10. Divide by 2: 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each could be a ring or a double bond. So maybe a benzene ring (which is three double bonds, so three degrees) and then some other rings or double bonds. Or maybe a benzene ring plus a double bond and a ring? Hmm.

The NMR data is given, so that's a clue. The 1H-NMR shows: 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes other deshielded protons could be there too, like a ketone maybe? No, more likely an aldehyde here.

Then, 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's a typical aromatic region, maybe para-substituted. Then 6.51 ppm as another doublet (d, 2H) which also suggests aromatic protons, perhaps in a para arrangement. So maybe there's a benzene ring with substituents that give these doublets. Then 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group, but two protons? Or possibly vinylic protons that are deshielded but not split much. Finally, 3.66 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H), probably some CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. Maybe an OCH2 group.

Putting this together: The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm suggests a carbonyl group. So the molecule might have a benzene ring attached to an aldehyde and some substituents.

Let me think about the substituents on the benzene. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each have two protons. If it's a para-substituted benzene, the adjacent protons would be doublets. Wait, but looking at typical NMR shifts, a para-substituted ring would have two protons each as doublets, which matches the data. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents, like two phenyl groups or other groups.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the structure. The benzene part would be C6H5. But the compound is C8H9NO, so the remaining part is 2 carbons, a nitrogen, and some oxygens. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus 2 more carbons, maybe. So perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72. So maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has a CH2O group or something. Let's see.

Alternatively, could the structure be a diphenyl compound? Because the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, the aromatic
