Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value of an observable. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space. Oh right, and those vectors should be normalized, meaning their inner product with themselves should be 1. Let me check that first because I might need to normalize it for calculations.

So the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is probably this vector divided by sqrt(6). But wait, does the problem mention normalization? Oh, no, the given state is just a vector, but in quantum mechanics, states are normalized. So I think I should normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector |ψ> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. I'll keep that in mind.

The observable is given by the matrix P. P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me note down its elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

I think P is a Hermitian matrix because observables are Hermitian. Let me check if P is equal to its conjugate transpose. All the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose would just be the transpose. Let me transpose P:

Column 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Column 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Column 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, that's the same as the original matrix. So yes, P is Hermitian. Good, because that means the eigenvalues are real, which are the possible measurement outcomes.

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the corresponding eigenvector. Then, the probability would be the square of the amplitude of that eigenvector in the state |ψ>.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute P|ψ> and see if that gives me an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P first. Let me try that.

So finding the eigenvalues
