Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question is: A supernova's ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, okay, so this sounds like a problem involving relative velocity and perhaps time dilation due to special relativity. Because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that). So relativistic effects might come into play.

Let me think. So from the ejecta's frame (let's call this frame S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in S', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. 

But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S) during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So we're moving from the ejecta's frame to the Galaxy's frame. 

Wait, but if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at some velocity, and we need to find the distance it covers in 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. Or wait, no: wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But the Galaxy's frame would perceive that time differently due to time dilation.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The problem says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame." So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds elapse, and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So the time difference between the frames has to be considered.

So this is a problem involving relative velocity and Lorentz transformations, perhaps. Because we have two inertial frames moving relative to each other.

First, let's establish the velocity between the two frames. Let’s say in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at velocity v as well, but wait, no. Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So if the ejecta is moving at velocity v in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -v (opposite direction), but due to relativistic velocity addition. Oh wait, but the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So in S', the Galaxy's velocity is 60,000 km/s. So in S, the Galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s (since in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so the ejecta must be moving at -60,000 km/s in S).

Wait, maybe I should approach this more carefully. Let me define the frames. Let’s say in the Galaxy frame S, the ejecta is moving with velocity u. Then in the ejecta's frame S', the velocity of the Galaxy is given as 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So what is u in terms of this?

In special relativity, the velocity of an object as seen in two frames moving at velocity v relative to each other is given by the velocity addition formula. So if in S, the ejecta has velocity u, then in S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to S), the velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, the direction is important here. Let me define the direction: let’s say in S, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (so negative direction?), but I need to set up a coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that the velocity observed in S' is 60,000 km/s. Since S' is the ejecta's frame, which is moving at velocity u relative to S. So in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity u, and in S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity –u' (because the frames are moving at u relative to each other). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

In the rest frame of the Galaxy (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v_e (let's say v_e is towards the center, so positive). Then, in the rest frame of the ejecta (S'), the Galaxy is moving at velocity v_g. According to the problem, v_g is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, so v_g = -v_e (since in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is stationary in S'). So that suggests that v_e is equal to 60,000 km/s? Wait, no. Wait, no, maybe not. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Let me think: if the ejecta is moving at v in S, then in S' (which is moving at v relative to S), an observer in S' would see the Galaxy moving at a different velocity.

Alternatively, because S' is the ejecta's rest frame, and S is the Galaxy's rest frame, the relative velocity between S and S' is v, which is the speed of the ejecta in S. So from the problem statement, in S' (ejecta's frame), the velocity of the Galaxy (which is S) is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So what is the velocity of the Galaxy in S'? 

Wait, in S, the Galaxy is stationary. So in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S (since in S, the ejecta is moving at v), the velocity of the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) is equal to -v (the opposite of the velocity of S' relative to S, because if S' is moving at v relative to S, then S sees S' moving at v, and S' sees S moving at -v, but due to relativistic effects, it's not just -v, but perhaps a different value. Oh right, because of the velocity transformation formula.

Wait, the correct velocity addition formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of an object in S, and u' is its velocity in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

In this case, in S, the Galaxy is stationary, so u = 0. So the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = (0 - v)/(1 - 0) = -v. But wait, that's only in the case where the relative velocity v is much smaller than c, so non-relativistic. But wait, according to the problem, in S', the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta. So according to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s. So substituting into the equation:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

But in S, the Galaxy is at rest, so u = 0. So u' = (-v) / (1 - 0) ) => u' = -v. So that would imply that the velocity in S' is -v. But according to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s. So that would suggest that v is -60,000 km/s. Wait, but this can't be right because v is the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should reorient the coordinate system. Let's say the positive x-direction is towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving in the positive x direction at velocity v. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v. Then in S', the velocity of the Galaxy is u' = (0 - v)/(1 + (v * 0)/c²) )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

In this case, u is the velocity of the Galaxy in S, which is 0 (since in S, the Galaxy is at rest). So u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c² ) = -v / 1 = -v. But according to the problem, in S', the Galaxy is approaching the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So that would mean u' = -60,000 km/s. Wait, but u' is the velocity of the Galaxy in S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S. So if u' is -60,000 km/s, then v must be 60,000 km/s. Because u' = -v, so v=60,000 km/s.

Wait, but if v is 60,000 km/s, that's 0.2c. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the ejecta's speed is v=60,000 km/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is 60,000 km/s. So, u' = 60,000 km/s in the direction towards the ejecta, which is the same as the direction of motion in S. 

So according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity of the Galaxy in S' is u' = (0 - v)/(1 - (0 * v)/c² ) = -v. So if u' is +60,000 km/s, then -v = 60,000 km/s, so v = -60,000 km/s. But that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s, i.e., towards the center. So v = 60,000 km/s, but is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the direction. Let me clarify: Let's say the positive direction is from the ejecta towards the Galaxy. So in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy (so v is positive). So in S, the velocity is +v. Then in S', the velocity of the Galaxy would be u' = (0 - v)/(1 - (0 * v)/c² ) = -v. So u' is negative, meaning in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at speed v. So if in S', the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s, then u' is 60,000 km/s in the negative direction (since u' is -v). Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's be precise.

Let me think again: In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So ejecta's velocity in S is v = +60,000 km/s (assuming positive is towards the center). Then, in S', which is the ejecta's frame, what is the velocity of the Galaxy? Using the velocity addition formula, u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in S (the Galaxy is at rest in S, so u=0). So u' = (0 - v)/(1 - 0) ) = -v. So in S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity -v, which is -60,000 km/s. But the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that would mean that u' is 60,000 km/s in the direction towards the ejecta, which is the same as what we have, because u' is -v. So if u' is 60,000 km/s, then v must be -60,000 km/s. But the direction matters here.

Wait, maybe I have the directions inverted. Let's say the positive direction is from the Galaxy towards the ejecta. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v, which would be negative. So v = -60,000 km/s. Then, in S', the velocity of the Galaxy would be (0 - (-60,000)) / (1 - 0) ) = 60,000 km/s. Which matches the problem statement. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s, meaning moving towards the Galaxy (since positive is away from the ejecta).

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try to set up the problem more clearly.

Let me define the positive direction as the direction from the Galaxy towards the ejecta. So, in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving towards the center (Galaxy) at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = -60,000 km/s (since it's moving in the negative direction, towards the Galaxy). Or wait: if positive is away from the galaxy, then the ejecta is moving in the negative direction. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just assign the velocities correctly without getting stuck on the sign, but perhaps I need to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of magnitude. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So its velocity is v = 60,000 km/s towards the center, which is the same direction as the Galaxy's movement in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, no, because in S', the Galaxy is approaching the ejecta, which is at rest in S'.

Wait, perhaps to avoid confusion, let's model it as follows:

- In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (so v is positive if it's moving in the direction towards the center, which would be negative if our coordinate system has positive going outward from the Galaxy). Hmm, maybe I should just take v as 60,000 km/s in the direction towards the Galaxy.

So in S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Then, in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So according to the velocity addition formula, what is the velocity of the Galaxy in S'?

Wait, but according to the formula, the velocity u' (Galaxy's velocity in S') is (0 - v)/(1 - (0 * v)/c²) = -v. So if in S, the ejecta is moving at v, then in S', the Galaxy is moving at -v. So if v is 60,000 km/s, then in S', the Galaxy is moving at -60,000 km/s. But that would mean the Galaxy is moving away from the ejecta. But the problem states that in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So that would imply that u' = 60,000 km/s, which would require that -v = 60,000 km/s, so v = -60,000 km/s.

Wait, that can't be right because v is the ejecta's velocity in S. So perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Maybe in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v = 60,000 km/s, so in S', the Galaxy is moving at velocity u' = (0 - v)/(1) ) = -v. So if in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (which is stationary in S'), then u' must be positive if the direction is towards the ejecta. So if u' = +60,000 km/s, then -v = 60,000, so v = -60,000 km/s. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is -60,000 km/s, meaning it's moving in the opposite direction, which is towards the Galaxy if the positive direction is away from the Galaxy.

Wait, this is getting really tricky. Let me try to approach it another way. Suppose that the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is v. Then, the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame is u' given by the formula. According to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, so the velocity is positive in that direction.

We can set up the equation u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

But in this case, the Galaxy is at rest in S, so u = 0. So u' = (0 - v) / (1 - 0) ) = -v. 

According to the problem, u' is +60,000 km/s. So -v = 60,000 km/s → v = -60,000 km/s. 

So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at v = -60,000 km/s. The negative sign indicates direction. So if the positive direction is, say, towards the Galaxy, then the ejecta is moving in the negative direction, which would be away from the Galaxy. But that contradicts the problem statement, which says the ejecta is moving towards the center. So perhaps I have the direction backward.

Wait, perhaps I should define the positive direction as the direction the ejecta is moving. So in S, the ejecta is moving in the positive direction at v = 60,000 km/s. Then, in S', the Galaxy's velocity would be u' = (0 - v)/(1 - (0 * v)/c² ) ) = -v → u' = -60,000 km/s. But the problem says that in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s, so that would imply u' = +60,000 km/s. So this can't be correct either. So perhaps my initial assumption about the direction is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the positive direction is from the ejecta towards the Galaxy. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (positive direction) at v = +60,000 km/s. Then, in S', the velocity of the Galaxy is u' = (0 - v)/(1 - 0) )= -v = -60,000 km/s. But the problem says that in S', the Galaxy is approaching the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So u' should be positive 60,000 km/s. So this suggests that -v = 60,000 km/s → v = -60,000 km/s. But v is the ejecta's velocity in S, so that would imply the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in the negative direction. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the signs here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, but I don't think so because the speed is 60,000 km/s which is 0.2c. But perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about it differently. The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is coming towards it at high speed. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s.

But if that's the case, then the problem is straightforward. The ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. But the time given is in the ejecta's frame, so 50 seconds. So we need to find how much the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, but wait. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance would be v * t. But what is the time in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, because time intervals can differ between frames due to time dilation. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) and the time in the ejecta's frame (t') are related by t = gamma * t' if the events happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame. But wait, in this case, the ejecta is moving, so the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are not at the same place in either frame. So perhaps I'm getting into a more complicated situation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the Lorentz transformations. Let me consider two events: the start and the end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta's frame.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events (t' = 0, x' = 0) and (t' = 50 s, x' = 0) happen at the same place. So in S', the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is approaching.

But to find the corresponding times and positions in S (Galaxy's frame), we can use the Lorentz transformation equations:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )
x = gamma (x' + v t' )

In S', x' = 0 for both events. So the first event (t'=0, x'=0) transforms to t=0, x=0 in S. The second event (t'=50 s, x'=0) transforms to:

t = gamma * (50 + (v * 0)/c² ) = gamma * 50 s
x = gamma * (0 + v * 50 ) = gamma * v * 50

Wait, but what is v here? Because in the transformation from S' to S, S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Wait, in the standard setup, S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis. So in our case, if the ejecta is moving at v in the Galaxy's frame, then S' (ejecta's frame) is moving at velocity v relative to S (Galaxy's frame). So the velocity v is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, but earlier I was getting confused about the direction, but perhaps for the time being, I can take v as positive 60,000 km/s towards the center, so v = +60,000 km/s.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that in S', the velocity of the Galaxy is u' = -v. So if in S', the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then u' = 60,000 km/s, which would imply v = -60,000 km/s in the standard setup. But perhaps I shouldn't get too bogged down by that now and proceed with the calculations.

So, using the Lorentz transformations, in the second event, x'=0, t'=50 s. So in S, the time is t = gamma * (50) and the position is x = gamma * (60,000 km/s * 50 s).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, v is the velocity of the frame S' relative to S. So if S' is moving at v relative to S, then the velocity is v. But in our case, in S, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in S, the ejecta's velocity is v. So S' is moving at velocity v relative to S.

So for the second event, t = gamma * (50) and x = gamma * (v * 50).

Wait, but in S, the ejecta is moving at v, so in 50 seconds of S' time, the ejecta's position in S would be x = gamma * v * t'.

Wait, but no, because in S, the time is longer due to time dilation. So we need to compute the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during its own 50 seconds.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v, so in t seconds, the distance is v * t.

But the time t here is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame. But the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, so we need to relate these two.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than in the ejecta's frame because of time dilation. So t = gamma * t', where t' is 50 seconds.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end of 50 seconds) are at the same position (x' =0), so the time dilation factor applies. So t = gamma * t'.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). Let me compute that.

v = 60,000 km/s. c is 300,000 km/s.

v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km²/s²).

c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km²/s²).

So v²/c² = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04 → 4%.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = gamma * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 seconds.

But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So the distance is v * t. So v is 60,000 km/s, and t is 51.03 seconds.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close to this. But let me check the actual gamma value more accurately.

Wait, calculating gamma more precisely:

v = 6e4 km/s.

v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km^2/s^2).

c = 3e5 km/s.

v²/c² = 3.6e9 / (9e10) ) = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062.

So t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

Distance = 60,000 * 51.031 ≈ 3,061,860 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. Option B is 3,000,000 km, which is smaller, and option C is 2,880,000 km, which is lower. Option A is 2,940,000 km, which is also lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because maybe the problem doesn't require considering time dilation, perhaps it's simply a relative velocity problem, and the distance is the product of velocity and time.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The problem says both frames are inertial, and we are to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame experiences 50 seconds.

So, in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer due to time dilation. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the dilated time.

So, the steps are:

1. Calculate gamma: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (6e4)^2/(3e5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062.

2. Time in Galaxy's frame, t = gamma * t' = 1.02062 *50 ≈51.031 seconds.

3. Distance is v * t = 6e4 km/s *51.031 s ≈3,061,860 km.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So I think that's the answer.

But wait, another thing: perhaps the problem assumes that the velocity is non-relativistic, so time dilation isn't considered, and the distance is just v * t. But in that case, v =60,000 km/s, t=50 s. 6e4 *50=3e6 km, which is option B. But that can't be right because the problem's scenario implies relativistic speeds.

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting confused about the direction of relative velocity. Let me check the velocity addition again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's possible that the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So the distance it travels in that frame during t seconds is v * t.

But t is not the same as the ejecta's frame. So I think the correct approach must account for time dilation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach, so it's simply 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that ignores the time dilation effect which is present here.

Hmm.

Wait, let's reevaluate the velocity. Because in the problem statement, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So using the velocity addition formula, we can find the actual velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.

The formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

But in this case, u' is the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame, which is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta (so u'= -60,000 km/s if we take positive as the direction the ejecta is moving in the Galaxy's frame).

Wait, perhaps it's more precise to use the inverse formula. Because in S, the ejecta's velocity is u, and in S', the velocity is u'.

Wait, the correct formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² ), where v is the velocity of S' relative to S, along the x-axis.

But in this problem, S' is the ejecta's frame, which is moving at velocity u relative to S (Galaxy's frame). So v = u.

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity of S' relative to S is u, which is the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame. So v = u.

So in the problem, the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame (u') is given as -60,000 km/s (if positive is the direction the ejecta is moving in the Galaxy's frame).

So substituting into the formula:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

But since v = u, this becomes (u - u)/(1 - u²/c² ) = 0/(...)= 0. That's not possible, so I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it correctly. Let me define:

In the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v (towards the center, so positive).

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving at velocity u' = -60,000 km/s (since it's approaching the ejecta, which is at rest in S').

So, using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/c² )

where V is the velocity of S' (ejecta's frame) relative to S (Galaxy's frame). Since the ejecta is moving at velocity v in S, then in S', the velocity of S relative to S' is -v. So V = v.

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity of S' relative to S is V. So if the ejecta is moving at v in S, then S' is moving at velocity V = v relative to S.

So the formula becomes:

u' = (v - V) / (1 - (v V)/c² )

But V is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v.

So substituting,

u' = (v - v)/(1 - v²/c² ) = 0/( ... ) = 0.

That can't be right because the problem states that u' is -60,000 km/s. So this suggests that my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should have taken into account the direction. Let me reorient the axes so that the positive direction is the direction the ejecta is moving. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta's velocity is v = +60,000 km/s. Then, in S', the velocity of the Galaxy (u') is -60,000 km/s (since in S', the Galaxy is approaching the ejecta, which is at rest in S').

So applying the formula, u' = (v - V)/(1 - (v V)/c² )

Since V is the velocity of S' relative to S, which is v (because the ejecta is moving at v in S). So substituting V = v:

u' = (v - v)/(1 - v²/c² ) = 0/( ... ) = 0.

But the problem says u' is -60,000 km/s, not zero. So I must have made a mistake in how I'm applying the velocity addition formula.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the correct formula for the velocity of the Galaxy in the ejecta's frame. Let me think: in S (Galaxy's frame), the Galaxy is stationary (u =0), and the ejecta is moving at v. So in S', the ejecta's frame, the velocity of the Galaxy is u' = (0 - v)/(1 - (0*v)/c² ) )= -v.

But according to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, so u' = -60,000 km/s (if positive is the direction the ejecta is moving in S). So -v = -60,000 → v =60,000 km/s.

So in S, the ejecta is moving at v =60,000 km/s.

So now, the problem is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

In S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at v =60,000 km/s. So in 50 seconds of the ejecta's frame, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time experienced in each frame is different. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t') due to time dilation.

So t = gamma * t'

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/sqrt(1 - (6e4)^2/(3e5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1- (3.6e9)/(9e10)) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.0206.

So t = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

Thus, the distance traveled is v * t =6e4 km/s *51.03 s ≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta in both the Galaxy's frame (S) and the ejecta's frame (S'). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Velocity and Frame Transformation**:  
   - In the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  
   - In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at \( u' = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  
   - Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the velocity of the ejecta in S is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Time Dilation**:  
   - The problem specifies that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (\( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \)).  
   - Due to time dilation, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to \( t' \) by the Lorentz factor:  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
     \]  
     Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]  
     Thus,  
     \[
     t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
     \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   - The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
     \]  
     Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):  
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - The closest option to the calculated distance is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
