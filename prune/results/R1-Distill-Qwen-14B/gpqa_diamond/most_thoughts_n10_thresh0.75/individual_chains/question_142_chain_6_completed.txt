Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question gives a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D with different coordinate tuples.

First, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = p|0><0| + (1-p)|1><1|, but wait, I'm not sure if that's the only form. Oh, right, there's also the case where the qubit is in a mixed state, which would involve coherences as well.

The given matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. 

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2, the matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5. I remember that a diagonal density matrix like this represents a completely mixed state. So the qubit is in a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability.

Now, how does this relate to the geometrical position in the qubit space? Oh, right, in the Bloch sphere representation! The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. 

In the Bloch sphere, any qubit state can be represented as a vector r = (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically, the components are <σ_x>, <σ_y>, <σ_z>. 

So for a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. Here, I is the identity matrix. 

Let me plug in ρ into this formula. Our ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0,0.5]], which is the same as (I)/2. So setting ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, we get (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives r·σ = 0. 

What does r·σ equal to? It's the sum of x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z. Each σ matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]] respectively. If the sum of these multiplied by x, y, z equals zero matrix, then each component must be zero.

So let's compute each term. The x component (σ_x) is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So x multiplied by σ_x is [[0, x],[x, 0]]. Similarly, y σ_y is [[0, -iy],[iy, 0]], and z σ_z is [[z, 0], [0, -z]].

Adding all together, the matrix becomes:

[ [z, x - iy], 
  [x + iy, -z] ]

This must be equal to the zero matrix. So setting each element to zero:

z = 0
x - iy = 0 → x = 0 and y = 0 (since x and y are real numbers)

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the state is a completely mixed state with no coherence and equal probabilities for both basis states. So in the Bloch sphere, it's at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal diagonal elements, indicating a completely mixed state where the qubit is in a classical mixture of \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of 0.5. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit state is represented as a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\). The general form of a density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\). For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

which implies \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This means all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero: \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 0\). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space corresponds to the origin \((0, 0, 0)\).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the state is a completely mixed state located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
