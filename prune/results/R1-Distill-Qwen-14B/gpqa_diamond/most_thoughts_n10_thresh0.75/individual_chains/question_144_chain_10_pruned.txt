Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and it's asking for the mean decay distance. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D with various values in meters.

Hmm, I remember that particles that are resonances usually have very short lifetimes because they're unstable. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives on average and how fast it's moving. So the steps I think I need to take are: calculate the lifetime of the particle first, then find its velocity, and then multiply the two to get the distance.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The mean lifetime is related to the width of the particle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the lifetime (τ) and the energy width (Γ) are related by τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But I think for unstable particles, the mean lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ/2), because the width Γ is the total decay width, which is the sum of all the decay channels. So the uncertainty in energy is Γ/2, so the uncertainty in time is ħ/(Γ/2) = 2ħ/Γ. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, the formula I recall is τ = ħ/(Γ), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The natural linewidth is Γ, and the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So if ΔE is Γ, then Δt is ħ/(2Γ). But mean lifetime is about the average time before decay. So I think the mean lifetime τ is ħ/(Γ), but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, sometimes it's ħ/(2Γ) for the uncertainty. Hmm, I should probably check that.

Wait, another approach. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. Or is it Γ = ħ/(2τ)? I think the correct relation is Γ = ħ/τ. Because in quantum mechanics, the lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width via the Planck constant. So τ = ħ/(Γ). But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another way: the decay rate Γ is the total width, and it's Γ = ħ
