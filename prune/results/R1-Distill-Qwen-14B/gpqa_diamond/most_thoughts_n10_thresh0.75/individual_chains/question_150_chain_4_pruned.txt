Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down my thoughts as I go through it.

First, the question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and I need to figure out what the compound is, then determine the product after a series of reactions. The reactions involve NaNO2 and HCl, then water, and finally aqueous KOH with heat.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR spectrum has the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, the chemical shifts can give clues about the functional groups present. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton (RCHO). Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets, but sometimes they can split into multiplets depending on neighboring protons. Wait, but this is a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's an aldehyde with adjacent protons?

Wait, but in some cases, coupling can cause splitting. Like if the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system or has neighboring protons. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with an electron-withdrawing group like nitro? But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, one N and one O. Let me think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, one ring (benzene, which is 3 double bonds and a ring, so 4 degrees), plus an aldehyde (a double bond) and another double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. But an aldehyde is usually a singlet, so why a triplet? Oh wait, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Like, the aldehyde is next to a double bond, which would cause coupling. For example, in a compound like CH2=CHCHO, the aldehyde proton would be adjacent to the CH2, leading to a triplet perhaps. Or maybe the aldehyde is part of an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, which would cause coupling with two protons on either side. Wait, but in the case of an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, like RCH=CHCHO, the aldehyde
