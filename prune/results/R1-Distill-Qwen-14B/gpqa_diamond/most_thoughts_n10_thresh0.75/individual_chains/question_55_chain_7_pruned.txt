Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is. Let's take it step by step. First, let me read the question again.

The compound is either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data given is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm. So I need to analyze each peak and see what it tells me about the structure.

Starting with the acetate group. Acetate esters typically have a CH3 group attached to the oxygen. In the NMR, the singlet at 2.1 ppm with 3H probably corresponds to that methyl group. So that makes sense for an acetate.

Looking at the other peaks. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, the notation is dq, which I think stands for doublet of quartets. Or maybe a doublet with coupling to two different sets of protons. Or perhaps it's a doublet with some splitting due to neighboring groups. Wait, no, in NMR terms, the letters after the number indicate the splitting. So the 5.5 is a doublet of quadruplets? Or a doublet with some other kind of splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets? Or perhaps a multiplet? I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh wait, the notation is 'dq' which I think is a doublet of quadruplets. But that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets (dd) or a triplet, but in any case, it's a proton that's split into more than one peak.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests it's a trans coupling in a double bond. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another vinyl proton.

Let me think about the possible structures.

The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, in cis and trans configurations.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- maybe? Or is propenyl the same as allyl? Let me think. Propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, propenyl would have a double bond. So propenyl is either CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, propenyl is allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-, but that's three carbons. Wait, wait. Propenyl could be either CH2=CHCH2OAc or CH3CH=CH-OAc? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure of the ester. The ester is R-OAc, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl acetate, the R group is CH2=
