Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answers. Let me read through the question again.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base. Wait, no, wait. Wait, KH is a base, but in some cases, it can act as a deprotonating agent. Or maybe it's used in elimination reactions or for deprotonating to form enolates.

Wait, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol... Let me visualize the structure. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. So, in this case, the spiro atom is the 1-position, which is also a vinyl group (CH2CH2 connected to the spiro). The formula is a bit complicated, but the key is that it's a spiro ring system with an enol group (the -ol indicates an alcohol). So, the alcohol is on the same carbon as the vinyl group.

When an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, what reaction typically occurs? I think it's deprotonation to form an alkoxide. But wait, if the molecule has an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group or another functional group), the base might abstract that, leading to an elimination or perhaps a cyclization.

Alternatively, since the starting material is a dienol (with both a double bond and an alcohol group), maybe the base abstracts a proton leading to a conjugate base that could undergo some kind of ring-forming reaction. Or perhaps it's an enol ether formation.

Wait, another thought: 1-vinylspiro compound might undergo a process called vinylogous elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate base that forms a more stable structure by rearrangement.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The reaction is in THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and then H+ is added. So, the base (KH) deprotonates something, and then upon protonation, perhaps an elimination occurs.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Since the starting material is a spiro compound, perhaps under basic conditions, the molecule undergoes some kind of cyclization to form a more stable cyclic structure.

Wait, I think I remember something about enolates. If the alcohol is on a spiro ring, the base could deprotonate the alpha position, leading to an enolate. But in this case, the spiro ring has a double bond, so maybe that's involved.

Alternatively, the alcohol could be converted into an oxide or something else. Wait, but the solvent is THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. Let me think about what happens when an alcohol is treated with a strong
