Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So, the problem is about the dissociation of this complex. The K here is the formation constant, which tells us about the stability of the complex.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where EDTA binds to Ca²+ ions. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The higher the K, the more stable the complex is.

So, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Under ideal pH conditions, I think we can assume that the EDTA is in the correct form (probably deprotonated enough) to form the complex. So, the complex is dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Let me write the dissociation equation:
CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, so the dissociation constant K_d (which is 1/K) would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Because K for formation is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]), so K_d is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 1/K.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M minus whatever dissociates. But since K is very large (because 5e10 is a big number), the complex is very stable. That means it doesn't dissociate much. So, the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- produced from dissociation will be very small compared to the initial concentration.

Let me denote the change as x. So, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- at equilibrium will each be x. The concentration of the complex will be approximately 0.02 - x, which is approximately 0.02 because x is so small.

So, the expression for K_d is (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x:
x² = (2e-11) * 0.02
x² = 4e-13
x = sqrt(4e-13)
x = 2e-6.5. Wait, let me compute that. The square root of 4 is 2, and 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Hmm, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 6.5 is 13/2, so yeah.

So, 2e-6.5? Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 times 10^-6.5. Wait, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That seems to match.

Wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I get confused with the exponents.

Another approach: K_d = x² / [CaEDTA] = 2e-11. [CaEDTA] is approx 0.02, so x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. As I thought earlier, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is C.

I don't think I'm making any mistake here. The K is very large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much, hence the concentration of free Ca²+ is small, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the reciprocal of \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \)). Let the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
