Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction, and the options are given in kcal and kJ. Wait, but the question's options mix both units, so I should probably pay attention to that. Oh, but wait, I think the answer would use one unit or the other, so maybe I should calculate everything in either kJ or kcal and see which option it matches.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, the problem is a bit more complicated because we have two acids (HCl and H2SO4) and a base (Ba(OH)2). So I need to figure out how much of each acid and base we have and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break this down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the moles of each substance.
HCl is a strong acid, and each molecule provides one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but each molecule can provide two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each molecule provides two OH- ions.

So, moles of HCl: Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 1 H+, so 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. So the total H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. But need to see if there's excess H+ or OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when they react, H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So each mole of H+ will react with a mole of OH-.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. All 0.2 OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 H+ left unreacted.

Wait, but the problem states that
