Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) is different from the time measured by someone on Earth.

Alright, the scenario: There's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. Now, they're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it will take for him to reach Earth from his own perspective.

Wait, the options are given, so the answer is one of them. Let me think about what the question is asking. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so this is proper time, right? Because time dilation affects the moving observer's time.

But wait, also, I think we need to calculate the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. I don't remember the exact distance, but I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me confirm that. Oh, wait, I think it's roughly about 160,000 light-years. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years. Maybe the problem expects me to use a specific value, but perhaps it's given in the problem? No, wait, the problem doesn't provide the distance, so I must have to figure it out from the data given.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is about the time experienced by the astronaut based on the speed given and the distance. Let me think.

Wait, no, the problem says that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 c. So, the speed v is 0.99999987 c.

But to find the time experienced by the astronaut, we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (the astronaut's frame). Proper time is calculated using the formula:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Where τ is the proper time (the astronaut's time), and t is the time measured in the Earth's frame (the time it takes to travel from Earth to the spacecraft's position, I suppose, but wait, the direction matters here).

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the distance between the two points. Let's say the distance is D, as measured in Earth's frame. At speed v, the time taken in Earth's frame is t = D / v.

But the astronaut's proper time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, first, I need to find D, the distance. The problem doesn't give it, but the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Let me take D ≈ 163,
