Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I need to figure out the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by this process. The question gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so we're talking about really high-energy gamma-rays here.

I remember that when high-energy gamma-rays interact with the CMB photons, they can annihilate each other, producing electron-positron pairs. This process is called pair production, I think. But wait, the exact process is gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-. So I'm dealing with two photons: one high-energy gamma and one CMB photon.

The key here is to find the energy where the mean lifetime of the gamma-rays is determined by this annihilation process. So, I need to calculate the energy where the photon's lifetime is about equal to the time it would take for this interaction to occur.

I think the way to approach this is by using the concept of photon-photon cross-section and the relation between interaction probability and density of CMB photons. The cross-section for this process might depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon.

Wait, the cross-section sigma for two-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs probably has a certain dependence on the energies. I recall that the cross-section increases with the square of the energy or something like that. Or maybe it's proportional to the cube of the energy? Hmm, maybe I need to think about the threshold energy for this process.

The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron and positron. So, the sum of their energies needs to be at least 2mcÂ². The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so each pair would require twice that, so 1.022 MeV in total. But wait, in this case, since one photon is the CMB photon (low energy) and the other is the gamma, we can set up the condition that the gamma's energy plus the CMB photon's energy must be above 1.022 MeV.

So, for the CMB photon energy E_cmbr = 1e-3 eV, which is way less than the threshold. So the gamma must have energy E such that E +
