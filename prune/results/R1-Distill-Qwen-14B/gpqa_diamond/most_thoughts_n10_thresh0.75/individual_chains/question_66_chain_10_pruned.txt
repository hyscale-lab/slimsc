Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, first, I should remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial reference frames. Poincare symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translations, so it's like the bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and momentum conservation. Oh right, so Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry. But the question is which symmetries must all operators respectâ€”so maybe I need to think about which are more fundamental.

CP symmetry is charge conjugation combined with parity. And CPT symmetry is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in the Standard Model, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry, but I'm not sure about SMEFT.

Wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model. Effective field theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, CPT symmetry, but doesn't respect CP symmetry in general because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix.

So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. But wait, Poincare is a larger symmetry. If operators
