Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it. 

The molecule is made of elements X and Y. It's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. 

The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length R, and the angular frequency w. The options are different p values.

Wait, the question specifies the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally accurate) model allows the bond length to change. But when it comes to energy levels, the rigid rotor model uses quantized rotational energy levels, while the non-rigid model might involve some vibrational changes as well. But wait, the question is about the fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest energy state, so maybe the ground state.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J*(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But in the non-rigid case, perhaps the energy levels are slightly different. Or maybe the problem is considering both rotational and vibrational energy transitions.

Wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would be the first excited state. So the molecule is initially in the ground state (fundamental state), and the photon is absorbed, causing it to transition to the next state.

But what's the selection rule here? For diatomic molecules, the selection rule for rotation is ΔJ = ±1. But for vibration, the selection rule is Δn = ±1. Wait, but the question is about the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational states. So perhaps the transition involves both rotational and vibrational changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the energy difference between two states in the model. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule's total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule can have both vibrational and rotational energy. So the total energy might be a combination of vibrational and rotational terms. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) with the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would have either a higher vibrational state (n=
