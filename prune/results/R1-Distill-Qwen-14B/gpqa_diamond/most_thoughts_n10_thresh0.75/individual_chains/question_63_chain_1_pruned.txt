Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to move the molecule to the next lowest energy state.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's moving to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Or perhaps a combination of both?

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher state. But what's the next lowest? I think the next state would be the next vibrational state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the next rotational state. Or perhaps a combination where both v and J increase. Hmm.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would likely be the first excited vibrational state, v=1, but that's higher than any rotational state transitions. Because
