Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks about right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so they're not splitting each other. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, which means it's not something like a doublet of doublets or anything like that. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis, there are two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests that the compound is one thing, but maybe there are two different forms of it. Because same mass implies the same molecular weight, so not a fragment or anything. Same intensity could mean they're present in equal amounts.

So, what's the possible explanations?

The options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. Because the LC-MS shows same mass, so that's probably not it. Plus, if it were a contaminant, the NMR might show other protons that aren't expected. So I think A is unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight and their NMR would look identical in a chiral environment. Wait, but if the NMR is run in a chiral environment, like without a chiral additive, then enantiomers would give the same NMR peaks because the instrument can't tell them apart. But in this case, the same alpha-proton has two peaks. Wait, no, because in enantiomers, all the protons are the same, so their NMR would look identical. So the NMR would just show one peak, not two. Unless the sample is racemic, but in that case, the NMR would look the same as pure compound. So B might not explain the two peaks.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means. Maybe it's something like having two different coupling partners for a proton. Wait, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So if it's not coupling to another proton, then maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the amide formation leads to some kind of diastereomerism, like in amide bonds where there are different configurations. Or perhaps during the reaction, two different diastereomers were formed, each with a different coupling, but wait, the NMR shows the same shift, just two peaks.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But in this case, the same alpha proton is giving two peaks. So if the compound has two diastereomers, each would have that alpha proton in a different environment, leading to two different shifts. Wait, but the problem states that the shifts are similar, not different. So if the shifts are similar, perhaps they're in very
