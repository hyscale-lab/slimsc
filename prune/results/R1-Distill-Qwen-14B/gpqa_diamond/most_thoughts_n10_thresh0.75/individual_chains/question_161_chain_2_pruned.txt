Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, Mike designed a high-res TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules so the electron microscopy is better. But some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spec. He found the mean free path of these gas molecules was λ1. Mean free path—oh right, that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecules, and P pressure.

So, before the electron beam is on, the mean free path is λ1. But when he turns on the electron beam, he notices the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, how does λ2 compare to λ1? The options are A to D.

Wait, what's different when the electron beam is on? The beam emits electrons, right? Those electrons would interact with the gas molecules. Oh, so when the beam is on, the electrons can cause scattering with the gas molecules. But how does that affect their mean free path?

I think about what the mean free path represents. It's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the electron beam is causing some of these collisions, perhaps the effective pressure increases because the electrons are providing another source of collisions. Or maybe it's the other way around; the electrons might ionize the gas or something, altering the gas's behavior.

Wait, another thought: in the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules collide with each other. But when the beam is active, the electrons can also collide with the gas molecules. So the total number of collisions increases because there's another source—so the mean free path would decrease because the molecules are colliding more often. Because a higher collision rate leads to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is calculated based on the pressure and temperature. Pressure here is from the gas molecules colliding with each other. The electron beam adds another factor—does it contribute to the pressure? Or does it change the effective pressure in the system?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be excited or ionized. When a gas is ionized, the mean free path can change. Ionized particles might behave differently—maybe they stick to the walls or other surfaces more, or maybe they form ions which have different sizes, hence affecting the collision cross-section.

Wait, but according to the question, the temperature remained the same. So any change in λ would be due to changes in the pressure or the collision cross-section.

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P). If the pressure P increases, λ decreases. If P decreases, λ increases. But in this scenario, the pressure in the system is given as the same because the vacuum state hasn't changed. So the pressure P is the same
