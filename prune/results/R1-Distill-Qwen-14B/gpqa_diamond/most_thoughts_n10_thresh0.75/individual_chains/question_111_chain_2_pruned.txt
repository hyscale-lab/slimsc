Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and each requires determining the major product from a reaction. Let's break them down one by one.

First, let's look at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in an elimination reaction. Wait, but waitâ€”the starting material is a ketone. Oh right, this sounds like a Claisen-Schmidt condensation or maybe a crossed aldol addition. But wait, another possibility: since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, Claisen-Schmidt is between ketones and aldehydes, but in this case, ethyl acrylate is an ester with a double bond. So perhaps it's a conjugate addition. When a ketone reacts with an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester in the presence of a strong base, maybe it's a Michael addition. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, could it be an aldol reaction where the enolate of one compound attacks the other?

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2, 2 (ethyl), and 6 (methyl). Wait, no: 2-ethyl and 6-methyl. So position 1 is the ketone. So the numbering is such that the carbonyl is at C1. Then, the substituents are at C2 (ethyl) and C6 (methyl). So, the ring is substituted at positions 1, 2, and 6. Hmm, which positions are adjacent?

Wait, in cyclohexane, position 1 is opposite to 4, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, and 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, the substituents are at 1 (CO), 2 (ethyl), and 6 (methyl). Wait, but the base is t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So, perhaps it deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

But wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and the substituents at 2 and 6 are both methyl groups? Wait no, the substituents are 2-ethyl and 6-methyl. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone (position 1) has two substituents on the same carbon (
