Okay, so I've got these two organic chemistry reactions to figure out. Let's take it step by step. The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to determine the major products A and B and choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with Reaction 1: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring where the ketone is at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. Wait, no, wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one: the numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1. So the ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and position 6 (methyl).

When t-BuOK is used with ethyl acrylate, this looks like a base-mediated reaction. Considering it's a ketone reacting with an acrylate, maybe it's a conjugate addition or a Claisen-like condensation. Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives can undergo aldol reactions, but with an acrylate ester, perhaps it's a Michael addition? Or maybe a conjugate addition.

Wait, the reaction conditions are t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. That suggests an enolate formation. So the ketone will form an enolate, which can then react with the acrylate. Alternatively, the acrylate could act as an electrophilic partner in a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, but the cyclohexanone isn't a diene, but the acrylate is a dienophile. No, that doesn't fit here because the starting material is a ketone, not a diene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate). So the
