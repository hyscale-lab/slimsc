Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the question again. We've diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh right, because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume. 

Let me calculate that. Initial moles of acetic acid: 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Diluted into 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, yeah, 0.025 M.

So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me find out how much NaOH is needed.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M × 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) is 0.001 moles. So the NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. That would mean 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25%, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, let's tackle each part: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, let's find the moles at 25% titration. Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So the moles of acetic acid remaining will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate formed will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, what's the total volume now? The original solution was 40 cm³. Then we added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³. So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 L, and [CH3COO
