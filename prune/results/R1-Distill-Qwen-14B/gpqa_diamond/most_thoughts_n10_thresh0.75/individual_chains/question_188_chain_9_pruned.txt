Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... aren't they a type of Bravais lattice with all sides equal and all angles equal? Oh right, so in a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all edges are of equal length, a, and all the angles between them are the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each. So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I think the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length of the unit cell, a, in this case. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, interatomic distance could refer to the distance between adjacent atoms, which in a simple cubic structure would be the same as a. But in a more complex structure, it might be different. Hmm, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal, which implies that the unit cell is rhombohedral. So I'm going to assume that a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance, d_{hkl}, is calculated using the formula from the Miller indices (hkl). The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h + k + l) * ( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ???) Wait, no, I think I remember the formula involving the dot product of the lattice vectors. Alternatively, I think it's given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) - (h k (cos γ) + ... ) Wait, I might be getting confused with the general case. 

Oh wait, wait, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler. But in this case, it's rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system but with all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in that case, the formula for interplanar distance involves the angles.
