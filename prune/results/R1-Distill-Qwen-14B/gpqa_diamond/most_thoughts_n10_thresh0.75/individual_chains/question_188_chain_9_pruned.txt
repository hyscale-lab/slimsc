Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all edges equal and all angles equal. Oh wait, right, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all the a, b, c lattice parameters are the same, and all the angles α, β, γ are the same too. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I think is 'a' in this case.

The interplanar distance, d, for a given plane (hkl) is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, right? The formula is d = (a)/(√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ))). Wait, I'm not sure if I got that right. Oh wait, no, wait, for a general tetragonal or other systems, but in a rhombohedral system, maybe there's a different formula since all angles are equal.

Wait, wait, maybe it's simpler than that. Oh yes, there's another formula for interplanar distance when all edges are a and angles are equal. Let me think. Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / √(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cos θ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, maybe I mixed up the sign in the formula. Because I recall that when the angles are all equal to some angle θ, the formula might have a different expression.

Wait, another approach: I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is d = 1/(√( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) ) - 2 (h k)/(a b cos γ) - ... ). Wait, no, that's probably not right. Let me think again. Oh, I think the correct formula for any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) +
