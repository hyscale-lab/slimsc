Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let's see, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. So the question is asking which of these theories doesn't need that.

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Regularization is usually needed when you have divergences in loop integrals. So theories that are "renormalizable" might require regularization during calculations, but perhaps some theories avoid this because they're free from such divergences inherently.

Wait, I think Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does require renormalization. Because when you calculate things like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get infinities, right? That's why you need to absorb them through renormalization, which involves counterterms. So C) QED probably does require regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have certain types of divergences? Or does it still require regularization? I think QCD calculations can also lead to divergences, so you might need to regularize them, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B) might need regularization.

Superstring Theory is a type of string theory which incorporates supersymmetry. String theories aim to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? I think in superstring theory, the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't produce the same types of infinities as in QFT. Because string theories calculate amplitudes using sums over strings, which might avoid the loop divergences that QFTs have. So perhaps Superstring Theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same infinities. So A) might be the answer.

Classical Electrodynamics (CED) is the non-quantum version. Since it's classical, there are no quantum divergences. But wait, the question is about high energies. Oh, but wait, in classical theories, you don't have the same issues as in quantum theories. So for example, classical CED handles Maxwell's equations without divergent integrals because
