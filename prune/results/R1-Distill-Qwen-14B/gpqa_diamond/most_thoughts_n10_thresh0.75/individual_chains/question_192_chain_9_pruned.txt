Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down. So, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, and there's an angle θ between l and s.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves in certain ways. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor being neutral, the inner surface will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. But wait, no, wait. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. So if I put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. Then, the outer surface must have +q to balance it, since the total charge is zero. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, no. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so when I add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge +q creates an electric field, and the conductor's free electrons will move to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the inner surface must have -q. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner is -q, so the outer must be +q to sum to zero.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor at point P?

I remember that for a spherical conductor with charge Q, the electric field outside is as if all the charge Q were concentrated at the center. But wait, in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be (1/(4πε₀)) (q / L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. Because the field outside a spherical shell is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the setup here is that the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. It's shifted by a distance s. So the charge inside is not at the center. But when considering the field outside the conductor, does this shift matter?

Wait, I think that for a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in such a way that their distribution is spherically symmetric. Because the conductor is neutral, but the inner charge is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. Then the outer surface has +q. But since the outer surface is a sphere (the conductor is a sphere), the +q on the outer surface will distribute uniformly. So the field outside the conductor would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor.

But wait, point P is located such that its distance from the center of the conductor is L, but its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, there's an angle θ involved. So maybe the problem is more complicated than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the induced charges inside the conductor affects the field outside. Wait, no, the conductor's own induced charge on the outer surface is what contributes to the external field. Since the outer surface is a sphere, the
