Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e, and they have negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, I think this is an electrostatics problem, probably involving electric potential energy. Because all the charges are fixed except one, but wait, no. The 13th is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P.

Wait, so the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, each of these 12 is a charge of 2e, same as the others. So, but all the 12 are at 2m from point P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

Wait, but all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, which is 2m. So, their positions form a sphere of radius 2m around P. But perhaps their exact arrangement doesn't matter because maybe the potential energy only depends on the distances between each pair. But wait, wait, the way the problem is phrased, maybe it's that each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from point P, but their mutual distances could vary. Hmm. Or perhaps they're arranged symmetrically, like equally spaced on a sphere so that the potential is minimized.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps we need to consider the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. But wait, in terms of potential energy, for point charges, the potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but each charge is 2e, so the charge of each particle is 2e. Let me think: the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law for potential energy, which is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.988 x 10^9 NÂ·
