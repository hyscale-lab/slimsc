Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass in such a system.

Right, in a regular, non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I guess special relativity effects come into play. Oh right, because when velocities approach the speed of light c, the relativistic mass increases, which would change the dynamics.

So the mass isn't just m anymore; it's gamma times m, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, how does that affect the system? The oscillator's equation of motion might change because the mass becomes relativistic.

The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². In the relativistic case, the total energy includes both kinetic and potential, but kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It should be (gamma - 1)mc², right? So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential.

Let me think about the energy conservation. At maximum displacement x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so all energy is potential. E = (1/2)kA². Wait, but wait no: in relativity, the total energy is also gamma mc², but wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA² must equal the rest energy plus any other terms. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Or maybe not, because the potential is part of the system's energy regardless. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation of motion might involve gamma. Let me recall. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is (d/dt)(gamma m v) = -k x. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can write the equation in terms of energy.

So the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so E = (1/2
