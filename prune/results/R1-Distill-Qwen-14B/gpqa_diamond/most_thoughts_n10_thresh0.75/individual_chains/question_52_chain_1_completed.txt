Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how dark spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have dark spots, their overall brightness can change, but how does that affect the ionization states or energy levels of elements in their atmosphere?

Alright, so the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of the spots is making the star cooler on average.

The main thing here is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than when there are spots. So the factor would be (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = ?

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In the problem, the ratio is n1/n2, or maybe the other way around? Wait, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Hmm, let me think about the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio of populations is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

If E2 > E1, then as T increases, the exponential term increases, making n1/n2 larger. So when T decreases, the exponential term decreases, making n1/n2 smaller. Which fits with the problem statement: when T drops (spots present), the ratio decreases.

So the ratio without spots (T=6000 K) is higher than with spots (T=5500 K). So the ratio is higher when T is higher. So when the star has no spots, the ratio is bigger. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

I need to calculate this factor. Let me denote the two ratios as R1 and R2, where R1 is without spots and R2 is with spots. So the factor is R1/R2.

Each R is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But wait, if the problem gives the wavelength corresponding to the transition, that must relate to the energy difference between the two levels. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So, E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is 1448 Angstroms. Let me calculate E in terms of k (Boltzmann's constant) so that when divided by k, it'll give me terms of temperature.

Alternatively, since in the exponent we have (E2-E1)/(k T), which is (hc/(λ k)) / T = hc/(λ k T).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact values. Let me think about the constants.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So E2 - E1 = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7)

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m
Divide by λ =1.448e-7 m:
1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J

Now, (E2-E1)/(k) = 1.372e-18 J / 1.38e-23 J/K ≈ 9.95e4 K ≈ 1e5 K

Wait, so (E2 - E1)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k T) = (1e5 K) / T.

So when T is 6000 K, this is 1e5 /6e3 ≈ 16.6667.

When T is 5500 K, it's 1e5 /5.5e3 ≈ 18.1818.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because 1e5 is 100,000. 6000 is 6e3, so 100,000 /6000 = approx 16.6667.

Similarly, 100,000 /5500 is about 18.1818.

Wait, but wait, in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1)/(k T) = (hc)/(λ k T) = (hc)/(λ k) * (1/T)

Which can be written as (hc/(λ k)) * (1/T) ), but that might not matter.

Wait, but when T increases, the denominator increases, so the entire term decreases.

Wait, but the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(k T), which is positive because E2 > E1. So when T decreases, this term becomes larger, making the exponential smaller, so n1/n2 decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement.

So the ratio R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But wait, in the problem statement, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is given. So n1/n2.

But the Boltzmann equation gives n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, I think I might have messed up. Let me get this straight.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of populations is n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So, if i is level 1 and j is level 2, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which can also be written as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So R decreases, so (n1/n2)_spotted = R2 < R1 = (n1/n2)_unspotted.

So the factor is R1 / R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Hmm, because (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So let's compute (E2-E1)/(k) = 1e5 K as approximated earlier.

So the exponent becomes 1e5 * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Let me compute 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 and 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4.

Subtracting: (1.6667e-4 - 1.8182e-4 ) = -1.515e-5.

Wait, no: wait, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, 1/T1 is 1/6000, and 1/T2 is 1/5500. So 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is (1e5) * (negative number) → negative.

So the exponent is negative, which makes the overall factor exp(negative) = a fraction less than 1.

Wait, but wait, the ratio R1 is larger than R2. The factor R1/R2 is [exp( (ΔE)/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( (ΔE)/(k T2) ) ].

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k T1) ) - (ΔE/(k T2) )) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, yes, as before. So because T2 < T1, 1/T1 < 1/T2, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.

Thus, the exponent is negative, so the factor is exp(negative) = something less than 1. But wait, R1 is bigger than R2, so R1/R2 should be greater than 1. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, because when the star has spots, the temperature is lower. So T1 is 6000 K (unspotted), T2 is 5500 K (spotted).

So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500)

Which is (ΔE/k) * ( (5500 - 6000)/(6000*5500) )

So (5500 is 5.5e3, 6000 is 6e3)

5500-6000 = -500.

So, 1/6000 -1/5500 = (-500) / (6000 *5500 )

= -500 / (33,000,000 )

= -5/(3.3e7) ? Wait, 3.3e7 is 33,000,000.

Wait, 500 / 6000 = 1/12, and 500/5500 = 1/11.

Wait, another approach: 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500 )= (-500)/(33e6) )= -500/(3.3e7 )= -1/(6.6e4 )

Wait, 500 / 3.3e7 is (5e2)/(3.3e7) ) = (5)/(3.3e5 ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 1/6000 -1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (1e5 K) * (-1.515e-5 )

Calculating that:

1e5 * (-1.515e-5) = -1.515.

So the exponent is approximately -1.515.

So the factor (R1/R2) = exp(-1.515).

Exp(-1.515) is approximately equal to e^(-1.5) is about 0.223, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.515 is about 1.515, so e^-1.515 ≈ 0.220.

Wait, but wait, the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 -1/T2) ) → which is exp(-1.515 )≈ 0.220.

Wait, but that would imply that R1 is 0.22 times R2. But that can't be right because the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning R1 > R2. So R1/R2 must be greater than 1.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let me retrace.

Ah! I think I messed up the exponent sign. Let me go back.

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

When T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases. So exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ) increases, making R larger.

Wait, but wait, when T is lower, R is higher. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so R (n1/n2) is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So something's wrong here.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. But the observed ratio of n1/n2 decreases when there are spots. So R_unspotted > R_spotted. So R_unspotted / R_spotted > 1.

So according to the calculation I did earlier, T_unspotted is 6000 K, T_spotted is 5500 K.

So R_unspotted = exp( (ΔE)/(k T1) ), and R_spotted = exp( (ΔE)/(k T2) )

So R_unspotted/R_spotted = exp( (ΔE)/(k T1) ) / exp( (ΔE)/(k T2) ) = exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k ) (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) )

Wait, but 1/6000 = approx 1.6667e-4, 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4. So 1/6000 - 1/5500 ≈ -1.515e-5.

(ΔE/k) is 1e5 K. So 1e5 * (-1.515e-5) ≈ -1.515.

So the exponent is -1.515, so the factor is e^-1.515 ≈ 0.220.

So R_unspotted/R_spotted ≈ 0.22. So the ratio when unspotted is 0.22 times the ratio when spotted. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would mean R_unspotted > R_spotted. But according to the calculation, R_unspotted is less than R_spotted.

That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I got the levels mixed up. What if I swapped E1 and E2?

Suppose E1 is higher than E2. Then the exponent would be (E2 - E1)/(k T) = negative.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if E1 > E2, then the energy difference would be negative, leading to different behavior. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So when an electron moves from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon of that wavelength. So E2 > E1 because energy is higher in level 2.

So the exponent is positive.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the ratio R = n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, for higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so R is smaller. Wait, no.

Wait, E2-E1 is positive. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller.

Thus, for higher T, exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller, so R is smaller.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when T is higher, the thermal energy is higher. So more atoms would be in the higher energy state, level 2. Thus, n2 increases, n1 decreases, so n1/n2 decreases.

So, when T increases, the ratio R = n1/n2 decreases.

So when the star has no spots, T =6000 K, and when it does have spots, T=5500 K.

So, R_unspotted = exp( (ΔE)/(k *6000) ), R_spotted = exp( (ΔE)/(k *5500) )

Since 5500 <6000, (ΔE)/(k *5500) > (ΔE)/(k *6000), so R_spotted > R_unspotted.

But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R_unspotted > R_spotted. This contradicts the calculation unless I have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I swapped the ratio.

Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2. So n1/n2. When T decreases, as per the calculation, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. Which contradicts the calculation.

So where am I going wrong?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the presence of spots leads to a lower overall Teff, but that may affect the ionization state. Wait, dark spots on a star are cooler regions. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower, so the star is cooler on average.

In a cooler photosphere, the ionization balance would change. So more neutral atoms and fewer ions.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking at neutral Ti atoms. So if the temperature is lower, the fraction of neutral Ti would increase. So for neutral Ti, the ratio between levels 1 and 2 would be higher because the lower energy state is more populated when it's cooler.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 increases if E2 > E1. So in a cooler star, more atoms are in the lower energy level, so n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So wait, that's the opposite of what I thought.

This is confusing. Let me re-express the ratio.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

So if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k*T) increases. So the exponent increases, so exp increases.

Thus, n1/n2 increases when T decreases.

So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I got the definition of the ratio wrong. Maybe it's n2/n1 that's being considered. Let me check the problem statement again.

"In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, the ratio is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. So this is a conflict.

Wait, that suggests that my initial assumption must be wrong. Maybe the energy levels are inverted? Like E1 is higher than E2.

Wait, if E1 > E2, then E2-E1 = negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) would be negative. So the exponent is negative.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

If (E2-E1) is negative, then the exponent is negative, so n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( negative )

So if E1 > E2, then when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp(negative) becomes smaller, making n1/n2 smaller.

Wait, but the problem states that when T decreases (spots present), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So if E1 > E2.

Wait, let's say E1 is higher than E2. So (E2-E1) = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive.

So ratio R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

When T decreases, 1/T increases, so -ΔE/(k T) becomes more negative. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes smaller. So R decreases.

Which is what the problem says: when T decreases, R decreases. So the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases.

So in this case, E1 > E2, which implies that the transition from E2 to E1 emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å.

Wait, that's possible. So E1 is the higher energy level, E2 is lower.

So this changes the calculation.

So the energy difference ΔE = E1 - E2 = hc/(λ) = positive.

So the exponent is -ΔE/(k T) = - (hc)/( λ k T )

So now, R = (g1/g2) * exp( - (hc)/(λ k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp is smaller, R decreases.

Which aligns with the problem statement.

So, in this case, the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Thus, when the star is unspotted, T is higher, so R is larger (since exp is bigger). When spotted, T is lower, R is smaller.

So the factor is R_unspotted / R_spotted.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Because:

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( (ΔE/k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Ah, so that's the correct expression.

Now, let's compute this.

We have ΔE = hc/(λ), which is 1.372e-18 J as before.

So, (ΔE)/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 99500 K ≈ 1e5 K.

So, (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So, the exponent becomes 1e5 * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.8182e-4, 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4.

Subtracting: 1.8182e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 0.1515e-4 = 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

So the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515 ≈ approximately what?

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^1.6 ≈ 4.953. Let's compute e^1.515.

Compute 1.515:

We can approximate using Taylor series or known values.

Alternatively, 1.515 is approximately 1.5 + 0.015.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^(1.5 +0.015) = e^1.5 * e^0.015.

e^0.015 ≈ 1 + 0.015 + (0.015)^2/2 ≈ 1.0151125.

So, 4.4817 * 1.0151125 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.015 ≈ let's compute:

4.4817 * 1 =4.4817

4.4817 * 0.015 = approx 0.0672255.

So total ≈4.4817 + 0.0672255 ≈4.5489.

So e^1.515≈ ~4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. Option D is ~2.9, which is lower.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \(E_2 > E_1\), \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases from \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) to \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). The problem states that the ratio \(n_1/n_2\) decreases when the star has spots, implying that the ratio is higher at \(T_1\) than at \(T_2\).

The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{unspotted}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spotted}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\). Using the given wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K} \approx 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 10^5 \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right).
\]

Compute \(\frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(\frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.6667 \times 10^{-4}\). Subtracting:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.8182 \times 10^{-4} - 1.6667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
10^5 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} = 1.515.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is **4.5**, corresponding to option C.
