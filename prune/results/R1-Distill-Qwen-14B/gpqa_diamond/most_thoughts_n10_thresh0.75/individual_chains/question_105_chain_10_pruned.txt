Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness variations, similar to an exoplanet transit. We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as the spots.

Alright, let me start by breaking down the given information. The star has the same radius as the Sun. So R_star is equal to R_sun. The dark spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. But wait, the star is a sphere, so covering one hemisphere with 20% spots means the total area of spots is 20% of the area of a hemisphere. Or wait, no—filling factor is probably the fraction of the star's surface covered. Oh, but the question says one hemisphere is covered with a 20% filling factor. Hmm, maybe that filling factor refers to the area on the hemisphere that's covered. So if it's a hemisphere, the area is 2πR² (since a sphere's surface area is 4πR², so a hemisphere is 2πR²). So 20% of that would be 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

But wait, maybe I should think about the star's total surface area. The star's
