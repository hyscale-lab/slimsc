Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun—same radius, right? And one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Oh wait, wait. Actually, the filling factor refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. But here, it's only one hemisphere that's spotty. Hmm, not sure yet, but I'll get back to that.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. When we observe the star, because it's rotating, the spots will come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness over time. And because these spots look like dark areas, the star's brightness will dip a bit when a spot is facing us.

The interesting part is that these brightness variations can look similar to those caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star. So the question is asking: if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same amplitude in brightness variation, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star?

So, I need to compute Rpl/Rstar such that the light curve amplitude is the same as that caused by the spots.

Let me think about how both scenarios affect the star's brightness.

First, the star's light output is due to its surface area and temperature. The total luminosity is L = 4πRstar²σTeff⁴. But when parts of the star are cooler (spots), the observed brightness changes as the spots rotate into and out of view.

When a spot is visible, it contributes less light than the surrounding area. The change in brightness, ΔL, is proportional to the area of the spot times the temperature difference. Wait, no, the flux from a spot is lower—so the dip in brightness is (Area of spot * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)) / (Teff^4 * Area of star), but relative to the total flux.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the brightness variation caused by the spots. Let's consider the star's normal flux as L0 = 4πRstar²σTeff^4. The spots contribute less flux. The total flux when a spot is visible would decrease by the area of the spots times (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) divided by the area of the star.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The flux from a spot is F_spot = σT_spot^4, and the flux from the unspotted area is F_unspotted = σTeff^4. So the total flux when a spot is present is F_total = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted + Area_spots * F_spot) / Area_total.

The fractional change in flux (ΔF/F) would be [ (F_unspotted * (1 - F)) + F_spot * F ] / F_unspotted, where F is the fraction of the area covered by spots. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the relative change as
