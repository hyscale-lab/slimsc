Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. 

So the problem is about an atomic nucleus that undergoes spontaneous fission. The initial nucleus is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. When it splits, it forms two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Wait, the rest mass of the initial nucleus is M, so M is its rest mass. But when it splits, the combined rest mass of the two fragments is only 99% of M. Oh, right, because some mass is converted into kinetic energy during the fission process. That makes sense because in nuclear reactions, some mass is lost and converted into energy, which is the kinetic energy of the fragments.

The problem asks for the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. 

So, the first thing I think I need to do is figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. Let's denote them as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 m2. 

Given that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of the initial mass. Oh wait, but the initial nucleus had a rest mass M, and the fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M, so the missing 1% is the mass converted into kinetic energy. 

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M / 3, and m1 = 2 * 0.99 M /3 = 0.66 M. 

Wait, let me double-check that math. 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M ≈ 0.33 M. So m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. 

So M is the initial rest mass, which is 300 GeV. So m1 is 0.
