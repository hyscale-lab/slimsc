Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, right. So the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer?

Wait, the options are given as A to D. Let me think about the basics. I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, in the glass, the speed would be v_glass = c/n. Since c is given as 1 here, it's 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So it's a case where the medium itself is moving. How does that affect the measurement of the light's speed by an observer?

I think this is a problem related to relative velocity. But I'm a bit rusty on how velocities add up in different frames. Oh wait, is this a problem involving special relativity? Because velocities don't just add linearly when speeds approach the speed of light. But wait, v is the velocity of the glass, and the speed of light is already 1 in vacuum. So maybe we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame
