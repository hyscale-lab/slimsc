Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass's motion affects how the light's speed is measured in the lab frame. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? Because in vacuum, c is the speed, and in a medium with index n, it's slower by that factor. So in the glass, the speed would be c/n, which is 1/n if c is taken as 1. But the glass is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving, so the lab frame is different from the glass's rest frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But when the glass is moving, the lab would see a different speed due to the relative motion.

Wait, this is a scenario involving relative velocity and maybe the addition of velocities. Oh right! The Doppler effect might come into play, but wait, Doppler is about frequency and wavelength changes when the source or observer is moving. But here, the medium itself
