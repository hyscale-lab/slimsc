Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question involves several reactions and NMR data. Let me read the problem carefully.

Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, first, I need to figure out what Compound A is. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D, which is one of the options given.

Let's start with the NMR of A. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these are probably methyl groups adjacent to another group. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests these might be methylene (CH2) groups. Also, the integration tells me there are 6 protons in one group and 4 in another.

So, considering the splitting: triplet and quartet. If the 4H are a quartet, that usually means each of these H is adjacent to two H on the neighboring group. Let me think about possible structures.

A common structure with such NMR signals is neopentyl groups. Wait, neopentyl is (CH2)C(CH3)3. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane protons are usually around 0.5-1.5 ppm, but the splitting might not fit. Alternatively, think about a di-substituted cyclohexane or something else.

Wait, another possibility: 2-methylpropane or something. Hmm. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diethyl group. Diethyl ether, maybe, but wait, diethyl ether has two triplets, maybe. Let me calculate the NMR.

Wait, diethyl ether: the ethyl groups in diethyl ether would have triplet and triplet for the CH2CH3 groups. But in this case, the triplet is at 0.9ppm for 6H (so three CH3 groups) and a quartet for 4H (two CH2 groups). That sounds more like diethyl groups connected to something else. Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2O, diethyl ether. But diethyl ether's NMR shows two triplets, each at around 1.2 ppm (for the CH3) and 3.4 ppm for the OCH2. But in this case, the triplet is at 0.9 and the quartet at 1.3, which doesn't match diethyl ether.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure with two ethyl groups attached to a central atom. Like, perhaps, 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's just neopentane, which would have a singlet for the central CH2. No, wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is (CH3)C-CH2-C(CH3)2? No, that's not right. Wait, neopentane is actually 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its structure is CH2(C(CH3)2)2? No, wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is (CH(CH3)2)2CH2? No, I
