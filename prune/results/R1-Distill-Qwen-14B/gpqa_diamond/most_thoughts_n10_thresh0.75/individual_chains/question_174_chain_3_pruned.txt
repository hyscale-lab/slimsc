Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, I guess the initial mass is M, and the two fragments have masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99*M.

Wait, no, wait. The sum of rest masses is 99% of initial mass. So initial rest mass is M, so the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99*M. So that leaves 1% of M as the mass converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, some mass gets converted into kinetic energy and possibly other forms like radiation or binding energy. But the problem says it splits into two fragments and nothing else, so maybe the rest 1% is the kinetic energy?

But wait, the problem is about the difference between the correct T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to find T1 correct relativistically and compare it to the classical value. Then find the difference.

First, let's break down the given data.

Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV. So,

E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, two fragments: m1 and m2.

Given that m1 = 2 * m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum: 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M / 3 → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero (conservation of momentum). So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let’s denote the velocities as v1 and v2. Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → because m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But wait, in non-relativistic terms, but maybe I should approach this using relativistic momentum since the kinetic energies might be significant.

Wait, but the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. The rest masses after are 0.99 M, so M is 300 GeV/c², and the sum is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, which is 3 billion eV, 3e9 eV. That's 3 GeV. But wait, in reality, nuclear fission releases a lot of energy,
