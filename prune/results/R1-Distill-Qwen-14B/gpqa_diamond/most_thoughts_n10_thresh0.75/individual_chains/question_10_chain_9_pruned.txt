Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, and I have to choose which one is the most dense. The options are all about the planet's mass, radius, and composition. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh wait, but wait—volume depends on the radius, so that's important too.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Density of Earth is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b) is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, no—the density is given, so maybe I don't have to compute it. But wait, the question is which has the highest. So here the density is 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, the mass is higher—does that affect anything? Oh no, because density is given, so the actual value is 5.5. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Since it's same composition, its density should be the same as Earth's, right? Because composition determines density. So same as a), which is 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Mass is five times Earth's. If composition is same, then
