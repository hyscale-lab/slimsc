Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked with TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots formed. I need to determine which option correctly gives the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's an addition reaction. But wait, wait. The starting material here is an ether with a substituted butenyl group attached to oxygen. So the structure is benzene with an O-linked group, which is a butenyl chain. Specifically, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that structure mentally. The butenyl chain has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure would be: the chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C3 (so between C3 and C4). The substituents on C2 are two methyl groups. So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait no, that can't be right because butenyl is four carbons. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, but the position of the double bond is important. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond at the end. But wait, 3-enyl would be but-3-enyl? No, because butenyl can have the double bond between C1-C2 (but-1-enyl), C2-C3 (but-2-enyl), or C3-C4 (but-3-enyl). Oh wait, but but-3-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C
