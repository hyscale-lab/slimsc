Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is like a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH probably leads to an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a diene or something. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide would give a different NMR. Or maybe it's undergoing a different kind of elimination.

Wait, in KOH, the reaction might be a double elimination, but for dibromides, sometimes you get a ketone if it's a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination. Vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Since adamantane has a diamondoid structure, maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both would form a ketone. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantanone. That makes sense because the IR shows a strong carbonyl peak (1720 cm⁻¹), which is typical for a ketone.

Looking at the NMR: the 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a pair of equivalent hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl. In adamantane derivatives, the hydrogen positions can be a bit tricky. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs on adjacent carbons, so when they eliminate, you'd form a ketone connecting those two carbons. So the structure would be a cyclohexane-like ring (but in adamantane, which is more of a diamond structure) with a ketone group (O) between two carbons. So the adjacent carbons would each have two hydrogens, maybe. But wait, how many hydrogens would be next to the carbonyl?

Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is connected in a specific way. Let me visualize: if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, those two Brs are on opposite faces? So when KOH is used, it might form a ketone bridge, leading to 1,3-adamantanone. So the structure would have a keto group, and the adjacent carbons would each have two hydrogens. So the NMR peak at 4.79 (2H) might be those two equivalent hydrogens next to the carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests some equivalent protons in a rigid structure, maybe the other hydrogens on the adamantane ring. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set, perhaps on a bridge or something.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone.

Next, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, 1,3-adamantanone is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an acylium ion. Wait, but 1,3-adamantanone is already a ketone. Maybe the Lewis acid is helping in some kind of ring expansion or forming an enolate? Or perhaps the ketone is being used in a Friedel-Crafts scenario, but that doesn't directly apply here.

Wait, another thought: heating a ketone with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3 might lead to some kind of acetylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement? No, that's for allyl vinyl ethers. Wait, another possibility is that the ketone is undergoing a aldol condensation, but without another carbonyl, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation if there's an aromatic ring, but adamantane is not aromatic. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, 1,3-adamantanone has a ketone group. When treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it forms an acylium ion? But wait, that's typically for Friedel-Crafts, which requires an acylium ion and an aromatic ring. But adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that's more for 1,2-diols. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes. No, I don't think so. Or perhaps it's a kind of elimination or addition. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid is causing the ketone to react in some way. Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions are heating, so perhaps the amide is formed? Wait, no, the product is product 2, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethylsulfide is added to form product 3. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it.

So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, when product 1 (1,3-adamantanone) is treated with Al(OiPr)3 and heated, it forms product 2, which has a double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1, which is a ketone, undergoes a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a aldol-like reaction, but without an alpha hydrogen, perhaps not. Wait, wait: 1,3-adamantanone structure. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-adamantanone would have a ketone at position 1 and 3. So maybe when heated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the ket
