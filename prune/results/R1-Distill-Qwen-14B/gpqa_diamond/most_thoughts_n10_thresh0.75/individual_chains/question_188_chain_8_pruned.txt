Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a lattice parameter, right? So I think the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstrom here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal structure. The formula for interplanar distance (d) is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles?), but wait, I think it's more precise than that. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit different because the angles are not 90 degrees. 

Wait, the general formula for d_{hkl} in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is 1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin² α)) + ... Wait, no, that's for a general hexagonal or cubic system. Maybe I should recall the specific formula for a rhombohedral system since all edges are equal and all angles are same.

Rhombohedral systems are a special case where a = b = c, and all angles equal. So the interplanar distance formula simplifies. I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ). Wait, no, maybe the formula has some terms adjusted for the angles.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance for a crystal with lattice parameter a and Miller indices hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ...). But when the crystal is not cubic, the formula includes terms involving the angles. Maybe it's better to use the general formula for interplanar distance, which is 1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin² α)) + (k²/b²)(1/(sin² β)) + (l²/c²)(1/(sin² γ)) ) + ... but wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula d = (a)/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 hk cos β + 2 hl cos γ + 2 kl cos α )) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. 

Wait, another thought: I remember that for a cubic system, it's simple: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or maybe it's a different system. Let me think. No, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system in terms of symmetry but with all edges equal and angles same but not 90 degrees.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system (which is a special case where a = b = c and α = β = γ) is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ). Since in this case, α=β=γ=30 degrees, and a=10 Angstrom, and the plane is (111), so h=k=l=1.

Let me plug in the numbers. So h, k, l are all 1.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) )

Wait, let's compute each term step by step.

First, h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1=3.

Then, 2hk cos α = 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) =
