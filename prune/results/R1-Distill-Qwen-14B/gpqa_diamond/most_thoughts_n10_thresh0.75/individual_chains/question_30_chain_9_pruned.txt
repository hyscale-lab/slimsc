Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that when a compound absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light matches the energy gap between two molecular orbitals. Oh right, the color we see is the complementary color of the absorbed light. 

The question says the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits another. Or is it that the absorbed light corresponds to the energy gap, and the emitted light is what we see? Or maybe I'm getting it backwards. Oh wait, no, the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and appears as the complementary color. So the color emitted (or transmitted) is the color we see, and the absorbed is the opposite.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. But wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy gap between the excited state and the ground state. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one? Or is it the same? Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me think. When a dye is excited, it absorbs a photon with
