Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds in a detector. Hmm, I remember that ultra-relativistic means their speed is very close to the speed of light, so we probably need to use some relativity concepts here. 

The problem states that when particles are collided, new particles are produced. These particles travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls instead.

Wait, so initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it. We're looking for a higher Lorentz factor that allows two-thirds to reach. So, the idea is that with a higher gamma (Lorentz factor), the particles would live longer, right? Because their lifetime is dilated in their own frame, which from the lab frame's perspective, they have a longer lifetime, allowing them to travel further.

But wait, in this case, the particles are fast decaying. So their lifetime is important. The detector is a sphere with a radius of 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the inner wall, the distance it needs to cover is 30 meters. The time it has is determined by its lifetime.

So the key here is probably the proper lifetime of the particle versus the dilated lifetime as seen in the lab frame. 

Let me think. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, which is the shortest possible. The lab frame sees a longer lifetime because of time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector's wall is the distance divided by its speed. But since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c.

So the time is t = distance / speed ≈ (30 m) / (c) ≈ 30 / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, or 100 nanoseconds. Wait, 3e8 is 300 million, so 30 / 3e8 is 1e-7, yeah.

But the actual time the particle has is its lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So for the particle to reach the wall, we need gamma * tau (proper lifetime) >= t.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma * tau. So the particle will decay after gamma * tau seconds. So if gamma * tau is greater than t, the time it takes to reach the wall, then the particle will reach the detector. Otherwise, it decays before.

Wait, but the initial setup is that with gamma=20, one third reach the walls. So that suggests that there's a 1/3 probability that the lifetime is longer than t. Hmm, but wait, no. Because particles either live long enough to reach the wall or they decay before. So perhaps it's about the fraction of particles whose lifetime
