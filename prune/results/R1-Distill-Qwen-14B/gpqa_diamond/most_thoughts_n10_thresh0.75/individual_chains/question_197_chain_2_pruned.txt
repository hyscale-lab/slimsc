Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let's break down the information given.

First, the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad area that probably indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's an NMR later, I can think more about that. Then, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: The signals are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). That's really high, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton since those are typically around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes carboxylic acid protons can be around 10-12 ppm and are broad. Also, the IR at 1720 could be a ketone or an aldehyde. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Let me list out the NMR peaks:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (maybe a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde)
- 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H) — probably aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted
- 7.2 ppm, doublet (2H) — more aromatic protons, maybe in the same substitution pattern
- 2.9 ppm, multiplet (1H) — could be a CH next to something, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl group
- 1.7 ppm, multiplet (2H) — maybe adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a chain
- 1.4 ppm, doublet (3H) — perhaps a methyl group attached to something, like a CH2CH(CH3)
- 0.9 ppm, triplet (3H) — likely a CH2CH2CH3 group (ethyl)

Putting this together, maybe the aromatic ring has substituents. The doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, maybe something like a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a big clue. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be broad around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid. Then, the IR at 1720 would make sense for a carboxylic acid (since O-H is broad in IR too, but wait the IR first range is 3400–2500, which is O-H stretch for the carboxylic acid. So that fits.

So the compound has a benzene ring, substituents in para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and the other is maybe a chain with a CH2CH(CH3) group. Wait, looking at the NMR: the 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm signals.

Let me think about the structure. Suppose the benzene has a COOH group in one para position and another substituent in the opposite. The substituent is a chain that's connected perhaps via a CH group (the 2.9 ppm peak is a multiplet, 1H, maybe a CH that's next to a carbonyl or something else).

Wait, the substituent could be a propyl group or something similar. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group because the triplet at 0.9 would be from the ethyl group attached to the CH2. Like, maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3, but the 1.4 is a doublet so perhaps it's a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3).

Wait, if I have an ethyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH, which is attached to the benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group in some arrangement. Let's think of the substituent as a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a secondary butyl group would be (CH2)2CHCH3, but wait, perhaps the structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- or another arrangement.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let's see the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): maybe the central CH in a chain, like CH connected to two CH2 groups or something else.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group next to the CH and maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH(CH3) group, so like a methyl group attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): an ethyl group, perhaps as a CH2CH3.

So putting that together, the substituent on the benzene could be a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-? No, wait. Let's try to piece this together.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a CH2 group and a CH(CH3), but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl
