Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think about each compound one by one.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they can't be superimposed on their mirror images. So the compound must have a non-superimposable mirror image, which usually means having at least one chiral center. Alternatively, some other factors like allenes or certain planar structures with multiple double bonds can lead to chirality, but that's probably beyond the basics here.

The compounds given are four in number, and the options are combinations of these. Let's take them one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down. It's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, which are the ortho positions relative to the connecting bond. Also, there are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions on each ring.

Wait, so each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester (since it's dimethyl). So the structure is something like two benzene rings connected at 1 and 1', with nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and the ester groups at 2 and 2'.

Now, can this molecule have chiral centers? Well, looking at each ring, are there any chiral centers? Let's see. The ester groups are at 2 and 2'; the substituents on each benzene ring are at positions 2, 6, and the connecting position.

Wait, wait. The biphenyl system itselfâ€”biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, we're looking for a center with four different substituents. But in biphenyls, especially when the substituents are symmetrical, the molecule might not have a chiral center.

Wait, but let me think again. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So each ring
