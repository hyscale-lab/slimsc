Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star with some specific parameters. So let's read it carefully.

The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the astronomers are looking at the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, the transition between these levels is at approximately 1448 Ã…, which is in the ultraviolet range. The photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy factor), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But wait, in spots, the temperature is different. Are the spots cooler? The problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere drops. So the spots are probably cooler than the surrounding.

But wait, perhaps during the measurement, when the spots are present, the average T_eff is 5500 K. So the ratio of the two levels would depend on the temperature. The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on 1/T.

The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So when T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Let me think about this: for higher energy levels, higher temperature means more excitation. So if the star is cooler, fewer atoms are in the higher energy level.

Wait, correction: The Boltzmann factor is exp(-
