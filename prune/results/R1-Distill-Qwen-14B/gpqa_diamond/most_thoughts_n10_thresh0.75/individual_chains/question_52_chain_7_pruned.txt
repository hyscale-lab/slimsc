Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what I can come up with.

Okay, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's photosphere can be explained using the Boltzmann equation, which relates the number of particles in two states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states. The equation is something like (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of the level, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K). But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, right? So when parts of the star are covered by spots, those regions are cooler than the rest. But in this problem, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the average T is lower.

But wait, how does the ratio of Ti levels depend on the temperature? The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So if the ratio is n1/n2, wait, let me think. Because the problem says the ratio of n1 to n2 (level 1 to level 2) decreases when there are spots. So let me clarify: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = ?

Wait, no. The ratio observed is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, it's lower. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, but wait, the ratio is n1/n2. Let's think about the Boltzmann equation. For a two-level system, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the energy levels are such that level 2 is higher than level 1, then ΔE is positive. So, higher T would make the ratio (n2/n1) larger, because the exponential term increases. So, if the star has lower T, n2/n1 decreases, which makes n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) increase. Wait no, no. Wait, wait.

Let me write it down:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT))

If T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases, which implies that n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting with what I just thought.

Wait, no. Let me check again. The question says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the
