Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromo group and a nitro group. Additionally, the ketone (ethan-1-one) is attached to the benzene. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (probably from acetophenone?), a nitro group at position 5, and a bromine at position 3.

I remember that when substituents are added to benzene, the order in which they are introduced matters because of directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine can be either ortho/para (if added via electrophilic substitution) or meta (if via other methods).

Wait, the target has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So, the benzene must have two substituents: one at position 3 and another at position 5. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's imagine numbering the positions such that the ketone is at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 would be meta to each other. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), both meta to the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (which is at position 1 of ethan-1-one, so the ketone is on the benzene ring as a substituent). The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is position 1, then substituents at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So the benzene ring has three substituents: a ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. Wait, that would make the ring substituents at positions 1,3,5. So, all three substituents are at 1,3,5, but how does that work? Because benzene is a six-membered ring, so 1,3,5 are every other position, so it's a tri-substituted ring with substituents at every other carbon. That's possible.

But wait, when adding substituents, each step affects where the next substituent goes. Let's think about the synthesis steps.

The starting material is benzene. The target has a ketone group (like in acetophenone), a nitro group, and a bromine. So, how to introduce these groups in the correct positions.

Let me outline possible steps.

First, introducing the ketone. Acetophenone can be made by Friedel-Crafts acylation with benzene using CH3COCl and AlCl3 as catalyst. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is activated enough for this, so first step could be adding the ketone.

Wait, but nitration and bromination are meta-directing. So, if the ketone is an activating group, but wait: acetophenone has a ketone group which is deactivating (because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl) and meta-directing. So, when adding substituents after the ketone is attached, the next substituent would go meta to the ketone.

So, let's say the first step is Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone. Now, the ring has a ketone at position 1 (let's say), which is deactivating and meta-directing.

Next, we need to add a nitro group at position 5 relative to the ketone. Wait, but wait, where would the nitration occur? If the ketone is at position 1 (which is, say, the top of the ring), then meta would be positions 3 and 5. So, if the ring is already substituted at position 1, adding a nitro group next would go into position 3 or 5, which are meta to the ketone.

Wait, but nitration is a strong meta director. So, in the presence of the ketone (meta director), the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. So, first, add the ketone, then nitrate.

Wait, but then the next substituent needs to be a bromine. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the target has both nitro and bromine substituents. So, perhaps the nitration and bromination are done in a specific order.

Alternatively, maybe I should first nitrate the benzene, then introduce the ketone, and then brominate. Let's think about that.

Wait, if I first nitrate benzene, that would add a nitro group in one position, say position 1. Then, introducing the ketone via Friedel-Crafts would require activating the ring, but nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Friedel-Crafts doesn't work on deactivated rings. So that approach won't work. So, adding nitro first is not feasible if we need to add a ketone later because the ring would be too deactivated.

So, perhaps the correct order is to add the ketone first, which is activating (Wait, no, acetophenone's ketone is deactivating. Oh, wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group, which is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Wait, no. Wait, the acyl group is deactivating because it's electron-withdrawing, but it is a meta director. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the acyl group (like in acetophenone) is a meta director. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, it deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions. So, if I have acetophenone, and then I nitrate it, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the ketone.

Similarly, if I then brominate, the bromine would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, but considering existing substituents.

Wait, but in the target molecule, there are two substituents besides the ketone. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts acylation).
2. Introduce the nitro group (nitration) in the meta position relative to the ketone.
3. Introduce the bromine (bromination) in another position.

Wait, but the target has bromo at 3 and nitro at 5, if the ketone is at position 1. So, positions 3 and 5 are both meta to the ketone. So, after the ketone is added, nitration would go into position 3 or 5, and then bromination would go into the other.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group and meta-directing. So, after the first substitution (ketone), adding nitro would go meta to the ketone. Then, bromination would be directed by both the ketone and nitro groups.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring has two substituents: ketone and nitro. The ketone is at position 1, nitro at 3, let's say. Then, when we brominate, the directing effects of both substituents must be considered. The nitro group is meta-directing, the ketone is also meta-directing. So, where would the bromine go?

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine can be introduced before the nitro group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's outline possible steps:

Option 1:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1: ketone).
2. Nitration → nitro group at position 3 (meta to ketone).
3. Bromination → where does the bromine go? Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro), both meta directors. So, for bromination, the possible positions are 5 (meta to ketone) or 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3, so meta would be position 6 or 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions more carefully. Let's number the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para to the ketone.

After adding the ketone at 1, nitration would occur at position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (nitro).

Now, when we brominate, the substituents at 1 and 3 will direct. The ketone at 1 is meta director, and the nitro at 3 is also a meta director. So, possible bromination positions are:

- For the ketone: meta would be position 5 (since 1's meta is 3 and 5). But position 3 is already occupied by nitro.

- For the nitro group: meta positions would be 6 and 2 (since 3's meta is 6 and 2). Wait, no. Let me think: the nitro group is at position 3. The meta positions relative to 3 would be positions 6 and 2 (since benzene is a ring). So, if I brominate now, the available positions would be 2, 4,5,6.

But the existing substituents are 1 and 3. So, the possible positions for bromine would be 2,4,5,6.

But the directing effects: the ketone (1) is meta-directing, so directs to 5. The nitro (3) is meta-directing, so directs to 6 and 2.

So, the most activated position would be where the directors agree. Are there any positions where both substituents direct incoming electrophile?

Let me see: position 5 is meta to ketone (1), which wants to direct there. But nitro at 3 would direct to positions 6 and 2, not 5. So, position 5 is only directed by the ketone. Position 6 is meta to nitro (3), but not directed by the ketone. Position 2 is also meta to nitro, but not directed by the ketone. Position 4 is para to the ketone, which is deactivating (since ketone is meta director, para is not a main site, but perhaps some activation).

Hmm, but perhaps bromine would enter at position 5 because it's meta to the ketone, which is a strong director. So, after nitration at 3, bromination would occur at 5? But wait, in the target, bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. Oh wait, no, the target has bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So in this scenario, I have nitro at 3 and I'm adding bromine at 5, which would make the substituents at 3 (nitro) and 5 (Br), but wait, the target requires nitro at 5 and Br at 3. So this approach may not get me the desired positions.

So perhaps the order is reversed. Maybe I should introduce bromine first, then nitro, but wait, with benzene. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I need to perform some kind of substitution after introducing the ketone. Wait, but substitution on the benzene ring would require activating groups.

Alternatively, maybe I should first nitrate, but earlier I thought that nitro is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult. But maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then add the ketone. But wait, nitro is meta director. Let's think: benzene is nitrated → nitro at position 1. Then, can I introduce the ketone via Friedel-Crafts? No, because nitro is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So that's not possible. So must add ketone before nitro.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first add the ketone (position 1), then nitro (position 3), then bromine.

Wait, but earlier I thought that after adding nitro at 3, bromine would go to 5. But target has bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So that would not match.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each option has a series of steps. Let's see.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3; ii) Br2/FeBr3; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Wait, this seems to have steps for substitution and nitration. Let's break it down.

i) Friedel-Crafts acylation: benzene → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3: bromination. So, in acetophenone, bromine would go meta to ketone → position 3.

iii) Nitration: in acetophenone with Br at 3, where does the nitro group go? The ketone is at 1, Br at 3. Nitration would be directed by the ketone (meta) and Br (ortho/para). Wait, bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So the nitration would be influenced by both groups.

Wait, acetophenone (position 1) is meta director, so directing to 3 and 5. But 3 is already brominated. So the next available meta position is 5. But wait, the Br is at 3. Since Br is ortho/para directing, nitration may occur at positions 2,4, or 6.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think about the substituents and their directing effects.

In any case, perhaps the correct sequence is: add the ketone first, then the nitro group, then the bromine.

Wait, but looking at option B:

B) i) Br2/FeBr3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) Fe/HCl; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

So first, benzene is brominated. That would give bromobenzene. Then nitrated: nitro group would go meta to Br. Then, acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating rings, but nitro is deactivating. So after nitrating bromobenzene, the ring is not activated enough for Friedel-Crafts. So this sequence probably doesn't work.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3; iv) Br2/FeBr3; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

First, nitrating benzene. Then Fe/HCl: that's probably reduction, maybe to convert nitro to amine. Then acylation. Then bromination. Then nitration again? That seems a bit convoluted.

Wait, let me think. Step i: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene. Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So, aniline. Step iii: acylation → acetanilide. Step iv: bromination. Bromine would enter para to the amine (since aniline's NH2 is ortho/para directing). Then, step v: nitration again. So, adding another nitro group.

But the target only has one nitro group. So that seems off.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) NaNO2/HCl; iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3; vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

So, starting with nitration: nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl: reduce nitro to amine → aniline. Then NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. Then H3PO2: probably hydrolysis, but wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, used for something else.

Wait, I'm not quite sure about this sequence. Let's think: after diazotization, H3PO2 would be used in a Sandmeyer reaction, perhaps for substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, in the target molecule, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Nitrate → nitro at meta to ketone.

3. Brominate → bromo at another position.

But earlier confusion arises about bromine's position.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has substituents at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So, perhaps it's better to first introduce the nitro group and then the bromine, but earlier that's not possible because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine.

But if I first brominate benzene, then add the ketone, then nitrate. Let's see:

1. Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

2. Bromobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts. But wait, bromobenzene is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So this is not possible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts).

2. Introduce the bromine (bromination) → meta to ketone.

3. Then nitrate → where would the nitro group go? Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Nitration would be directed by both groups.

Wait, ketone is meta director, Br is ortho/para. So, the possible positions for nitration would be positions influenced by both.

Wait, for the ketone, nitration would go to 3 and 5, but 3 is already brominated. So, position 5 would be a possible site. For Br, which is at 3, it's ortho (2 and 4) and para (6) positions. So, the available positions for nitration would be 2,4,5,6.

But which is more favored? Nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps the most activated position is 5 (directed by ketone) or 2 or 4 (directed by Br).

Wait, the nitration is an electrophilic substitution. The ketone group is a meta director, so it would direct to position 5. The Br is ortho/para, so it directs to positions 2,4,6.

So, the nitro group would enter where the majority of the directing effects point. So, if both substituents are present, the more activating group's direction might dominate.

Wait, but the ketone is deactivating, and Br is deactivating as well. So, their directing effects may influence the nitration.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5, which is the only available meta position to the ketone. Then, the bromine is at position 3.

But in the target, the bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. So, in this case, the nitro would be at 5, and the bromine at 3. Thus, the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. That matches the target.

So, then the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation → ketone at 1.

2. Bromination → bromine at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone, since Br is at 3 and may not interfere).

Wait, but after bromination, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br). Then, during nitration, which substituent directs more?

The ketone is a meta director, so nitro would go to 5. The Br is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2,4,6. So, if the nitration occurs, it could go either way, but the position most activated by the substituents would be chosen.

But since the ketone is a stronger director (maybe) than Br, the nitro might go to position 5.

So, the sequence would be: Ketone → Br → Nitro.

Looking back at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ketone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro at 5.

iv) Fe/HCl → not sure what this is. Wait, Fe/HCl is likely catalytic in some reaction, perhaps a reduction. But after nitro, why would you reduce?

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, after the ketone, Br, and nitro are added, are there any more steps? The options have more steps, but perhaps some steps are for protecting groups or other functional group interconversions.

Wait, perhaps the question is about introducing groups in a way that allows for high-yield synthesis, which may involve activating and deactivating steps. Alternatively, some steps might involve forming a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which leads to the correct substituents.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added. Where? Bromine is ortho/para director. So nitro would go to ortho (2), para (4), or meta (to benzene's starting point, but since benzene is symmetric, let's say position 2 or 4). Let's say position 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts. But the ring is now nitrated and brominated. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this sequence is unlikely to work.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine: aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts. But aniline is strongly activating, so acylation would occur. Where? Aniline's NH2 is ortho/para director. So, the ketone would be added at ortho or para to NH2. Let's say para. Then, the ring has NH2 at 1 and ketone at 4.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at meta to ketone (position 6 or 2) or para to NH2. But this is getting complicated.

Hmm, perhaps not the correct path.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces to aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis? Or maybe a substitution.

Wait, H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts to form phenols. So, if we have aniline, diazotize it, then treat with H3PO2, we'd get a phenol. But then, step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of phenol. But phenol is strongly activating, so bromine would add ortho or para.

Then step vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But phenol is strongly activating, so it would direct the acylation to ortho or para. Then step vii: nitration again. Not sure if this would lead to the target.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about each step in each option and see which sequence logically leads to the correct substituents.

The target has:

- Ketone (from acylation) at position 1.

- Bromine at position 3 (meta to ketone).

- Nitro group at position 5 (meta to ketone, and perhaps also meta to bromine? Or not, because bromine is at 3, and nitro is at 5, which is next to it.)

Wait, the positions are 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So, the ring is symmetric with substituents across.

So, the synthesis steps must introduce these groups in an order that allows each substitution to occur in the correct position based on directing effects.

So, the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone (position 1) via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce bromine (position 3) via bromination, which is meta to the ketone.

3. Introduce nitro group (position 5) via nitration, which is meta to the ketone.

Wait, but after adding bromine, will the nitration go to position 5?

In option A, the steps after ketone and bromine are nitration. So, let's see:

Option A: steps i to iii.

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Br added to position 3.

iii) Nitration: would the nitro go to position 5, which is meta to ketone (1) and para to Br (3). Wait, the Br is at 3, which is meta to 6. So, when nitration occurs, the ketone directs to 5, and Br (ortho/para) directs to 2,4,6. So, position 5 is only directed by the ketone, and 2,4,6 by Br. But nitration is a strong electrophile; which position would be more reactive?

The ketone is deactivating, but the Br is also deactivating. So, perhaps the position that is most activated by any substituent is position 5 because it's the only position meta to the ketone. So, nitration would occur at 5.

So, after these steps, the substituents would be 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), which is the target.

Then, what are the steps beyond that?

Looking at option A, after nitration (step iii), the steps iv to vii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce something.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → hydrolysis.

Wait, why would you nitrate again after step iii? That doesn't make sense for the target molecule, which has only one nitro group.

So, perhaps option A's steps are incorrect beyond the first three. So, maybe the correct answer isn't option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, it has the ketone, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

Looking at the reaction steps, perhaps some steps are for introducing groups in a way that allows for the correct substitution.

Wait, perhaps some steps involve using a directing group. For instance, sometimes you need to protect a group or use a directing group to add substituents in a certain order.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

But then, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts acylation won't work. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine, but then the directing effects may not align.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt. For example, after introducing the nitro group, then bromine can be added.

Wait, but again, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the directing effects again.

If the ketone is at 1, and the nitro is at 5 (meta), then bromine would go to 3 (meta to the ketone or para to the nitro? Wait, nitro is at 5; the meta positions are 2 and 8 (but benzene is a six-membered ring, so 2 and 8 would be 2 and 6). So the bromine could go to position 3, which is meta to ketone (1) and para to nitro (5)?

Wait, position 3 is meta to position 1 (ketone), and position 5's meta positions are 2 and 8 (but on benzene, 8 is 2). So, position 3 is ortho to position 2 and para to position 6.

Hmm, perhaps the bromine goes to position 3, which is meta to the ketone (1) and para to the nitro (5). But how does that work in terms of directing effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, but earlier I saw that it's not possible because the ring becomes deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a directing group. For example, using a methyl group that's later removed.

Wait, maybe I should think of a two-step substitution approach, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option B: steps i) Br, ii) nitrate, iii) acylate.

But after nitrating bromobenzene, the ring is deactivating, so acylation (Friedel-Crafts) won't proceed. So option B is invalid.

Option C: nitrates first → deactivates ring → can't acylate. So invalid.

Option D: nitrates first → reduces → gets aniline → acylation. Let's see:

i) Nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduced to NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotize → N2+Cl- at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis to phenol (OH at 1).

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromine would go para to OH (position 4) or ortho (2 or 6). Let's say position 4.

vi) Acylation → ketone at position 2 or 6 (ortho to OH) or para (4, but Br is there). So, acetophenone at 2.

vii) Nitration → where? The ring has OH at 1, Br at 4, ketone at 2.

OH is strongly activating, directs to ortho and para. So nitration would go para to OH (position 4) but that's occupied by Br. Ortho would be positions 2 and 6. Position 2 is already ketone, so nitration would go to 6.

But the target has nitro at 5, so perhaps this approach isn't correct.

So, perhaps the correct option is A, but with some steps beyond the first three.

Wait, looking back at option A:

Steps i to iii would give the correct substituents (ketone, Br, nitro). But then steps iv to vii: iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reducing something, but what? Then v) nitrate again, which we don't need. So maybe option A's steps after iii are not needed, but the question is which option gives the correct sequence leading to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps beyond iii are not relevant, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps. Let's think again about the options.

Another possibility: after ketone, bromine, and nitro are introduced, perhaps some reduction steps are needed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps option D steps are:

i) Nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotize → N2+ at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → phenol (OH at 1).

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromine at para (4) or ortho (2 or 6) to OH.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation, which would be ortho or para to OH. So, if Br is at 4, acylation would be at 2 or 6.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Where? The ring has OH at 1, Br at 4, and ketone at 2 or 6.

Nitration would be directed by the most activating group. OH is strongly activating, so nitration would go to ortho (2 or 6, but ketone is there) or para (4, which is Br). Hmm, not matching the target.

So, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier analysis.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups. The sequence must allow for each to be added in the correct order based on directing effects.

So, the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone (Friedel-Crafts acylation).

2. Introduce bromine (bromination, meta to ketone).

3. Introduce nitro group (nitration, meta to ketone, which is at position 5).

So, the steps would be: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration.

Looking at the options, which option has these steps in this order?

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. Then steps iv to vii. So, the first three steps are correct.

But why are there more steps? Maybe some steps are for protecting groups or other purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps are for substituting functional groups. For example, perhaps after nitration, you need to perform some reaction to get the correct substituent.

Wait, after steps i, ii, iii in option A, you have the correct substituents. The rest of the steps might be for other purposes, perhaps removing certain groups.

Wait, but the target doesn't have any functional groups beyond the ketone, Br, and nitro. So, perhaps the steps beyond iii are not necessary. But in the options, the sequences are given, and the correct one should have the necessary steps leading to the target.

Wait, but the options have seven steps each. So, perhaps the correct sequence includes other steps, such as introducing a leaving group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as a benzidine rearrangement, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt.

But, perhaps, to save time, the correct answer is option A, but I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B, but I thought that Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after nitration.

Wait, another angle: the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

So, the correct order of substitution is ketone → nitro → bromine.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but that may not be possible due to deactivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different directing group, such as a methyl group which is then removed.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves the following steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts → acetophenone with nitro.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would not proceed. So, this approach is not possible.

Hmm, this is quite challenging.

After considering all possibilities, I think the correct sequence is option A. Because the first three steps introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions. The additional steps in option A might not be necessary but are part of the given options.

Wait, but the target doesn't require any further steps after the first three, so perhaps the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone), and a nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone). The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully considered to achieve the desired positions.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone at position 1 on the benzene ring.
2. **ii) Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination occurs at position 3, which is meta to the ketone.
3. **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the ketone.
4. **iv) Fe/HCl**: Likely a reduction step, but not necessary for the target molecule.
5. **v) HNO3/H2SO4**: Unnecessary nitration step, as the target already has one nitro group.
6. **vi) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, not required in this synthesis.
7. **vii) H3PO2**: Hydrolysis, not relevant to the target molecule.

The first three steps correctly introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the desired positions. The additional steps are unnecessary but do not interfere with the synthesis.

#### **Option B**:
1. **i) Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination of benzene introduces bromine at position 1.
2. **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 3 (ortho/para to bromine).
3. **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone. However, the ring is deactivated by the nitro group, making this step unlikely to proceed.
4. **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, not required for the target molecule.
5. **v) Fe/HCl**: Likely a reduction step, but not necessary.
6. **vi) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, not relevant to the target molecule.
7. **vii) H3PO2**: Hydrolysis, not relevant to the target molecule.

This sequence is not feasible because the nitro group deactivates the ring, preventing Friedel-Crafts acylation.

#### **Option C**:
1. **i) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine (aniline).
3. **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone. However, the ring is still deactivated by the amine group, making this step unlikely to proceed.
4. **iv) Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination introduces bromine. However, the directing effects of the substituents do not align with the target molecule.
5. **v) HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, not required for the target molecule.
6. **vi) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization, not relevant to the target molecule.
7. **vii) H3PO2**: Hydrolysis, not relevant to the target molecule.

This sequence is not feasible because the nitro group and amine group interfere with the synthesis.

#### **Option D**:
1. **i) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction converts the nitro group to an amine (aniline).
3. **iii) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium salt.
4. **iv) H3PO2**: Hydrolysis converts the diazonium salt to a phenol.
5. **v) Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination introduces bromine. However, the phenol group strongly activates the ring, leading to bromination at positions 2 or 4, which does not match the target molecule.
6. **vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone. However, the directing effects of the substituents do not align with the target molecule.
7. **vii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Additional nitration, not required for the target molecule.

This sequence does not produce the correct substituents in the desired positions.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only sequence that correctly introduces the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the desired positions. The first three steps achieve the target molecule, and the additional steps do not interfere with the synthesis.
