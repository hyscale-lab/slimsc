Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Alright, let me read it again.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, which travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls?

Hmm. So initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third reach the walls. We need to find a new Lorentz factor that results in two-thirds reaching the walls.

Wait, let me think about what factors determine whether a particle reaches the detector's wall. I remember that in particle physics, the distance a particle travels before decaying is a key factor. The formula I recall is that the mean decay length is given by c multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. So, the decay length L is approximately c * tau * gamma.

So, for a particle to reach the detector's wall, the decay length L must be equal to or greater than the radius R of the detector. So L >= R.

In the first scenario, when gamma is 20, only one third of the particles reach the wall. That implies that the decay length is just about enough for some fraction to make it. Maybe it's something to do with the probability that the particle decays beyond a certain point.

Wait, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is given by the exponential decay formula: P(t) = exp(-t/(tau)). But when you consider the distance, since t = L/(c gamma), because L = gamma c tau, wait maybe I should think about the proper time.

Wait, proper time is tau. The time measured in the lab frame is t = gamma tau. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The particle's lifetime in its rest frame is tau. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. The distance it travels is L = v * t ≈ c * t because it's ultra-relativistic, so v ≈ c.

So L ≈ c * gamma tau.

We want the particles to reach the detector's wall, which is at radius R. So L needs to be at least R. But wait, considering that some particles decay before reaching R, the fraction that reaches is the probability that the decay happens after traveling R.

Wait, no. The fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling a distance R. Because when the particle decays, it stops moving, right? So the probability P that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is given by the exponential function.

So P = exp( - R/(c tau gamma) )

Because the decay length per unit gamma is c tau. So the argument is R/(c tau gamma). So when gamma is higher, the exponent becomes smaller, making exp(-x) larger. So higher gamma means higher probability of reaching the wall.

In the initial case, gamma is 20
