Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack what it's asking. So the question is about a decay process X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right. So I think this has something to do with relativistic particles and their lifetimes. Oh right, because particles moving at high speeds will have their lifetimes appear longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime observed (τ) is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, how does that relate to the resolution? Oh, the resolution in the context of particle detectors usually refers to the smallest distance they can measure. So if the particles decay over a longer path, the detector needs to be able to distinguish that. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum distance the decay products need to travel so that the decay can be observed.

Hmm. So perhaps I need to calculate the average path length the X⁰ travels before decaying. Because particles with a longer lifetime (due to gamma) will travel a longer distance, and the detector's resolution has to be good enough to see that decay.

Wait, the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So when the particle is moving at a high speed, its lifetime as observed is longer. The distance it travels before decaying is then velocity multiplied by the observed lifetime. But since the proper lifetime is given, I can calculate the average path length.

But wait, the problem says what's the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh right, so 30% of the decays would mean that the detector can capture the decay points in at least 30% of the cases. So I think the average path length multiplied by some factor might be involved.

Let me think about the formula. The number of decays observed depends on the probability that the particle decays within a certain length that the detector can resolve. The average path length L is given by gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Because L is the product of the particle's velocity (beta c) multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame (gamma tau_0).

But wait, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So, the distance it travels on average is beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, but I need to find the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. Oh, so the number of decays observed (N) is related to the probability that the decay occurs within the detector's resolution. I think the formula for the number of decays detected is N = (1 - e^{-t/T}), where t is the observation time? Or maybe it's more about the decay length.

Alternatively, the probability P that a particle decays within a certain length x is P = 1 - e^{-x / (beta
