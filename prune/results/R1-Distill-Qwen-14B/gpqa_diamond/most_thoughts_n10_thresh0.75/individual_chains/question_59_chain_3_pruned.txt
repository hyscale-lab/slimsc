Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. It involves mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. 

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should first figure out how much acid and base I have and see which one is in excess.

The problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let me write them down.

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think I should calculate the moles of each. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters), right?

Let's start with each solution.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so that's H+ ions. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M, so moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So now, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. Wait, but wait—acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But when mixed with a strong base, I think the strong base will react first, neutralizing the H+ ions, and then any excess will react with the weak acid.

Wait, but the problem is mixing all three solutions. So first, I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total H+ and OH- in the mixture.

Wait no, I think I should think of all the H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) and all the OH- (from Ba(OH)2) and see which is in excess.

But wait, the HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl-. The Ba(OH)2 will fully dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

The acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. But in a solution, its dissociation might be affected by the strong acid and base. Hmm, but when I mix all three, perhaps I should first calculate the net H+ or OH-.

Wait, let's approach this step by step.

First, calculate all the H+ sources and OH- sources.

H+ comes from HCl and any excess from acetic acid not neutralized.

OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, when you mix an acid with a base, they will neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. Plus any H+ from acetic acid, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute much before neutralization. Wait, but when you have a strong acid and a weak acid, the strong acid will fully donate H+, so the H+ is 0.08 + (some from acetic acid). But wait, the OH- is 0.18 moles. So the OH- will react with H+ from
