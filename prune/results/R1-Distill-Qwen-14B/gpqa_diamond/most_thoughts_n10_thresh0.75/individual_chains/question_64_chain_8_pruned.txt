Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a go.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through some tubes. Let me break down the setup:

The gases went through three tubes in order. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 has red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gained 3.60 g, tube 3 gained 0.80 g, and tube 2 didn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

First, I need to figure out what each tube does. 

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but more importantly, it reacts with water vapor. Mg(ClO4)2 is deliquescent and will absorb water. So any H2O in the gas would be absorbed here, increasing the tube's weight. So the 3.60 g increase is due to water.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 or another acidic gas were present, it would react. But the problem says the weight didn't change, so maybe no CO2 or other acidic gases were present. Wait, but if there was CO2, the solution would increase in mass. Since it didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2, or other gases like NH3, but wait, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2 but wouldn't increase the mass much because it's a solution. Hmm, maybe no acidic gases passed through here.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. So, if the gas is CO, it would react with Cu. Let me think: CO is a reducing agent. When CO reacts with Cu, it forms CuO. The mass increase is 0.80 g. So the CO must have been the gas that reacted here. 

Wait, but what about other gases? Could there be H2 or something else? I think CO would be a likely candidate since it's a common product in such reactions, especially when heating salts.

So what's the breakdown of gases? The initial mixture after heating gives off gases. Let me think about possible products. Since the salts are heated without air, perhaps it's a decomposition reaction. For example, maybe the salts decompose into gases like H2O (steam), CO, and maybe some inert gases? Or perhaps something else.

Wait, from tube 1, we have 3.60 g of H2O. Let me calculate how much that is. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60 g is 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol of H2O. 

Then, in tube 3, 0.80 g of CuO was formed. The molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is ~63.55, O is 16, so 63.55+16=79.55, approx 80 g/mol). So 0.80 g is 0.01 mol. 

Wait, but wait: when CO reacts with Cu, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for every mole of CuO formed, two moles of CO react. So 0.01 mol of CuO would mean 0.02 mol of CO reacted. 

So, what's the total gas that went through? Let me summarize:

- H2O: 0.2 mol
- CO: 0.02 mol (since 0.01 mol CuO came from 0.02 mol CO)
- And some gas C remained, which is 2.24 L at STP.

At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L, so 2.24 L is 0.1 mol. So gas C is 0.1 mol. 

Now, what's gas C? It could be a noble gas, perhaps, but maybe it's CO2 or another gas. But wait, in tube 2, there was no change. So if any CO2 was present, it would have reacted with Ca(OH)2. Since tube 2 didn't change, that suggests no CO2. So gas C can't be CO2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's nitrogen (N2) or another inert gas.

But wait, maybe I should list all possible gases that could be formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial salts are producing a combination of H2O, CO, and another gas, say, N2 or
