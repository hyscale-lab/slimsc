Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

So, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital periodâ€”three times shorter than Planet_2's. Their host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the other star. The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. I need to figure out which one they should choose.

Wait, transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do I calculate the probability based on the given parameters?

I think the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_s / a) / ( (1 + R_s/a) ) ) * something else? Or wait, maybe it's more about the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. Oh, right! The transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, I recall that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by something else, maybe the planet's orbital inclination. But since we don't know the inclination, perhaps the probability is more of a geometric probability. Oh right! The geometric probability, which is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view.

The formula for geometric probability is P = (R*/a) / (1 + R*/(2a)), no wait, maybe it's (R*/a) times some factor. Alternatively, another source says the probability is R*/(a), but that can't be right because if a is much larger than R*, it would be very small, which makes sense. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R*/a) / (1 + (R*/a)) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh, wait, I think the probability is actually given by P = (R* + Rp)/(a) * something,
