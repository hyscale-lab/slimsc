Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its active form, deprotonated enough to bind strongly. The temperature is 25°C, but I'm not sure how that affects this particular calculation.

The K value given is 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf for the Ca-EDTA complex. So the formula would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

But wait, maybe I should consider the dissociation of the complex. The Kf is very large, which suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. Oh wait, no, Kf is the formation constant. A large Kf (like 5e10)
