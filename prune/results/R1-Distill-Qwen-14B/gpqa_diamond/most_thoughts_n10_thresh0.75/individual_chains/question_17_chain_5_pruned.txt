Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. So when it forms a complex with a metal ion like Ca²+, the solution's free metal ion concentration is really low because most of the metal is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the question gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So I think this is the concentration of the complex, which is the [CaEDTA²−] in solution.

I need to find [Ca²+], the free calcium ion concentration. Since the complex is formed, the [Ca²+] would be related to the formation constant.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴− ↔ CaEDTA²−.

The expression for K would be K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]).

But wait, in solution, not all EDTA is in the Y^4− form. EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which I think means that EDTA is mostly in the Y^4− form. So I can assume that [EDTA⁴−] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, which is the same as the concentration of the complex because each complex releases one EDTA and one Ca²+.

Wait, no. Let me think. The total concentration of EDTA would include the free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex. But if K is very large, the complex is formed almost completely. So [EDTA⁴−] is much less than the concentration of the complex? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, when K is very large, the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So [CaEDTA²−] is much larger than the product of [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−
