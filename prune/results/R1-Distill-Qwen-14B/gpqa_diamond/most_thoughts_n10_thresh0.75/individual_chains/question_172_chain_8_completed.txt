Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, so in LTE, the distribution of atoms in energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution, right? The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). 

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote E_upper as E_i and E_lower as E_j. So, the ratio for star_1 is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) ).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. I think that means the population of the higher energy level is twice as much as in star_2. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Let me write that down: (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
n2_upper/n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So substituting into the first equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. Let's do that.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

The ln of exp(x) is x, so that becomes:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation. Let me bring the ΔE terms to one side.

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But wait, 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me see:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, because (T1 - T2) is numerator, and denominator is T1*T2.

So substituting back in:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the units. I know that k (Boltzmann constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE is exactly equal to k times something? Let me compute.

Wait, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = k * 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1.

So substituting ΔE = k * 1 into the equation:

(k * 1)/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Simplify: (1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). Let me see the options:

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the population of atoms in energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the populations are related as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k_B T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

The term \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), so:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k_B} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = k_B \cdot 1 \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation provided in **Option D**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
