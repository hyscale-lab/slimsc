Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I remember that in LTE, the properties can be treated using the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of different energy states in a system. The formula I think is something like the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Oh right, the formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), where E_i and E_j are the energies of the states.

In this case, the excited level would have higher energy. Let's say E is the higher energy level and E' is the lower one. So for each star, the ratio of excited to lower state would be n_E / n_E' = exp( (E' - E)/(k T) )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if E is the higher energy, then E - E' is positive. So the formula should be n_E / n_E' = exp( -(E - E')/(k T) ), because E is higher than E', so E' is lower.

Wait, correction: The formula is (n_j)/(n_i) = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So if E_j is the higher state (excited) and E_i is the lower (ground), then E_j - E_i is positive. So (n_j)/(n_i) = exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) ). So for each star, the ratio is determined by their temperature.

But in the question, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So let me think: n1_E / n1_E' = 2*(n2_E / n2_E') ? No, wait. Wait, the question says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Hmm, maybe I should model this.

Let me denote for each star:

n1 = number of excited atoms in star_1
n2 = number in star_2

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the population ratio is n1 / n_ground1 = 2*(n2 / n_ground2 ). Wait, not exactly. Wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the ratio of the number of excited atoms to the lower state is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2.

So for star_1, (n_E1 / n_E'1) = 2 * (n_E2 / n_E'2 )

Because the excited level in star_1 is twice as populated compared to star_2.

So each ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor for each star. So:

n_E1 / n_E'1 = exp( -(E - E')/(k T1) )

Similarly,

n_E2 / n_E'2 = exp( -(E - E')/(k T2) )

So (n_E1/n_E'1)/(n_E2/n_E'2) ) = [ exp( -(E - E')/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -(E - E')/(k T2) ) ]

Which is equal to exp( [ (E - E')/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because:

a/b = exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( [ (E-E')/(k) ] (1/T2 -1/T1) )

Wait, no. Let me compute the exponent:

If a = -(E-E')/(k T1) and b= -(E-E')/(k T2), then a - b is:

[ -(E-E')/(k T1) ) + (E - E')/(k T2) ) ]

Factor out (E - E')/k:

= (E - E')/k [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] 

= (E - E')/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the exponent is [ (E - E') (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

But wait, the ratio is (n_E1/n_E'1)/(n_E2/n_E'2 )= 2, because n_E1/n_E'1 is twice that of star_2.

So 2 = exp( [ (E - E') (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 ) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = [ (E - E') (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the temperatures. Let's note that E - E' is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, what is the value of k (Boltzmann constant)? It's approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So E - E' = k * (something). Wait, let me see: E - E' = 1.38e-23 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so E-E' is exactly k * 1 K. Because 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K.

So substituting E - E' = k * Delta, where Delta is 1 K? Wait no, wait: E - E' = 1.38e-23 J. So E - E' = k * T, where T is 1 K. Because k * T = (1.38e-23 J/K) * T. So if T=1 K, then k*T=1.38e-23 J, which matches E-E'.

So in the equation:

ln(2) = [ (k * T) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

The k's cancel out:

ln(2) = [ T (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But T is 1 K, so it simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

Wait, let me double-check the steps. So the ratio is 2, so ln(2) equals the exponent, which after substitution becomes (T1-T2)/(T1 T2). Yep, that's option D.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the ratio of excited to lower energy states of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \) when \( T = 1 \, \text{K} \).

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_E}{n_{E'}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{E1}}{n_{E'1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{E2}}{n_{E'2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2:

\[
\frac{n_{E1}/n_{E'1}}{n_{E2}/n_{E'2}} = 2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann factors:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (because \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship.

Answer: D
