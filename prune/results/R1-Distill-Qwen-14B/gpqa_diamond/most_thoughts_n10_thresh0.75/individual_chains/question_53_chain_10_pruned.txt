Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have characteristic absorption bands. The 1H NMR has six signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for –CH3 groups. There are no –CH2 signals.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. The ester group is present, so maybe one substituent is an ester. But wait, ester is R-O-CO-O-R, or wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So in this case, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like an aryl ester or maybe an alkyl ester attached to the ring.

Looking at the NMR signals. Let's break it down:

1. Aromatic-H: two signals. So, the ring has two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents would cause the ring protons to split into two groups. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring might have two equivalent H's in the ortho positions and two equivalent in the meta, but wait, no, para substitution usually gives two sets: the para position has nothing, but the ortho and meta would have equivalent Hs. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions 1 and 2, then the ring's protons might be in different environments. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two types of aromatic protons.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are two. So maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other, the ring protons would have different environments. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that create two different types of aromatic Hs.

But let's think about the di-substituted benzene. The two substituents could be in positions that lead to two different types of Hs. For example, if one substituent is in position 1 and the other in position 3,
