Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated. Let me sketch it out maybe. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to count the number of each type of bond and apply the bond energies. Oh right, because the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method.

So, the formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products) 

Wait, no, wait. I think I have that backwards. Let me think. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from its elements. So, the formula might involve the sum of the bond energies in the compound minus the sum of the bond energies in the elements (like O2, N2, etc.), but for carbon and hydrogen, which are in their elemental states as atoms.

Wait, but the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its atoms. So, for carbon, breaking a C-C bond in graphite or some standard state into carbon atoms would require 1000 kJ/mol. But I'm not sure how that factors in.

Wait, let me get this straight. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a compound can be calculated by the equation:

ΔHf = [Σ (Bond energies of all bonds in the compound)] - [Σ (Bond energies of all bonds in the elements)]

Wait no, that's not exactly correct. Because for formation, you're forming bonds in the compound from the elements, so perhaps it's the other way around. Or maybe I should think in terms of bond dissociation energies. Oh, wait, bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond. So, when forming bonds, you release energy equal to the bond energies.

Wait, perhaps the correct
