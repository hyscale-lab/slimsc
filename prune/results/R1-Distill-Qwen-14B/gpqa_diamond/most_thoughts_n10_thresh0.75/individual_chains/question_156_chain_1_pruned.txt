Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

So, the problem is about a chemist performing two reactions with different enantiomers of oct-4-ene and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA typically forms an epoxide. 

The first reaction is with (E)-oct-4-ene. E geometry means the higher priority groups are opposite each other. Treating it with mCPBA, which is a peracid, should form an epoxide. Wait, but I think mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide, right? So (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms connect the two carbons that were formerly double-bonded. 

Then, after the epoxidation, there's treatment with aqueous acid. Oh, right, acid work-up of epoxides typically leads to ring-opening. The epoxide ring opens under acidic conditions. How does that happen? The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack. 

In the case of an epoxide derived from an alkene, like oct-4-ene, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to the formation of a diol. The epoxide would have the oxygen between the two adjacent carbons, and when it opens, each oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group. 

Wait, but the configuration of the starting alkene affects the product. Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, which is trans, when it forms an epoxide, the groups on either end of the epoxide (the two new oxygen bridges) are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide opens under acidic conditions, the diol formed would have the hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, but their configuration (cis or trans) would depend on the starting geometry.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me get this straight. The epoxidation of a trans (E) alkene would form a trans epoxide. Because in the epoxide formation, the two new bonds (from the peracid) are formed with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So if the alkene was trans, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen groups on opposite sidesâ€”so the epoxide is also trans.

Then, under acidic conditions, the epoxide ring opens. The ring opening of a trans epoxide would lead to a diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on the same side. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When the epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon? Or the less substituted? I think it's the more substituted because it's more stabilized. 

Wait, no, epoxide ring opening under acid conditions typically involves the acid protonating the epoxide oxygen, which makes the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted would have more steric hindrance, but wait, maybe it's more about the stability of the transition state. Alternatively, the attack can be on either carbon depending on the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the possibility of carbocation formation, but with epoxides under acidic conditions, usually, it's a two-step process. 

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific case. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Let me correct that. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on either side. So it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, let me draw it. 

Wait, no. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's not possible because that would be 4-pentene or something. Wait, octane has eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps a better way to write it is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, no, sorry, I'm getting confused. Let me think: Octane is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. So, oct-4-ene would have the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2
