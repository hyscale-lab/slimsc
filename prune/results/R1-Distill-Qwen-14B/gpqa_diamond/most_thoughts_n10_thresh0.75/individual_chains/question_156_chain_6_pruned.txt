Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and think through it step by step. 

So, the question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. We need to determine how many peaks each will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) is a peracid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide. But wait, do I remember correctly? Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide, which is a cyclic ether.

But wait, the reaction conditions here are important. The problem states that each reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right! The acid work-up. Epoxides under acidic conditions can undergo ring-opening reactions. So, the epoxide might undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction.

Wait, what's the structure of oct-4-ene? For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on either end are opposite each other. Similarly, (Z) would have the same substituents but on the same side. 

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the starting alkene (E or Z) will affect the structure of the epoxide. Let me think: the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide if the starting alkene was trans, and cis if the starting alkene was cis. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, when the double bond is in a certain configuration, the epoxide will form with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, I remember that the epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is stereospecific and forms an epoxide where the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry is preserved. So, for an (E) double bond, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen-bearing groups on opposite sides. Similarly for (Z).

But wait, actually, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The reaction is a concerted process, so the stereochemistry of the double bond is retained. So, the E and Z alkenes would form trans and cis epoxides, respectively.

Let me draw this. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite. So, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms would end up on opposite sides, making a trans epoxide. Similarly, the Z isomer would form a cis epoxide.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Another approach: the epoxidation of an E-alkene would form an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face or opposite? Let me think about the mechanism. The peracid (mCPBA) adds across the double bond in a way
