Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator usually deals with simple harmonic motion, like a mass on a spring moving back and forth. But wait, this is relativistic, so we're probably dealing with high speeds where relativistic effects matter. 

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are all different formulas, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think step by step.

First, the setup: the oscillator is 1-dimensional, mass m, maximum amplitude A, and obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. So in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. That would be (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so that formula can't be correct because it doesn't account for the speed approaching the speed of light.

Right, in relativity, as an object's speed approaches c, its relativistic mass increases, which affects the equations. So I can't use the simple non-relativistic formula here. I'll have to think about relativistic energy equations.

The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in harmonic oscillators, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic is (1/2)mv². But with relativity, mass increases. So perhaps I should consider the relativistic expression for kinetic energy and the potential energy.

Wait, the total energy for the oscillator should be conserved. At maximum amplitude, the mass is at rest momentarily, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the speed is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. So maybe I can set the potential energy at maximum amplitude equal to the kinetic energy at maximum speed.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² because that's the potential at x = A. The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy. Wait, no, because the rest mass energy is mc², but in the potential case, the energy is just the potential energy. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy
