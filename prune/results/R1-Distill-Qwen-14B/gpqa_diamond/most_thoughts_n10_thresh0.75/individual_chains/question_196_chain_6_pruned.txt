Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so there must be some adjustments. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But since it's relativistic, I can't just use the classical expressions for kinetic energy and potential energy. Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the classical case, the total energy at maximum displacement is all potential, (1/2)kA². At maximum speed, the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), so all energy is kinetic. So the maximum speed v_max in classical mechanics would be sqrt(kA²/m), but that's option C, but wait, this is the relativistic case.

Wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy can't exceed the rest mass energy mc². So the total energy E_total is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. But wait, the oscillator's potential and kinetic energies must still sum to the total energy.

So the total energy E_total should be the maximum potential energy at amplitude A plus the rest energy. Wait, no, maybe in the relativistic oscillator, the total energy is given by the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy? Or is it that the potential energy is part of the total energy, which includes rest energy?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to model it.

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential and rest energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because in the classical case, E = (1/2)kA², but relativistically, you have to add the rest energy. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the potential energy is part of the total relativistic energy.

Wait, no, the potential energy is part of the system's total energy. So when the mass is at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is
