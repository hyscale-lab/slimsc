Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around pericyclic reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements. Let's see what the question says and how I can approach it.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a reaction that's a sigmatropic rearrangement. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the problem says these reactions are usually thermodynamically favored, so maybe some of them go through a different pathway or form a more stable product.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm, what's happening here? The reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Structure-wise, that's like an ethanamine where both hydrogens on the N are replaced by methoxy groups. So it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both CH3O groups are on the N. So the structure is (CH3O)2NHCH2CH3? No, wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2, but that's not possible. Oh wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would replace the two Hs on the N? So it's CH2CH2 with N connected to two OMe groups. So structure would be (CH3O)2NCH2CH3. Wait, but that's a tertiary amine with two methoxy groups and a CH2CH3 group attached to N.

But the other component is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is an alcohol with a double bond starting at carbon 3, meaning the chain is four carbons long, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, I think I'm confusing the numbering. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol. The butenol has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4â€”wait, but in four
