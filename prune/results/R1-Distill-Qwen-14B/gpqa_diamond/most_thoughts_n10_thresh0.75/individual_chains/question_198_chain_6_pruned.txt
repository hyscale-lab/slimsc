Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, I need to figure out which complex is which. I remember that in coordination chemistry, the stability constant (beta) indicates how stable a complex is. A higher beta means the complex is more stable.

The blue dithiocyanato complex... Oh right, I think it's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is blue. So that's the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+. So the question is about the percentage of that species.

Wait, but the complexes have different stability constants. So the species present will depend on their respective stability. The total cobalt concentration includes all possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions.

So let's list the possible complexes:

1. Co^2+ (uncomplexed)
2. Co(SCN)^(+) (monosubstituted)
3. Co(SCN)_2^(2+) (disubstituted, blue)
4. Co(SCN)_3^(3+) (trisubstituted)
5. Co(SCN)_4^(4+) (tetravalent?)

Wait, maybe the complexes go up to four SCN- ligands. But the stability constants given are beta1 to beta4. So each beta corresponds to the successive formation. So for each step, the beta is the formation constant from the previous complex.

Wait, no. Wait, stability constant for a complex is generally the formation constant. So for each complex, beta_n is the constant for the nth complex. So for n=1, it's Co(SCN), n=2 is Co(SCN)_2, etc.

Wait, but the way the problem is written, the stability constants are for each complex, so beta1 is for the first complex (monosubstituted), beta2 for the second (disub
