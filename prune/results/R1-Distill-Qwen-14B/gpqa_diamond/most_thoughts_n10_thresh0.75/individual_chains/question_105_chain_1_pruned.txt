Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun, with certain characteristics. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, I think. The question is about comparing this situation to a hypothetical exoplanet transiting the star and determining the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm, wait. So the star's brightness variation due to the spots is being compared to the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet blocking some light. But wait, I should get the details right.

The star has a radius R* equal to the Sun's, say R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 0.2, which I think means 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So, the temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000K, so 5000K.

But wait, how does this affect the star's brightness as observed? Since spots are darker, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front would block some light, causing a dip too.

The question is, what would be the radius of the exoplanet (Rpl) relative to the star (Rstar) so that the brightness variation (the amplitude of the light curve) is the same as in the spotted star's case.

So, the first thing to think about is calculating the brightness variation due to the spots and then compare it to the variation from the exoplanet.

Let me break it down.

Case 1: Spotted Star.

The star's brightness variation is due to the spots. When the spots are facing us (as the star rotates), the total emitted light decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less. The amount of variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, but the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, only that hemisphere is visible. Oh wait, no, wait, no, the spots are on one side, so when the star rotates into our line of sight, the spots become visible, reducing the overall brightness.

Wait, but the star is observed in integrated light. So the spots being on one hemisphere would cause the brightness variation to be periodic as the star rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, so the brightness dips.

But wait, the star is a sphere, and when you have spots on one hemisphere, the brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and how much their flux contributes.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K. The spots are 5000 K. So each spot emits less flux.

The flux from a star (or a spot) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the normal star's flux per unit area is F0 = sigma * (6000)^4.

Each spot has F_spot = sigma * (5000)^4.

The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, but the hemisphere is a spherical cap. The area of a hemisphere is 2 * pi * R^2. Wait, no, actually, the area of a sphere is 4 pi R^2, so a hemisphere is 2 pi R^2.

But the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2 pi R^2 = 0.4 pi R^2.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere that's facing us is
