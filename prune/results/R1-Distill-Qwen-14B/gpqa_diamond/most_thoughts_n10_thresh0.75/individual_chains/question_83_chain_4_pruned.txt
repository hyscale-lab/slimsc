Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.040 liters. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. And we need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized, and also at the equivalence point.

Wait, but what's the initial concentration after dilution? Let me calculate that first. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, what happens? The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the acetate ion.

The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find out how much NaOH is required for that. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L or 10 cm³. So at 25% titration, we're using a quarter of that volume, which is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, no. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So the total volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³. So 25% titration would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So when we add NaOH, the total volume increases. Hmm, but perhaps I should model the two cases separately: 25% of the way to equivalence (i.e., 2.5 cm³ added) and the full equivalence (10 cm³ added).

Let me handle the 25% titration first. At this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, the
