Okay, so I've got this question about quantum mechanics, specifically about angular momentum states. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbitals. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, since p orbitals are l=1. Right, because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, and so on.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. I think the notation is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. So l1 and l2 are 1 each, so combining them, the possible L values would be from |1-1| to 1+1, which is 0, 1, or 2. So the state here is L=2, M=-1.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z for both electrons. Each L1z and L2z can have eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ, since l=1 means m can be -1, 0, +1, but the eigenvalues are m multiplied by ħ. So m is the magnetic quantum number, and the eigenvalues are mħ.

Wait, but the problem states that we are ignoring spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital part here. So each electron has its own Lz eigenvalue.

The question asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. That means each electron's magnetic quantum number m is -1 for each.

But wait, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the M is -1. Let me think about how this state is constructed. The total M is the sum of m1 and m2. So M = m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 + m2 = -1.

We want the scenario where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because then each would have eigenvalue -ħ. So let's see: m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Then M = (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the state we have is M = -1. So that's a problem because in this
