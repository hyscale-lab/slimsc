Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So each component of σ is a Pauli matrix. And n is an arbitrary unit vector. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, so σ · n would be the dot product, meaning σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But when it comes to eigenvalues, I remember that for any Pauli matrix combination like this, the eigenvalues are ± something.

The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination like σ · n, the eigenvalues would depend on the coefficients. Let me think. Oh right, because each σ_i is traceless and Hermitian, so the combination is also Hermitian, which means it has real eigenvalues.

Wait, the trace of σ · n would be the sum of its diagonal elements. Each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the trace of the whole thing would be zero, which makes sense because the eigenvalues should add up to zero. So the eigenvalues have to be something like λ and -λ for the two possibilities.

What's the magnitude of the eigenvalues here? Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1
