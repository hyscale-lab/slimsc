Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about organic chemistry, specifically identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and predicting the product after a reaction.

First, let's understand what's given. The compound X has IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus with HI is typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, red phosphorus is used to remove water in the preparation of esters. Wait, no, wait again. Wait, when you have an ester and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, that's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of an ester via the H. I think it's more of a substitution reaction. Maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid? Or wait, perhaps it's the cleavage of ethers? Or maybe the reaction is a substitution on something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters. For example, the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid when you have an acidic workup. Alternatively, maybe it's the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Wait, no, Birch is with metals like Na or Mg in ammonia. So, back to the reaction
