Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a two-component spinor. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <A> = ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector, and A is the operator. So for S_y, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2, right? Or wait, let me think: the spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because σ matrices are the Pauli matrices, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times those.

So the σ_y matrix given is:

0  -i
i   0

And S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The spin state vector is (3i,4). Let me write that as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written as column vectors, right? So when I compute the expectation value, I need to take the conjugate transpose of ψ, multiply by S_y, then multiply by ψ.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value <S_y> is ψ† S_y ψ. So ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which would be [-3i, 4], since the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, and 4 is real so it stays 4.

So let me compute this step by step. First, compute ψ† S_y. Wait, but actually, let's break it down. S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix, so I can factor that out.

So, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * ψ† σ_y ψ.

So let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ. 

Let me write ψ as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4].

σ_y is the matrix:
0  -i
i
