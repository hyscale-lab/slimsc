Okay, so I have this chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules having chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. When a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. The first structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can sometimes have stereoisomerism, especially if there's a substitution pattern that allows for different configurations. But wait, in biphenyls, the two rings are connected by a single bond. If the substituents are on the same or different positions on each ring, could that lead to cis or trans isomerism? Oh, right, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that their spatial arrangement around the central bond can't be rotated to match each other, they can show geometric isomerism. But geometric isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but not necessarily optical isomerism. Wait, geometric isomerism is about the arrangement of substituents in space, which can sometimes lead to optical activity if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not. Alternatively, if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomers. Let me check the structure. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on the biphenyl, and each has two nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, the structure might have substituents that make each ring have a certain arrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that are symmetric, then no chiral centers. But if the arrangement leads to a lack of internal planes of symmetry, then perhaps it's chiral. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about whether this molecule has a center of symmetry. If each substituent is on the same ring position but opposite each other, perhaps it's symmetric. Wait, the substituents are on 6,6' and 2,2', so maybe
