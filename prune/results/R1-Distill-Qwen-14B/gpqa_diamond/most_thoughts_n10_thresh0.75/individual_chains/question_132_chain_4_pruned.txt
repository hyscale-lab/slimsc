Alright, I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, and the options given are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part.

First, let's consider the aromatic region. The protons in the aromatic ring typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm. Since there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, this suggests that each compound has a set of equivalent aromatic protons, and each is a singlet. So each compound's aromatic protons are all equivalent, perhaps due to symmetry?

Wait, wait. A singlet in the aromatic region usually means that the protons don't have any neighboring protons (or their coupling partners are equivalent and averaged out—like in a para-substituted benzene with substituents that make all Hs equivalent). Alternatively, it could be a pair of equivalent protons that don't couple with any others, but that would typically be a doublet, not a singlet. So I'm thinking each compound has all equivalent aromatic protons, hence each is a singlet.

Now, for a benzene ring to have all equivalent protons, it must have a high degree of symmetry. The most common structures are those with substituents arranged in such a way that all H's are equivalent. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) would have all equivalent H's because of the three substituents at every other position. But wait, in that case, there's a central H, but no, wait no—if you have three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, then the remaining positions would be all equivalent. Wait, no: actually, in 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, the ring is symmetric, so all three H's are equivalent. So the NMR would show a singlet. But wait, wait, no. Because in mesitylene, each H is adjacent to two methyl groups. So the aromatic ring would have three H's in equivalent positions, each as a singlet. So the NMR would show a singlet.

Wait, but in our problem, each compound's aromatic region has a singlet. So each must have all H's equivalent. So each compound is such that all aromatic H's are equivalent.

Let me think about the options given. The options are:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have substituents on positions 1,2,3,4. That would leave positions 5 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let me draw a benzene ring. 1,2,3,4 are all substituents. So positions 5 and 6 are next to position 4 and 1, respectively. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the numbering is such that each position is adjacent to two others. So if 1,2,3,4 are all substituted, then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to 4 and 1. Would those H's be equivalent? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Let me imagine the structure. If the substituents are on 1,2,3,4, then substituents are on four consecutive positions. So the ring would have substituents in a 1-4 ring, leaving positions 5 and 6. Are the H's on 5 and 6 equivalent? No, because each is adjacent to substituents on 4 and 1. Wait,
