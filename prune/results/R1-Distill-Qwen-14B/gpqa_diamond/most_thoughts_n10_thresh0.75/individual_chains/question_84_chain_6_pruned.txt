Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and matrix exponentials. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the key factor when using a fractional approximation for the matrix exponential function. The options are A to D. I remember that matrix exponentials often come up in the context of solving systems of linear differential equations, like those that arise from discretizing PDEs such as the heat equation.

In sequential algorithms for solving these, you might be using methods like the time-stepping approach where each time step is computed one after another. But for parallel processing, you'd want to split the computation into parts that can be done simultaneously.

I think the key here is how the matrix exponential is approximated. If it's a higher order approximation, maybe it's using something like a Padé approximation or another method that can be split into multiple terms. Oh wait, fractional approximation methods might involve expressing the exponential as a sum of terms that can be computed in parallel.

Wait, the question mentions "fractional approximation." Fractional in what sense? Oh, perhaps it refers to methods like the exponential splitting, where the matrix exponential is split into several parts. For example, in operator splitting methods, you break the problem into different operators that can be applied in parallel.

Stability analysis (option A) is important in ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but I'm not sure if it's the key factor for making the algorithm parallel. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (B) might affect the setup but not directly the parallel conversion. 

Option C says complex roots of fractional approximation. That makes me think about the eigenvalues of the matrix. If the matrix has complex eigenvalues, its exponential would involve sinusoidal terms, which might require different handling. But how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe the roots determine the stability, but again, not directly the parallel part.

Option D is linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Wait, partial fractions are a way to decompose a rational function into simpler terms. In the context of matrix exponentials, perhaps this decomposition allows for each term to be computed independently and then combined, which could be done in parallel. Like, if the approximation is a sum of terms involving different matrices, each term could be evaluated in parallel.

Another angle: when you approximate the matrix exponential, say using a Taylor series or a Padé approximant, the approximation can sometimes be written as a sum of terms that involve powers of the matrix. If the method allows for splitting this sum into parts that can be computed concurrently, that would enable parallel processing.

But wait, how does fractional approximation tie into this? Fractional approximation methods might involve something like rational approximations where the denominator can be factored, allowing each factor to be exponentiated separately. For example, if you have an approximation like exp(A) ≈ sum(c_i exp(A_i)), then each exp(A_i) can be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, if the approximation leads to a linear combination of terms that can be split into multiple parallel tasks, that would make the algorithm parallel. So the key factor would be the structure of the fractional approximation, specifically if it can be decomposed into parts that can be handled simultaneously. 

Looking back at the options, option D is about a linear partial fraction. A partial fraction decomposition of a rational function can break it down into simpler fractions, each of which could be evaluated separately. If the approximation method allows the matrix exponential to be expressed as a sum of such simpler terms, each term could be computed in parallel, thus converting the algorithm into a parallel one.

Option C talks about complex roots. If the approximation leads to terms with complex eigenvalues, that might complicate stability but I'm not sure how it directly helps with parallelism. 

So the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one is likely the ability to split the computation into independent parts. The linear partial fraction decomposition (option D) would allow each term to be computed separately, hence enabling parallel processing.
