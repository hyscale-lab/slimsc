Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the speed of light in a glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Right, I remember that when objects move, there are effects like the Doppler effect or maybe something related to relativity. Wait, but this is a classical optics problem, I think. So maybe I don't need to worry about special relativity here.

The setup: a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Wait, but the glass is moving towards the observer, so the light is going through the glass which is moving towards the observer. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the direction.

Wait, the light is in the glass, which is moving towards the observer. Oh wait, no, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. Wait, but the glass is moving towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram in my mind.

Let's see. The lab frame is where the observer is. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So if the observer is stationary, the glass is moving towards them. But the light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. That is, the
