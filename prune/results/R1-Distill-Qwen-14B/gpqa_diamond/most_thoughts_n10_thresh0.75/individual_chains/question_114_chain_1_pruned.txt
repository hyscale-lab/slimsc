Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start with the first reaction.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, no, ketones under certain conditions can undergo addition reactions. Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon, and since it's a ketone, it's less reactive than an aldehyde, but still possible. The reaction usually involves acid catalysis to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So the first step: butan-2-one + NaCN, with acid (H3O+?) as catalyst. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense because the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and the proton is in the same position as the hydroxyl group. So, the reagent A is probably H3O+ because that's a common acid catalyst for such reactions.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So that's a molecule where the nitrile group and a hydroxyl group are both attached to the same carbon (the second carbon in butanenitrile). When this reacts with reagent B and water, it becomes a carboxylic acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? I think nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involves hydrolysis. But what are the conditions for that?

I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, using something like HCl, you might protonate and then add water. Alternatively, under basic conditions, like with aqueous KOH, followed by acid work-up. But another thought: sometimes, using a strong acid and heat can lead to the formation of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent B is used with water. Looking at the options, B is either HCl, CH3COOH, or HCl again, but in some options. So I think the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid would require H+ as a catalyst.

Wait, but the starting compound already has a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it will form a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the product
