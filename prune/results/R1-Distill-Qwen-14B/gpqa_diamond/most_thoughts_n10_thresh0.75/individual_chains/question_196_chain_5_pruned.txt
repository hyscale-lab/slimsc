Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The speed of light is c. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But this is a relativistic case, so I guess relativistic effects come into play. Oh right, in relativity, as speeds approach c, the mass increases, so the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

So perhaps I should start by considering the conservation of energy in this relativistic scenario. Let me think about the energy expressions.

In special relativity, the total energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy K is then E - m c² = (gamma - 1) m c².

In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in relativity, is the potential energy expression the same as in classical mechanics? I think so because the potential here is from Hooke's law, which is non-relativistic in origin, but maybe we're treating it as such.

So at maximum displacement (x=A), the particle has potential energy U = (1/2)k A², and kinetic energy K is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so the total energy E is equal to K + U, but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the total mechanical energy E is conserved. So E = K + U. But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, K is zero, so E = (1/2)k A².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the classical case, E is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at x=A, its
