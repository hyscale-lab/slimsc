Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question asks about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I think I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So, the lifetime tau in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

So, gamma is equal to E divided by m c², right? Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So, gamma would be E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are in GeV for energy and mass, so I guess we can work with that.

The energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So, gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 27 is slightly less than 3.41 * 8. So, maybe around 7.92? Wait, 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*(7 + 0.9) = 23.87 + 3.069 = 26.939. Close to 27. So, gamma is approximately 7.9.

So, tau (lab frame) is gamma * tau_0. So, tau = 7.9 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's compute that. 7.9*8 is 63.2, so tau is 63.2e-16 seconds, which is 6.32e-1
