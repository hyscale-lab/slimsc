Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The question gives me some details about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's see what I can figure out.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh wait, but mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context. Unless, wait, maybe it's about something else. But the question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so I think I can use the black body radiation formulas.

They also said that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T = b / λ_max is the same for both. So Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature.

Now, the formula for the luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since 4πσ is a constant, L is proportional to R² T⁴. We know T is the same for both stars, so L is proportional to R².

So for Star_1, L1 = k * R1² * T⁴
And for Star_2, L2 = k * R2² * T⁴
Since T is same, L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5 R2)² / R2² = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

Wait, but wait. The options have numbers like ~2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So 2.25 is option A. But why are other options present? Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does that affect luminosity? Oh wait, wait. Radial velocity is about the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But luminosity is an intrinsic property, so unless it's affecting the observed brightness due to Doppler shift, but the question says they computed the luminosities. So maybe that's a red herring. Because the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So maybe the radial velocities don't affect the actual luminosity, but perhaps the observed flux? Wait, but the question says to compute luminosity assuming black body radiation, so perhaps the radial velocity isn't affecting the calculation here.

Wait a second, let me think again. The
