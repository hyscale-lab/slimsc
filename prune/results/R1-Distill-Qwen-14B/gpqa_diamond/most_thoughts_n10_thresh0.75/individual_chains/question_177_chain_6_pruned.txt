Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data points are their radii, masses, the wavelengths where they appear brightest, and their radial velocities. We need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

First, let's jot down the given information:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) = 1.5 × Radius of Star_2 (R2)
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) = 1.5 × Mass of Star_2 (M2)
- The peak wavelengths for both stars are the same. Hmm, that's interesting.
- Radial velocities: Star_1's is 0 km/s, Star_2's is 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is about how fast they're moving away or towards us. But how does that affect their brightness or luminosity?

The main goal is to find L1/L2, the ratio of their luminosities.

Wait, luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since they're black bodies, that should apply here.

So L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if I can find the temperature ratio, I can find the luminosity ratio.

But wait,
