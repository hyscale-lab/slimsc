Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. Let me try to figure this out.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane ring.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. From what I recall, heating dibrominated compounds with a strong base like KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. Since both bromines are present, it might form an epoxide or perhaps open up into some kind of diol. Wait, no, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, wait, wait. Adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so I'm not sure if elimination is possible here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. So since there are two bromine atoms in 1,3 positions, elimination would form a double bond. But wait, can adamantane rings form double bonds? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton next to each Br, leading to the formation of an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides form from vicinal dihalides, but in this case, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Wait, in adamantane, 1 and 3 positions are adjacent? I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but if they're on adjacent carbons, then elimination would lead to a double bond between them. So the product would have a double bond, making it an alkene.

Wait, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where I'd expect an epoxide's protons. Epoxides typically have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but wait, 4.79 is more upfield for an epoxide? Or maybe it's an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol. Wait, the IR absorbance is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester or something with a carbonyl group.

Wait, but if we have a dehydrohalogenation
