Okay, so I'm trying to work through this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. 

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I recall that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Wait, but in this case, the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, wait. No, 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure. Or wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond lattice. So 1 and 3 might be across from each other? Or maybe not. Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the structure is such that the two bromines are on opposite ends of the adamantane, but perhaps on adjacent positions in the structure. Anyway, moving on.

So when heated with KOH, which is a strong base, it's likely an elimination reaction. Since it's dibromide, elimination would form an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so maybe the product is a ketone? Wait, that doesn't make sense because elimination usually gives alkenes. Hmm. Or perhaps the reaction is different. Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, a double elimination occurs—like two dehydrohalogenation steps. But wait, KOH in such cases typically leads to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But the IR here shows a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but something
