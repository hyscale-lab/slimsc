Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C) 6, D) 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So Grubbs catalyst, which is a transition metal carbene, facilitates this process by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's count the carbons. Pent has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me count again: pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl branch at position 3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write it out.

So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So the chain is five carbons long. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons in a row. Let me make sure:

1: CH₂= 
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH₂-
5: CH3

Wait, but that's four carbons after the double bond. No, because double bond is between 1 and 2, so the chain is 1-2 double bond, then 3,4,5. So the structure is CH₂
