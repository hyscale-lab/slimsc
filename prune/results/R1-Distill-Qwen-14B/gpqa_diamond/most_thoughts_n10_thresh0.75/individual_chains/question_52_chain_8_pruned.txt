Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that there's a star with certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The wavelength involved is 1448 Å, and LTE is assumed.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels, level 1 and level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2. The transition between these levels emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps far-ultraviolet range. So that's our λ.

But wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spot-free, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. We need to find the factor by which it changes when spot-free to spotted.

Wait, but the star's overall Teff is lower when spots are present. Wait, but when spots are present, the photosphere is cooler overall. However, the spots themselves are probably hotter than the surrounding photosphere? Or maybe not—wait, no. I think dark spots on a star are cooler regions. So when a star has spots, the average Teff is lower because a significant portion (40%) of the
