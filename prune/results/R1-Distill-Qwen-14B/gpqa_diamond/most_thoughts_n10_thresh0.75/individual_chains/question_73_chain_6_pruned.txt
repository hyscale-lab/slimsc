Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm. Let me see. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

Alright, let's break it down. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction. 

First, I think I need to find the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. 

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. 

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. But since speed is the magnitude, I think the relative speed would be 0.1c. Wait, but wait, direction matters in velocity. But I'm asked for the relative speed, which is a scalar. So the magnitude is 0.1c. But wait, the options have positive values, so maybe I should take the absolute value. So the relative speed is 0.1c. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says 0.1c, and option C says 0.14c. So wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me recall: the formula for the relative velocity u between two objects moving with velocities v and u' in some frame. No, wait, the formula is u = (v - u')/(1 - (v u')/c²). Or wait, I might have mixed up the order. Let me think again. 

So the two objects are moving in the same direction. From the perspective of the first astronaut (2m), what's the speed of the second (3m) astronaut? Or vice versa. Alternatively, the relative speed would be how much the second
