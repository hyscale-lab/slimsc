Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and determining their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds—so I definitely need to use special relativity here. I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply anymore, so using the right formulas is crucial.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Wait, but when calculating relative speeds, I can't just subtract them as I would in Newtonian mechanics. Oh right, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. The problem is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other. So, for example, what is the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B's frame. Or is it the other way around? Oh, probably whichever gives a non-negative speed, but I'll think more about that.

The first part is finding the relative speed. So let's denote astronaut 1 as 2m moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 as 3m moving at v =0.5c. Wait, but wait, in the same direction, right? Because both are moving in the positive x-direction.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, same direction. So from B's frame, what is the speed of A? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. So, in the lab frame, A is faster than B. So when I compute the relative speed, it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), but wait, u is the velocity of A, and v is the velocity of B. Because in the lab frame, B is moving at v=0.5c, and A is moving at u=0.6c. So from B's perspective, what is A's speed? So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Plugging in the numbers: u = 0.6c, v=0.5c.

So numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)*0.1c ≈ 0.0142857c, which is approximately 0.01428c. Wait, that's about 0.014c or 1.4% the speed of light. But wait, looking at the options, I see options with 0.14c and so on. Wait, did I make a mistake
