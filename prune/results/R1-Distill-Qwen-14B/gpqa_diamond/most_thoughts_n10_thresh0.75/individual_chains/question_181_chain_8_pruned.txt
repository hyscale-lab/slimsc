Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux ratios after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? I think pp-I and pp-II are lower branches, and pp-III is a higher one, maybe involving heavier elements or more energetic reactions.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops suddenly about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh, because that's the time it takes for light to travel from the sun's core to the surface. So if the core reactions stop, the photons and neutrinos would take that time to reach us. But since we're talking about neutrinos, which are produced in the core and travel almost instantly, stopping the source would mean we'd stop getting neutrinos from that process after about 8.5 minutes.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So which neutrinos are we talking about here? Solar neutrinos are mainly from the proton-proton chain, but I think the specific energies depend on the processes.

So, the pp-III branchâ€”I think it's part of the CNO cycle or maybe another part of the proton-proton chain. Or wait, maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton chain that produces higher energy neutrinos. I remember that the pp chain contributes neutrinos at specific energies. For example, the dominant neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which has an energy around 15-16 MeV, but wait, that's higher than the bands given here. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, but perhaps at lower energies than the main pp-I and pp-II. Or wait, maybe I'm confusing the branches. Let me think. The main proton-proton chain (pp-I) produces a lot of neutrinos at around 1 MeV. The pp-II branch might involve heavier isotopes and produce a little more energetic neutrinos. The pp-III branch is even higher, perhaps? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch involves triple-alpha reactions
