Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 M2.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same because lambda_max depends directly on temperature. So T1 = T2.

They also found the radial velocities of the stars. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But since luminosity is about the intrinsic brightness, maybe I don't need to consider the radial velocity's effect on the observed luminosity directly. Or wait, no. Because when we talk about luminosity, it's the intrinsic brightness — the actual energy output — so the radial velocity probably doesn't affect that. Unless it's about Doppler shifting, but the problem says they computed the luminosity based on their spectra, assuming black bodies. So maybe the velocities are a red herring, or maybe they're used for something else. I'll think about that later.

The question is about the luminosity factor: how much greater is the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are around 2.2 to 2.35, so it's about a factor of about 2.2 or so.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars are black bodies, we can use this formula for both. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2 because their peak wavelengths are the same. But wait, no. Wait, because if Star_2 is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted. Oh! Wait, the radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength.

Wait, let me think. The peak wavelength observed is the same for both stars. But the intrinsic peak wavelength depends on their actual temperatures. So maybe T_observed is different from actual T? Because the star's light is Doppler shifted due to radial velocity.

For example, if a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths are blueshifted, so the observed peak wavelength would be shorter than the actual. Conversely, if moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both stars
