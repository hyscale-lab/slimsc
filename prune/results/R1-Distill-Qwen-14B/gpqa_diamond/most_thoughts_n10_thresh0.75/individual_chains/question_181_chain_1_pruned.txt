Okay, so I've got this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino production, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (Band 1) and 800-900 keV (Band 2). So, flux Band1 over flux Band2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun produces energy. There are different branches, like the pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves maybe triple-alpha reactions or something else. Or wait, no, the triple-alpha is more for heavier elements. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain where three protons combine, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III is one of the steps where a proton captures a helium-4 nucleus, leading to beryllium and then turning into carbon.

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? I think that the pp-III is a part of the proton-proton chain, so stopping it would affect the production of certain neutrinos. Solar neutrinos are mainly produced via the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch, which produces two positrons and two neutrinos. But the pp-III branch, I'm not too sure about.

Wait, the pp-III branch might involve a different reaction. Oh, right! The pp-III branch is actually part of the main pp chain. Let me think: the main pp chain produces a helium-4 nucleus, and during this process, a neutrino is emitted when a boron-8 decays. But wait, pp-III is another step. So, maybe stopping the pp-III would reduce the production of a certain type of neutrino.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the part where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus. Oh right, so in the pp chain, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then, the deuterium captures another
