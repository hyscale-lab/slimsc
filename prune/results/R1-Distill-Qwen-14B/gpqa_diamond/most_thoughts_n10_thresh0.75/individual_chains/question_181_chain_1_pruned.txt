Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by understanding the question.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, wait. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one part of that chain, right? So if it stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the pp chain. I remember that the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (νe) from the beta decay steps. The pp-III branch—I think it's the part where triple-alpha reactions happen, but wait, no, triple-alpha is more for helium into carbon in the CNO cycle? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, the pp chain has several branches. The pp-I branch involves the initial steps of fusing protons into deuterons, and the pp-II and pp-III are other branches, possibly involving higher energy states or different pathways.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is less dominant compared to the main pp-I branch. So if the pp-III branch stops, does that mean that a certain fraction of the neutrinos from that branch are no longer being produced? But wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped, but all other reactions remained as they were. So other branches, like pp-I, are still active.
