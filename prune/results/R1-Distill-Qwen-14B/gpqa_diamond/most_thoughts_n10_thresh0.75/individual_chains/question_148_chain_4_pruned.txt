Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The problem describes several substances (A1 to A5) and their reactions. I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me break down each paragraph step by step.

First, the bright-red substance A1 decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction is probably something like A1 â†’ A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, so A1 is likely a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, but it can form compounds under certain conditions. So A1 probably has a high oxidation state of fluorine.

Wait, fluorine in high oxidation states... Fluorine usually has a -1 charge in most compounds, but in certain cases, like when it's part of a strong oxidizing agent, it can have higher positive oxidation states. Oh wait, no, fluorine is typically in a -1 oxidation state. Wait, maybe it's the other element Y that's in a high oxidation state. Because A1 is a binary compound of F and Y, so Y could be in a high oxidation state.

Wait, but if A1 is a binary compound, then it's YF_x. Since it's a bright-red substance, I'm trying to think of such compounds. One famous red fluorine compound is lead(IV) fluoride, PbF4. Lead has a +4 charge, and each F is -1. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another thought: the decomposition of A1 produces fluorine gas. So when A1 decomposes, F2 is released. That suggests that A1 contains F in a higher oxidation state, perhaps. Because when it decomposes, it might be going from a higher to lower oxidation state. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, fluorine is typically in a -1 oxidation state. So if A1 decomposes into F2, which is elemental fluorine (oxidation state 0), that suggests that in A1, F is in a lower oxidation state than 0. Wait
