Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. Hmm, wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, because the direction is in the x-z plane, the vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that, because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. But wait, the problem says it's in the x-z plane, so the angle would be in the x-z plane, so perhaps θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi is zero? Or maybe phi is arbitrary, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero. Hmm, not sure, but maybe I don't need to worry about phi because the direction is arbitrary but in x-z.

The operator vector P is given with its X, Y, Z components. Each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, for each component P_x, P_y, P_z, we have their matrix representations.

The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, first I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P in the direction n. Oh wait, wait. The operator is in the direction n, so it's P·n, right? Since the operator is a vector, the operator along n would be P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Wait, actually, if it's in the x-z plane, then n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since φ is 0 (in x-z plane), it's just sinθ.

So, the operator along n is P·n = (ħ/2) [n_x (σ_x) + n_z (σ_z)], where σ_x and σ_z are the Paul
