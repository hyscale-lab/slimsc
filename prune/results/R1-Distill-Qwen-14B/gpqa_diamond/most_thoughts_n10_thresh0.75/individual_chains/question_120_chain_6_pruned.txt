Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, and we're supposed to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A through D, each with different power laws.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax plx is the angle in arcseconds, and distance d is related by the formula d = 1/plx parsecs. Oh right, because parallax is in arcseconds, so d in parsecs is reciprocal of plx.

Now, uniform distribution in the sky. I think that means that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. But wait, when considering the distribution in terms of distance, it's not the same as uniform in space. Because if you look at stars at different distances, the number you can see changes based on how much volume you can observe.

So, let's model this. Imagine we have a sphere of radius d, and we count how many stars are within that sphere. The volume V of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars N in that volume would be proportional to V, so N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question isn't about the total number up to a distance, but the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is 1/d, so as d increases, plx decreases.

Let me think about the differential. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. Since d is
