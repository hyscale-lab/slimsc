Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second as [i, 0]. So, first things first, I should write down what S looks like.

S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[i   0 ]

Then, Ay is c multiplied by this. So c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me compute the actual matrix for Ay.

So multiplying each element by c:
Ay = [
[0 * c, (-i) * c],
[i * c, 0 * c]
]
Which is:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Wait, but maybe I should just work with S for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors since c is a scalar. Because when you have an operator multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are scaled accordingly. So perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S and then multiply by c to get Ay's eigenvalues.

Right, So let's find the eigenvalues of S. For a 2x2 matrix, the characteristic equation is det(S - λI) = 0.

So S - λ I is:
[ -λ   -i ]
[ i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = +1. So the determinant is λ² - 1 = 0.

Wait, so λ² = 1 → λ = ±1. So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1.

Since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues for Ay would be c * 1 and c * (-1). So that's (h/(4π)) * 1 and -(h/(4π)) * 1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues a would be ±h/(4π). So looking at the
