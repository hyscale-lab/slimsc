Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun each have a planet similar to Neptune. They used the RV method, which detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The key data is the periodic shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/(c * (P)^(1/3))) )^(1/3) )? Or maybe a simpler version. Oh wait, the formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3) * 2π)) )^ something. Hmm, maybe I should think of it in terms of the Doppler shift and the planet's orbital parameters.

Wait, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar-like, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies to K ≈ ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but since both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass (solar), the only variables are the periods P1 and P2. The question gives the
