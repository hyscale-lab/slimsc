Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this transit happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right?

The stars are interesting. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit odd because more massive stars are usually larger. Oh, but the Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might mean it's expanding, so perhaps it's a bit larger but in this case, their radii are the same. So same radius for both stars.

The question is about the probability of transiting. I think the transit probability depends on the orbital inclination. The probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. The formula I remember is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but wait, the exact formula might be a bit different. Oh right, the probability P is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), but maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some factor depending on the inclination. Wait, the probability is actually given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by some function based on the orbital parameters.

Wait, the transit probability formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet). But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_*/a) where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet. So higher
