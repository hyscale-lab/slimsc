Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I remember that's a method used to detect planets by measuring changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. So, that's how they found these planets.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a period longer by that ratio. So Planet_2 is 2 times Planet_1, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that won't affect the calculation. Equilibrium temperature is determined by the energy balance between incoming radiation from the star and outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_sun * sqrt(R_sun/(2a)) * (L / L_sun)^(1/4) )? No, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the formula I usually see is T = T_eff * (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). Wait, no, perhaps more directly, since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet emits as a blackbody, which depends on the fourth power of temperature.

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), assuming the planet's albedo is zero. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct formula might be T = (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4). But since L (luminosity) is a function of the star's properties, but if all the planets are around the same star, L would be the
