Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. Let me try to think this through step by step.

So, the question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then figuring out the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. I remember that these spectra can give clues about functional groups and the structure of the molecule.

First, I'll start by analyzing the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of either alcohols, amines, or maybe an alkyne. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is significant because that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. I think that could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit lower than a typical aldehyde (which is around 2800 for C-H stretch, but the C=O for aldehyde is around 1710-1740). So maybe a ketone? Or an ester?

Looking at the other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So we have some aromatic rings here. So compound X probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's list out the peaks and see what they might correspond to.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often suggests an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH is usually around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. Also, the broadness might indicate hydrogen bonding, which is more common in carboxylic acids. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This is typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para positions. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then the protons on the ring would split into two doublets. The upfield shift at 7.2 ppm might indicate that the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but a carboxylic acid is an electron-withdrawing group, so that makes sense. So maybe the benzene ring is attached to a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which could be a methylene adjacent to something, maybe a CH in a chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something that's deshielded, maybe a CH2 group or a carbonyl. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, so that's a terminal methyl group, likely at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carboxylic acid group and another substituent that's an alkyl chain. Wait, but wait, the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but more like 1710-1725. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1735-1765. Hmm. Wait, but the N
