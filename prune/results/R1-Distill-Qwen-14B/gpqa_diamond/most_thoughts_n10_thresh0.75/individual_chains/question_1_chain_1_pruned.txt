Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Or wait, maybe each state's ΔE is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, if ΔE is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then you can clearly see the difference. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, it would be hard to tell the states apart.

Wait, but let's calculate the actual values. Let's compute ħ in eV·s units. I remember that ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. To convert Joules to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.60218 × 10^-19 J. So, ħ ≈ 10^-34 / 10^-19 = 10^-15 eV·s? Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-16 eV·s. Oh right, I think I've heard that number before. Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J, so when you compute ħ in eV·s, you get around 6.58e-16 eV·s. So that's a handy value to remember for these uncertainty calculations.

So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. Let's compute ΔE for each state.

First state has τ1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Second state has τ2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) ) = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.58e-8 eV for the second state. So the first state's uncertainty is about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 10 times larger than the second state's.

Now, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps. Because if the difference is larger than the uncertainties, you can tell them apart.

Wait, but let's think: the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty of one of the states, you can't resolve them. Or wait, perhaps it's the difference compared to each state's uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. Hmm, maybe the combined uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the individual uncertainties of each state. So, for E1's ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, and E2's ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be larger than the uncertainty that arises from the measurement. But wait, how are E1 and E2 measured? Are they being measured independently, each with their own time uncertainty?

Actually, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the uncertainty in the energy difference. If the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in that difference, then you can distinguish them.

Wait, but the energy difference would have an uncertainty of (ΔE_total) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are uncorrelated. But I'm not entirely sure
