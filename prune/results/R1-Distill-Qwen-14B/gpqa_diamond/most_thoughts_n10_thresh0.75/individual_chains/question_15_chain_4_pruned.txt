Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting from our point of view. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but the question says they have the same masses. Oh, but what about their orbital periods? Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, so if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3.

Then, both have circular orbits. So that's good because eccentricity affects the chance of transit, but since both are zero, maybe the other factors are more important.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. Because if a star is more massive, it's usually larger, but here they have same radius. So perhaps Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, maybe a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit but not as much as a giant. So same radius but different masses.

We need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But since we can't change the alignment, the main factor is the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size.

Wait, but wait. The transit probability also depends on the orbital configuration—the inclination. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. The probability of that happening is given by the formula sin(i), where i is the inclination angle. But since we're using the RV method, the inclination affects the minimum mass measurement because RV only gives us the mass component along our line of sight. However, the actual mass is higher if the inclination is higher, but in this scenario, since both planets have already been detected via RV, their masses are known. Hmm, but for transit probability, the planet needs to be in an edge-on orbit, which has a probability proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, no, the transit probability is (R_planet / R_star) * (a / (a cos i)) ), but this is getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the transit probability. I think the standard formula for the probability that a planet transits is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2))^(1/2) multiplied by something else. No, wait, maybe it's more straightforward. The probability of transit is approximately (R_planet / R_star), assuming that the orbital plane is randomly oriented. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane edge-on, which has a probability of sin(i) / something, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s), where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius, but that's a simplification because it depends on the orbital distance and the star's radius. Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s) × (a / (a (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²)) ) × (some factor). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait a better approach: the probability of a planet transiting is the ratio of the size of the star plus planet to the size of the orbit, but that's not exactly right. Oh, I recall that the transit probability is the area of the star (as seen from Earth) divided by the area of the orbit in the sky, but that's not precise either.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is approximated by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a )². Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula I think is:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - e²)) ) × (some factor involving a), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about it more conceptually. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that, from our perspective, the planet passes directly in front of the star. The probability of this alignment is determined by the relative sizes of the star and the planet, and the orbital distance.

But more accurately, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital distance and the impact parameter, but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that simplifies things.

Wait, but perhaps the key formula is that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p) / a )², but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is (R_p / R_s) * ( (R_s) / a ) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should just think about the formula for the transit probability.

I recall from my studies that the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²)) ) times (something else), but with e=0, the eccentricity term drops out. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 + (R_p / R_s)) ) divided by ( 1 + (R_p / R_s) × ( (a / R_s) ) ) ), but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 × ( (R_s + R_p) / a )² × (some other factor). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s) × ( (R_s) / (a (1 - e^2))^0.5 ) ). But since e=0 for both, that simplifies to (R_p / R_s) × ( R_s / a ).

Wait, because then it would be (R_p / a), but that doesn't seem right. Because a is in the denominator, so smaller a (closer planet) would have higher probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it: the star's radius is R_s. The planet's radius is R_p. The planet's orbital distance is a. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass
