Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about two compounds A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. The products are given, and we have to choose the correct starting materials from the options.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite are involved in various reactions, like diazotization in the case of aromatic amines, but wait, that's when dealing with things like nitrous acid formation. Oh wait, but here the treatment is with HCl, NaNO2, and water. I think this might be related to the formation of carbocations or something else.

Wait, another thought—could this be the Stephen reduction? No, that's for ketones with amines. Or perhaps it's related to the formation of geminal diols, which upon oxidation form ketones. Oh! Wait, wait—no, the other way around. When you have a diol, especially a 1,2-diol (glycol), and you treat it with an oxidizing agent, you can get a diketone. But wait, this isn't an oxidizing agent; it's HCl, sodium nitrite, and water. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the formation of nitro compounds, but I don't think that leads to diketones. Let me think again. Oh, wait, there's the possibility of the formation of a carbonyl via the hydrolysis of an intermediate. Maybe the treatment is causing some kind of dehydration or rearrangement.

Wait, sodium nitrite and HCl make nitrous acid (HNO2). In what situations is nitrous acid used? Oh right, in the Hurd-Mory procedure for making ketones from alcohols, but that requires specific conditions and is more for making nitro compounds from alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's the production of a diazonium salt, but that's for aromatic rings with amine groups.

Wait, another angle: when secondary alcohols are treated with nitrous acid, perhaps under acidic conditions, they can form nitro compounds. Or maybe it's about the formation of a carbocation. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the products.

The first product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. So that
