Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond, right? Oh wait, pericyclic reactions, so they involve concerted movements of electrons, maybe like electrocyclic or cycloadditions too.

The question has three reactions, and I need to find the products A, B, C based on the given options. Let me take them one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A. Wait, but wait, the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and but-3-en-2-ol. Hmm, but in the question, it's written as 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's a molecule with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine.

I think this might involve a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. Claisen is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of allyl vinyl ethers to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyls. But wait, the starting material has an amine. Oh, wait, maybe it's an aza-Claisen rearrangement. Because aza compounds can undergo similar shifts.

So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure where the central nitrogen is connected to two methoxy groups and an ethyl chain. When it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is a secondary alcohol with a double bond, perhaps it forms some kind of ether or enol ether.

Wait, but under acidic conditions and heat, maybe the amine and the alcohol form some kind of cyclic intermediate. Alternatively, perhaps the 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine acts as an allyl amine, and the but-3-en-2-ol provides an alcohol group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is an enamine. Because enamine formation involves an amine and a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is an alcohol, not a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait,
