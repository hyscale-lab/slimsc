Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps involved. But I'll try to think it through.

The problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we also need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it will react with a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Right, because the acid provides H+ ions which will donate to the hydroxide ions in Fe(OH)3.

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each OH3 group is 16 + 3(1) = 19 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*19 = 55.85 + 57 = 112.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh yeah, 55.85 for Fe, each OH is 17 (16+1), so three OH groups would be 3 *17 =51. So total is 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. Wait, that's different. Did I make a mistake earlier? Oh yes, because the formula is Fe(OH)3, so each OH is 17, so three would be 51. So 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more precisely. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009359 mol.

Now, the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions. So the moles of H+ needed is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

So that's 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 mol H+.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity), which is 0.1 mol per liter. Since we're dealing with volume in cm³, I need to remember that 1 L = 1000 cm³.

So the volume of acid needed (V) can be found using moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So Volume = moles / Molarity.

But wait, the moles of H+ are 0.0028077. So V = 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028077 L, which is 28.077 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the question says 'minimum volume' to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. So that's the volume of acid needed.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that would be the volume. Then, what about the pH?

After dissolving, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions and excess H+ ions. Because Fe(OH)3 is a base, but the acid is strong, so all the Fe(OH)3 will react, and the solution should be acidic.

Wait, but wait. What happens after the reaction? The solution is in 100 cm³ total. So when we add the acid, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the concentration of H+ will be based on the moles of H+ used plus any from the acid, but wait, because all the Fe(OH)3 is reacting with H+.

Wait, no. The acid is a strong monobasic, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of acid gives one mole of H+.

Wait, but the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we use 3 moles of H+.

So the total H+ added is 0.0028077 mol. Let's think about the total volume. The solution's total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So the concentration of H+ is 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 L = 0.028077 M.

Wait, but wait. The acid is 0.1 M, so when we add 28.077 cm³ of it, the moles of H+ from the acid is 0.1 M * 0.028077 L = 0.0028077 mol, which matches. But is there any other source of H+? No, because Fe³+ is the conjugate acid of a weak base, but in this case, the solution is acidic, and the excess H+ comes from the strong acid.

Wait, but in reality, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+, some H+ will be consumed, but since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, perhaps the reaction goes to completion because the acid is strong. So all the H+ needed is consumed, but any excess remains.

Wait, no. In this case, the acid is in excess? Or is it exactly the required amount? Because we're talking about the minimum volume needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. That would mean adding just enough acid to react completely with Fe(OH)3. So, the H+ added is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So the H+ concentration would be 0.028077 mol in 0.1 L, which is 0.028077 M. So the pH would be the negative log of that.

Let me calculate that: pH = -log(0.028077). Let's compute that. Hmm, 0.028 is 2.8e-2. Log(2.8) is about 0.447, so log(2.8e-2) is 0.447 - 2 = -1.553. So pH is 1.553? That's around 1.55. But wait, looking at the options, the pH values are about 2-4. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it's actually a reaction that produces Fe³+ which can hydrolyze in water. Wait, right! Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can react with water to produce H+.

So the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acid produces Fe³+ ions, which can hydrolyze: Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. This will produce additional H+ ions, making the solution more acidic than just the initial H+ from the acid.

Ah, so I can't ignore that. So the initial H+ from the acid is 0.028077 mol in 0.1 L, which is 0.028077 M. But the Fe³+ will hydrolyze,
