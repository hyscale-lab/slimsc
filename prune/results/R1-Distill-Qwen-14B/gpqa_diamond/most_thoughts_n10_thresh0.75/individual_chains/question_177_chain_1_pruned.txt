Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosities. Oh right, luminosity is how much light a star emits, right?

They did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, so both stars have the same peak wavelength. I remember from blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength is related to temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T increases, lambda_max decreases, and vice versa.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point because the luminosity formula depends on radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both have the same T, but different radii, I can probably compare their luminosities just by looking at the radius part.

Wait, wait. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So if I let R2 be the radius of Star_2, R1 is 1.5 R2. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T part is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Oh, but wait, that's if everything else is the same.

But wait, the options are around 2.23 to 2.35. My calculation is 2.25, which is option A. But why is that not one of the other options? Oh, wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait the question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the peak wavelengths were measured as the same. So maybe the Doppler shift has to be considered here.

Wait, because when a star is moving, it shifts the wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted wavelengths would be redshifted. But the measured wavelengths are the same as Star_1, which isn't moving. So perhaps Star_2's temperature isn't what I thought. Because if it's moving, the observed wavelength would be different.

Hmm, but wait the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is the same. But the actual lambda_max emitted by each star would be different if they have different temperatures or velocities.

So let me think. Let's denote the actual (emitted) lambda_max for Star_1 as lambda1 and for Star_2 as lambda2. But because Star_
