Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these complex equilibria and stability constants. But let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, let me note the given data. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The thiocyanate concentration, [SCN^-], is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. 

Wait, stability constants—so these are formation constants, right? They tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the complexes form in the order from Co(II) to the higher ones. But I should make sure about the order. So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2- where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So the stability constants are beta1 for [Co(SCN)]^+, beta2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, beta3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^- and beta4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? Or wait, maybe the charges are different. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but for the purposes of calculating concentrations, perhaps the exact charge isn't important as long as the formation constants are given.

The problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)₂]^(something) complex. Wait, but the options are about all the cobalt species. So I need to find the fraction of all the Co species that are in the form [Co(SCN)₂]^?.

Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of ions depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN^- in this case).

I think the approach is to consider all possible species of Co in solution and find the fraction of each. Then, sum them all and find the percentage for the desired species.

The possible species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^- , and [Co(SCN)₄]^2-.

Wait, but how are the stability constants defined? The stability constant, βn, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Co²+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)ₙ]^2- - n? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think: the stability constant for the first complex (n=1) would be β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ( [Co²+][SCN^-] ). Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^0 / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^2 ), and so on.

Yes, that's right. So each higher complex is formed by adding another SCN^- ion to the previous complex.

So, the formation of each complex depends on the concentrations of the ligand and the previous complex.

So, the total cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co²+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)₂]^0 + [Co(SCN)₃]^- + [Co(SCN)₄]^2- = 0.01 M.

But calculating each of these would require setting up a system of equations, which could get complicated.

Alternatively, I can use the method of successive approximations or assume that the most stable complex dominates. But wait, with four different stability constants, I can't just assume the highest one is the main one. Because the ligand concentration also plays a role.

Let me list the stability constants again: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is the highest. So the [Co(SCN)3]^- complex has the highest stability. But wait, the fourth complex has a lower beta than the third. So after n=3, adding another SCN- (to form n=4) is less favorable.

Hmm, but the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So even if the beta for the higher complexes isn't that high, the higher ligand concentration may shift the equilibrium toward higher n.

Wait, but in any case, I need to calculate the fraction of each complex.

I think the way to approach this is to express each species in terms of [Co²+], and then sum them up.

Let me denote:

Let’s say [Co²+] = x.

Then, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0: β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN]^1) * [SCN] ) = β2 β1 x [SCN]^2.

Wait, but [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is formed from [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^-:

So, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN^-]) ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^0 * [SCN^-] = β3 * β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^3.

And [Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^- * [SCN^-] = β4 * β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but I think that's not exactly correct. Each step is an addition of another SCN^-.

Wait, the general approach is as follows:

The concentration of each complex can be written in terms of the previous one plus another ligand.

So, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * [Co²+][SCN^-]

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] = β2 * β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^0 [SCN^-] = β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^- [SCN^-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4

So each higher complex is built upon the previous by multiplying by the next β and [SCN^-].

So, substituting the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term.

First, compute the terms step by step.

Compute each complex in terms of x ([Co²+]).

Let me compute each term step by step:

Term for [Co²+] is x.

Term for [Co(SCN)]^+ is 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

Term for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 40 * (9 x * 0.1) * 0.1 = 40 * 0.9 x * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute each step with exponents.

Alternatively, let me compute the terms as products:

Term for [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

Term for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 * [Co(SCN)]^+ * [SCN] =40 * 0.9 x * 0.1 = 40 * 0.09 x = 3.6 x.

Term for [Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^0 * [SCN] = 63 * 3.6 x *0.1 = 63 * 0.36 x = 22.68 x.

Term for [Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^- * [SCN] =16 * 22.68 x * 0.1 = 16 * 2.268 x = 36.288 x.

Wait, so the species concentrations are:

Co²+: x.

CoSCN^+: 0.9x.

Co(SCN)₂^0: 3.6x.

Co(SCN)3^-:22.68x.

Co(SCN)4^2-:36.288x.

So, the sum of all these is the total cobalt concentration:

x + 0.9x + 3.6x + 22.68x +36.288x = 0.01 M.

Wait, let's add them up:

x (1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) = x * (1 +0.9 is 1.9; plus 3.6 is 5.5; plus 22.68 is 28.18; plus 36.288 is 64.468 ) = 64.468 x = 0.01.

So x = 0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

So x ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. So that's the third term, 3.6x.

So the concentration of that complex is 3.6 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 5.5836e-5 M.

Wait, wait. Wait no, wait: the terms are the concentrations of each species in terms of x. So I can compute each concentration.

Wait, but let me compute each term:

x = [Co²+] =1.551e-4 M.

[CoSCN^+] =0.9 x ≈ 1.396e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 =3.6 x≈5.583e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^- =22.68 x≈3.523e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- =36.288 x≈5.62e-3 M.

Wait, let me sum these up to verify:

1.551e-4 +1.396e-4 = 2.947e-4.

Plus 5.583e-4 → 8.53e-4.

Plus 3.523e-3 → 4.376e-3.

Plus 5.62e-3 → ~1.000e-2? Wait, 4.376e-3 +5.62e-3 is 1.0 (approx) 1e-2.

Which matches the total Co concentration of 0.01 M. So that's good.

Now, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So its concentration is 5.583e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M. So the fraction is (5.583e-4 ) / (0.01 ) = 0.05583 → 5.583%.

Wait, but wait, that's only 5.5%, which isn't one of the options. Hmm. The options are 16.9%, 25.6%, 38.1%, etc. So I must have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check my steps again. Maybe I messed up the math in calculating the sum.

Wait, wait—the terms were:

x = [Co²+] = 1.551e-4 M.

[CoSCN^+] =0.9 x = 1.396e-4.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 =3.6 x =5.583e-4.

[Co(SCN)3]^- =22.68 x =22.68 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 3.523e-3.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- =36.288 x=36.288 * 1.551e-4 ≈ 5.62e-3.

Wait, let me add these again:

1.551e-4 (Co²+) → 0.0001551

Plus 0.0001396 (CoSCN+) → 0.0002947

Plus 0.0005583 (CoSCN₂) → 0.000853

Plus 0.003523 (CoSCN3) → 0.004376

Plus 0.00562 (CoSCN4) → 0.010000 (1.0e-2), which matches.

So the fraction for Co(SCN)₂ is 0.0005583 / 0.01 = 0.05583 → 5.583%.

But the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake in which complex the question refers to.

Wait, the question says the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands. So [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is the correct species. But according to my calculation, this is about 5.5% of the total, which isn't any of the options. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I reversed the stability constants or the order. Let me check the given stability constants again:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps each β is for the next complex. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So maybe my approach was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the terms. Let me recompute each term.

Wait, let me recompute:

We have:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN^+] * [SCN] =40 * 0.9x *0.1 =40 *0.09x=3.6x.

[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)₂]^0 * [SCN] =63 *3.6x *0.1=63*0.36x=22.68x.

[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co(SCN)3]^- * [SCN] =16 *22.68x *0.1 =16 *2.268x= 36.288x.

Wait, that's correct.

So the sum is x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x (1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288) = x*(64.468)= 0.01.

So x=0.01/64.468≈1.551e-4 M.

So [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 3.6 x= 3.6 *1.551e-4 → 5.583e-4 M.

Total [Co] =0.01 M.

So 5.583e-4 /0.01 =5.583%, which is about 5.6%. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I misunderstood the question or made a miscalculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe each β is for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ -n}, and perhaps the way I'm calculating the concentrations is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the formation of each complex from the previous, but without considering all the factors correctly.

Wait, another approach—using the stepwise formation constants.

Another way is to compute the fraction of each species.

Let me think: after each addition of SCN^-, the fraction of each species can be determined based on the previous.

So, the fraction f_n for [Co(SCN)_n] is given by f_n = (β_n * [SCN] )/(1 + β_n * [SCN] + β_n β_{n+1} [SCN]^2 + ... )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the total concentration is the sum of all species, so each species can be expressed as a fraction of the total.

Let me define f_n as the fraction of [Co(SCN)_n].

So, f1 = ([CoSCN^+]) / [Co_total]

Similarly, f2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^0 / [Co_total], etc.

So, [CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN].

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [CoSCN^+] [SCN] = β2 β1 x [SCN]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co(SCN)_2]^0 [SCN] = β3 β2 β1 x [SCN]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co(SCN)_3]^- [SCN] = β4 β3 β2 β1 x [SCN]^4.

So, the sum is x (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )= [Co_total].

Thus,

x = [Co_total] / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

Once x is known, each f_n can be computed as:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... β_{n-1} [SCN]^{n-1} ) ) / denominator.

Wait, perhaps. Let me compute denominator D first.

Compute denominator D:

D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN] =0.1.

Compute each term:

Term1: 1.

Term2: β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 * 0.01=3.6.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9 *40 *63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360. 360*63=22680. 22680*16=362880. 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So, D=1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's add them:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9+3.6=5.5.

5.5+22.68=28.18.

28.18+36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So x = [Co_total] / D =0.01 /64.468≈1.551e-4 M.

Now, the fraction for the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 species is f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D.

Wait, no, wait. Because [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is after two ligands, so the coefficient would be β1 β2 [SCN]^2.

So f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D = (9*40*(0.1)^2) /64.468.

Compute numerator: 9*40=360; (0.1)^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6.

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557 → 5.57%.

Which brings us back to the same result as before, about 5.57%, which is roughly 5.6%. But none of the options match, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex, but in this case, perhaps it's the [Co(SCN)₂]^(something else), but I thought it was n=2. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is a different species, or perhaps I misapplied the beta values.

Alternatively, perhaps the beta values are given in a different way. Like, perhaps β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^+, etc. But that would change the way I compute each term.

Wait, perhaps the way the stability constants are defined is different. Let me think again about the definition of the stability constant.

The general formula is:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n²−] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

Wait, no, that's for the complex with n SCN. So [Co(SCN)_n]^charge = β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-].

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co²+][SCN^-]^3.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co²+][SCN^-]^4.

So, my previous approach is correct.

Hmm. If that's the case, perhaps the problem is not with the calculation but with the initial assumption of which complex is the blue one. Maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or another.

Wait, the question specifies "dithiocyanato" which implies two thiocyanate groups. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the correct one. So according to our calculations, it's about 5.5%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I need to double-check.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the question is asking for the percentage of all Co species except the free ion. Or perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says "among all cobalt containing species," which includes all: [Co²+], [CoSCN^+], [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the terms. Let me recompute the terms.

Denominator D is 64.468. So when calculating the fraction for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is term3=3.6, so 3.6/64.468=0.0557, which is 5.57%.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is not the one I'm computing. Wait, maybe the beta values are for the successive steps, so perhaps the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^3+, which would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the charges of the complexes are different, and I'm not considering that properly, which would change the equilibrium expressions.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given for the formation of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ -n} from the previous complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ -n} = β_n [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^{2+ -(n-1)} [SCN^-}.

In that case, the way to compute [Co(SCN)_n] would be as follows:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} = β_n [Co(SCN)_{n-1}]^{charge - SCN} [SCN^-}.

Which would change the way the concentrations are computed.

Wait, but in that case, the total cobalt would be sum of all [Co(SCN)_n] species.

But no, that doesn't change the way I computed each term because each step is a multiplication by β and [SCN^-}.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the charge when calculating the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the beta values are for the overall formation from Co²+ and n SCN^-.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%.

None of these are about 5.5%, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator D is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Substituting the numbers:

β1=9, [SCN]=0.1.

Term 1:1.

Term2:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3:9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6.

Term4:9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) *0.001=22.68.

Term5:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880) * 0.0001=36.288.

Adding them all:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. So D=64.468.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all Co species except the free ion. So then, the total would be 1 - (x / 0.01 M) → 1 - ( [Co²+] / [Co_total] ).

But according to our calculation, [Co²+] is 1.551e-4 M. So x is 1.551e-4, and the other species sum to 0.01 - 1.551e-4 ≈0.0098449 M. So the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be (5.583e-4 /0.0098449 ) *100 ≈5.678%. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have accounted for the fact that each complex has a charge, which affects activity coefficients, but I think that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 as (3.6 x) / (0.01) × 100.

Wait, 3.6 x is 3.6 * 1.551e-4 =5.583e-4.

So 5.583e-4 /0.01 = 0.05583 → 5.583%.

Wait, but that's not any of the options. I'm getting stuck here because none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the beta values. Let me think: perhaps β3 is 16 and β4 is 63. No, the problem says β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that's correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps I have the order of the stability constants reversed. Like, perhaps the complexes are more stable in a different order. But no, β3=63 is the largest, so the most stable is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that in the denominator, I added all terms correctly, but maybe the [Co(SCN)_4] term is not correct because β4 is less than β3.

Wait, perhaps when β4 is less than β3, the higher complexes may not form as much. But in our calculation, [Co(SCN)_4] is the highest concentration because [SCN] is high, but perhaps with β4 being lower, this affects the distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have stopped at [Co(SCN)_3], since β4 is lower, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the error is that I'm considering all four complexes, but the problem only considers up to a certain number. But the problem states that the stability constants are given for four complexes, so I think all four should be considered.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the formation constants in a different way, maybe as the cumulative constants rather than the stepwise. That is, K1=β1, K2=β2*β1, K3=β3*β2*β1, K4=β4*β3*β2*β1.

Wait, but that's what I did with D= 1 + K1[SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

So I think I'm correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage in terms of moles of SCN bound, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me think again: D=1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_3]^- instead. Let me calculate that fraction.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- is term4=22.68x.

So f3=22.68 x /0.01 = (22.68 * 1.551e-4 ) / 0.01 = (0.003523) /0.01 =0.3523 →35.23%.

That's close to option C) 38.1%, but not exactly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have included all possible species, including Co(SCN)_n with n beyond 4, but the problem gives only up to n=4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recheck:

Term1:1.

Term2:0.9.

Term3:3.6.

Term4:22.68.

Term5:36.288.

Adding them:1+0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468. So D=64.468.

So, perhaps I should double-check the fractions.

Wait, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_4] is term5=36.288x /0.01.

36.288 x =36.288 *1.551e-4 ≈5.62e-3.

So 5.62e-3 /0.01 =56.2% of the total.

But that's even higher than the option C.

Hmm. So the fractions are:

f1=0.9x: 0.9 *1.551e-4 =1.396e-4 →1.396e-4 /0.01=1.396% →≈1.4%.

f2=3.6x→5.583e-4 →5.583% →≈5.6%.

f3=22.68x →3.523e-3 →35.23%.

f4=36.288x →5.62e-3 →56.2%.

So, the percentages are approximately 1.4%,5.6%, 35.2%,56.2% for the four species.

Wait, but the sum of these percentages is 1.4 +5.6=7; 7+35.2=42.2; +56.2=98.4. But the total must be 100% because all Co is accounted for.

Ah, because I only considered up to four complexes, but perhaps the higher complexes beyond four are possible, but the problem states that the stability constants are given only up to four, so perhaps we can ignore anything beyond.

Wait, no, because [Co] total is given as 0.01 M, and all species are accounted for in the four terms.

Wait, 1.4+5.6=7, +35.2=42.2, +56.2=98.4. So, missing about 1.6%. But in reality, perhaps the free Co²+ is 1.551e-4, which is 0.1551% of the total, so the sum is 0.1551 + [f1 + f2 +f3 +f4 ]= 0.1551+ (1.396 +5.583 +35.23 +56.2 ) → wait, no, because f is the fraction, so [Co²+] is f0= x/0.01 =1.551e-4 /0.01=0.01551 →1.551%, and the other fractions add up to 1.4+5.6+35.2+56.2=98.4%. So total is 1.551 +98.4 =99.95%, which is approximately 100%, considering rounding.

Hmm, so none of the options match the calculated 5.5% for [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about which complex is being asked.

Wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." I'm assuming dithiocyanato means two SCN groups, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or another.

Wait, I'm not a chemistry expert, but I remember that the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green or another color. So in that case, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one. So the fraction is about 5.6%, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: perhaps the question considers all complexes up to n=3, and the 4th isn't formed. But that would require a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are for different n. Like, perhaps β1 is for the first complex, β2 the second, etc., but maybe the numbering is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, but perhaps each complex with two SCN contributes. Wait, no, each [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is a single species. So that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that none of the options match my calculation, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, but when the complexes form, the free [SCN^-] decreases. But in this case, since [SCN] is in excess, perhaps we can assume it's approximately constant, which is a common approximation in such problems.

So, that's probably correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given for the formation of the complex, but perhaps I should have considered the inverse, but that would make the complexes less stable, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the formation of each complex depends on the previous one, but perhaps I missed a step in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to write the ratio of each complex to the previous one, and then compute the fractions based on those ratios.

For example:

The ratio [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co(SCN)_{n-1}] = β_n [SCN^-}.

So, for n=1, [CoSCN^+] / [Co²+] = β1 [SCN^-}.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / [CoSCN^+] = β2 [SCN^-}.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- / [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β3 [SCN^-}.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- / [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β4 [SCN^-}.

So, the ratios are:

r1 = β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

r2 = β2 [SCN] =40 *0.1=4.

r3 = β3 [SCN] =63 *0.1=6.3.

r4 = β4 [SCN] =16 *0.1=1.6.

These ratios tell us how much each complex is favored over the previous one.

So, starting from [Co²+] = x.

[CoSCN^+] = x * r1=0.9x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = [CoSCN^+] * r2=0.9x *4=3.6x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = [Co(SCN)_2]^0 * r3=3.6x *6.3=22.68x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = [Co(SCN)_3}^- * r4=22.68x *1.6=36.288x.

Which brings us back to the same terms as before, and the same denominator D=64.468.

So I think this approach is correct, but the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is still about 5.5%, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all the Co in the form of dithiocyanato, but perhaps for all possible species with exactly two SCN ligands. But no, in this case, it's only [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to only consider complexes up to [Co(SCN)_3}^-. Let me compute the fractions up to n=3.

So D would be 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3.

Which is 1+0.9+3.6+22.68=28.18.

So x=0.01 /28.18 ≈3.55e-4.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 =3.6 x ≈1.278e-4 M.

So fraction f2= 1.278e-4 /0.01 =0.01278 →1.278%.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering all four complexes, but the problem is only considering up to [Co(SCN)_3}^-.

But no, the problem gives β4, which suggests that it's considered.

Another possibility: perhaps the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_4}^2- is actually β4=16, but perhaps it's [Co(SCN)_4}^-2, so the way I compute the terms is slightly different. But I don't think that affects the fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions using the ratios r1, r2, etc., and then compute the fractions based on those.

Starting with [Co²+] =x.

[CoSCN^+] =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0=4 *0.9 x=3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3}^- =6.3 *3.6 x=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4}^2- =1.6 *22.68 x=36.288 x.

So, each step is multiplied by the ratio r.

The fractions would be:

f0 = x / (x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x) =x/(64.468x) =1/64.468≈0.01551 →1.551%.

f1 =0.9x/(64.468x)=0.9/64.468≈0.01396 →1.396%.

f2=3.6x/(64.468x)=3.6/64.468≈0.0557 →5.57%.

f3=22.68x/(64.468x)=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

f4=36.288x/(64.468x)=36.288/64.468≈0.562 →56.2%.

So the fractions are as before. So the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is about 5.57% which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about which complex is blue.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3}^-. Let me compute its fraction.

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%.

Which is close to option C)38.1%, but not exactly. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

But why would the question refer to [Co(SCN)_3}^- as the dithiocyanato complex? Because it has three SCN groups. Dithiocyanato implies two.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of the stability constants. Maybe the stability constants are given as K = [complex]/([Co²+][SCN]^n). So I think that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc., but perhaps each β refers to a cumulative constant. Like, β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc., but perhaps they are cumulative, so that β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2}^0.

Wait, if that's the case, then the approach would be different. Let me think:

If β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)_1}^+, then β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2}^0, etc.

But then, if the stability constants are cumulative, the way to calculate the fractions would be:

[Co(SCN)_n}^{charge} = βn [Co²+][SCN]^n.

In that case, the denominator D would be 1 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Which would make D=1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

Term1:1.

Term2:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3:40 *0.01=0.4.

Term4:63 *0.001=0.063.

Term5:16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Adding these:1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

So x=0.01 /2.3646≈4.222e-3 M.

Then, the concentration for [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2=40 *4.222e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.222e-3 *0.01=40 *4.222e-5=1.6888e-3.

So fraction f2=1.6888e-3 /0.01 =0.16888 →16.888%.

Which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Ah! So that must be the correct approach. I think I see where I went wrong. Earlier, I assumed that the stability constants are stepwise, but perhaps they're given as cumulative constants. That is, each βn is the overall stability constant for forming the [Co(SCN)_n} complex from Co²+ and n SCN^-.

So in that case, the denominator D is the sum of the terms where each term is βn [SCN]^n.

So the fraction for [Co(SCN)_2}^0 is (β2 [SCN]^2 ) / D.

Which gives us 40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4. D=2.3646. So 0.4/2.3646≈0.1689 →16.89%, which rounds to 16.9%, option D.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 0.01 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constant βₙ represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex [Co(SCN)ₙ] from Co²⁺ and n SCN⁻ ions.
   - The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species: Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.

2. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The denominator \( D \) is the sum of contributions from all cobalt species:
     \[
     D = 1 + \beta_1[\text{SCN}] + \beta_1\beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1\beta_2\beta_3[\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1\beta_2\beta_3\beta_4[\text{SCN}]^4
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot 0.1^4)
     \]
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
     \]

3. **Concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   - The concentration of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is proportional to \( \beta_1\beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2 \):
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = \beta_1\beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2 \cdot \frac{c(\text{Co})}{D}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = (9 \cdot 40 \cdot 0.1^2) \cdot \frac{0.01}{64.468} = 3.6 \cdot \frac{0.01}{64.468} \approx 5.583 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}
     \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:
   - The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0]}{c(\text{Co})} = \frac{5.583 \times 10^{-4}}{0.01} \approx 0.05583 \, (5.583\%)
     \]

5. **Revisiting Stability Constants**:
   - If the stability constants are interpreted as cumulative constants, the denominator \( D \) is recalculated as:
     \[
     D = 1 + \beta_1[\text{SCN}] + \beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3[\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4[\text{SCN}]^4
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     D = 1 + (9 \cdot 0.1) + (40 \cdot 0.1^2) + (63 \cdot 0.1^3) + (16 \cdot 0.1^4)
     \]
     \[
     D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]
   - The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is then:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2[\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{40 \cdot 0.1^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.1689 \, (16.89\%)
     \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) is approximately **16.9%**, which matches option **D**.
