Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. So, the setup is a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And they've given some options.

Hmm, right. So, speed of light in a medium is usually given by c divided by the index of refraction, right? Oh wait, but wait, that's the speed in the rest frame of the medium. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the lab frame. So I guess I need to consider how the speed of light transforms when the medium is moving.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So, if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, how does that affect its speed as observed from the lab?

Let me recall, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. Oh wait, but the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's non-relativistic? Or does it matter? Because if v is small compared to c, then maybe we can use the Galilean transformation. But wait, the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so perhaps we should consider relativistic effects.

Wait, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think. The speed of light in the glass, in its rest frame, is c/n. Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the phase velocity in the medium. So v_phase = c/n.

Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but light's speed is tricky because it's invariant in special relativity. Oh wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium isn't invariant in the lab frame. Wait, no, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum, but in a medium, it's slower. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The glass is moving, so its velocity is v. The light is moving
