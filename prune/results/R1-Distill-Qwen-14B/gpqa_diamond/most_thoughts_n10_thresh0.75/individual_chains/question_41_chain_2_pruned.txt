Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about the speed of light in a moving medium. Oh, right, like when something is moving through glass or another medium, how does that affect the light's speed as observed from the lab.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the glass is moving in the direction the light is going, but since it's moving toward the observer, I guess that's the same as the beam's direction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the beam is moving through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. So the glass's velocity is in the same direction as the beam's propagation, and towards the observer. So if the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them, that must mean the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Because the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam.

The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, right, the speed of light in the medium is typically c/n, where n is the refractive index. But here the medium is moving, so we have to consider the relative motion between the medium and the observer.

Wait, so in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v. So we need to
