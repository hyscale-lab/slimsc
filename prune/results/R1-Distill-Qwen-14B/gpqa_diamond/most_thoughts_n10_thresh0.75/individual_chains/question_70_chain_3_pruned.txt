Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I have to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, each representing a different point group.

Let me break down the given information.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The use of 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. So the reaction might be A + 8B → C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. So C + 2D → E. And E is extremely hazardous, so maybe a toxic gas or something like that.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H (1:1). Since H is a solvent, maybe something like HCl or ethanol? Wait, but D is a gas. Hmm.

Let me think about what these substances could be. 

Looking at the third reaction, C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid and G a weak one. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include H2CO3, H3PO4, etc.

Wait, when a compound reacts with water to form an acid, it might be a salt. For example, if C is a metal nitrate, then reaction with water might not produce a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide or a carbonate. Wait, but if C is a metal oxide, then reacting with water would form a metal hydroxide, but that's not an acid. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a sulfide or a nitride. For example, if C is FeS, reacting with water might produce Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, reacting with water would produce NaOH and CO2, but CO2 is a weak acid. Then F would be a strong acid, so perhaps if C is a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the first reaction. Product C is bright red. What compounds are bright red? Perhaps something like Fe(OH)3 isn't red. Wait, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfur compound. Wait, another thought: Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red.

Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate of a transition metal. Or perhaps it's a chromium compound, which can have different colors. Wait, another possibility: C is a copper(II) compound, but I don't think that's bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction produces E when C reacts with D. E is
