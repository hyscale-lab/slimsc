Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observations.

Let me read the question again. So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Oh wait, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, I guess.

The stars: Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Since Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they have the same radii... I remember that more massive stars usually have larger radii, but in this case, the Planet_1's star is more massive but same size. Maybe because it's not evolved yet or something.

So the main thing here is to find the transit probability for each planet. Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight, right? The formula for the probability is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, so sometimes it's approximated as R_star / a.

Wait, wait. I think the formula is (R_*) / a, because the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. So if a is larger (planet is farther away), the probability is lower.

So I need to compute R* / a for each planet. Then compare the two probabilities.

But wait, wait. The orbital period is given, not the semi-major axis. So I need to find a in terms of the period and the star's mass.

Oh right, Kepler's third law. The formula is (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4π²). But since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a^3 = (G M_*) P^2 / (4π²).

But wait, do I need to calculate a for each
