Okay, so I have this question about planets and the probability of detecting a transit. Hmm, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because it orbits faster. Also, their host stars have the same radii. Planet_1's star is more massive, twice as much as Planet_2's star. But the stars have the same radius, which is a bit unusual because more massive stars are typically larger. Oh wait, maybe Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which could mean it might have expanded a bit but not too much since their radii are the same.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability formula I remember is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius, but I might be mixing it up. Wait, no, the transit probability is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in units of the star's radius) multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, another approach: the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² divided by (a_planet / R_star), but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the transit probability formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² / (a_p / R_s). No, I think I'm mixing things. Wait, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a_p). Because the area where the planet can transit is a circle with radius a_p, so the probability is (pi R_p²) / (pi a_p²) ) which is (R_p / a_p)^2. But wait, no, the probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the area of the planet's orbit. Wait, that's not quite right.

Let me think again. The probability of transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a), multiplied by the ratio of the
