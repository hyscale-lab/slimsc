Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which describes an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So they form an orthonormal basis, I think. So first, maybe I should normalize the state to find the actual coefficients.

Wait, to find the probabilities when measuring in some eigenstate, I need to know the possible outcomes. But the question is a bit more involved. Let me see what it's asking. Oh, it's about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix is given. The matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, I guess.

So the operator's matrix looks like this:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero (since i=j gives A_ij=0), and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Oh wait, actually, for a 2x2 matrix, i and j can be 1 and 2. So, positions (1,2) and (2,1) are hbar/2, others zero.

Wait, but what operator has such a matrix? Oh, I think that might be the Pauli X operator scaled by hbar/2. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, this operator would be (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and their eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, but why is this operator important? Because the eigenstates of this operator are what we're measuring when we do a measurement. So the question is asking for the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of this operator, and also the expectation value (average) of the operator.

So, to proceed, I need to find the eigenstates of this operator A. Or perhaps I can diagonalize it. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, maybe its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates. Because if you multiply a matrix by a scalar, the eigenvectors remain the same, but the eigenvalues scale by that scalar.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are the spin states in the x-direction. Oh right, they are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. 

But wait, maybe I should just go through the process. Let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

The matrix A is:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

To find the eigenvalues, solve det(A - λI) =0.

So, determinant of [ -λ, hbar/2; hbar/2, -λ ] is λ² - (hbar²/4) =0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for λ = hbar/2: solving (A - (hbar/2)I) v =0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

The equations from this matrix are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as (1, 1) multiplied by a constant. To make it a unit vector, it would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2, the matrix becomes:

[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Which gives equations:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized to (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: the matrix A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. So the eigenvalues are (hbar/2) * 1 and (hbar/2) * (-1), which matches what I found before.

So, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I need to normalize this state first.

But wait, the problem says it's proportional, so perhaps the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, but not necessarily normalized. So I need to compute its norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|² + |2-i|².

Calculating each term: |1+i|^2 = (1^2 +1^2)= 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7, so the norm is sqrt(7). So to make it a proper state vector, |alpha> should be (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are ±hbar/2, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in each eigenstate.

So, to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2, we need to find the overlap between |alpha> and |+x>, and take the square of its magnitude.

Similarly for |-x>.

So let's compute the components.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the inner product < +x | alpha > is [ (1/sqrt(2)) * ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it in terms of components.

Let me think of |alpha> as a vector in the basis |up>, |down>. So it's a vector with components [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ].

Similarly, |+x> is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

The inner product is the conjugate of |+x> dotted with |alpha>.

Wait no, the inner product < +x | alpha > is the conjugate transpose of |+x> multiplied by |alpha>.

So, |+x> is a column vector [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T.

So the inner product is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^* times the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Wait, but I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again: the inner product is the sum over components: ( (1/sqrt(2)) ) * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) ) * ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ).

Wait, no, wait: since |+x> is ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2), the components when expressed in the |up>, |down> basis are [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(2)) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

Simplify that: [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Calculating numerator: 1 +i +2 -i = 3. So 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

So the amplitude is 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the magnitude of this amplitude. Since the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14), the probability is (3^2)/14 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, (1+i) is (1, i), and (2 - i) is (2, -i). So when I add them, (1+i) + (2 -i)=3. So yeah, that's right. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is (3/sqrt(14))² =9/14 ≈ 0.64286.

Similarly, the inner product for |-x> is < -x | alpha >.

The |-x> state is ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2). So components are [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

So inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Which is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Calculating numerator: 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So the inner product is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, wait, that's 5/14, which is approximately 0.35714.

But wait, the probabilities should sum to 1, and 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → 9/14 is ~0.6428 (exactly 9/14 is about 0.642857), so 0.64 is close. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, so 0.36 is close.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → 9/14 is about 0.6428, 0.61 is off.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → no, 0.54 is about 5/9, which is not matching.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → no.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which points to option A.

Wait, but let's check the average value of the operator. That's the expectation value <A>.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a 2x2 matrix, [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

Express |alpha> as a column vector:

(1+i)/sqrt(7)  
(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So |alpha> is:

[ (1+i)/√7, (2 -i)/√7 ]^T.

Then, A |alpha> is:

[ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/√7, (hbar/2)*(1 +i)/√7 ]^T.

Because the matrix multiplies the vector:

First component: 0*(1+i)/√7 + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/√7 → (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/√7.

Second component: (hbar/2)*(1+i)/√7 + 0*(2 -i)/√7 → (hbar/2)*(1 +i)/√7.

So A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/√7 , (hbar/2)(1 +i)/√7 ]^T.

Then, <alpha | A | alpha> is the conjugate of the first component times the first component of A|alpha>, plus the conjugate of the second component times the second component of A|alpha>.

Wait, no. Wait, let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

|alpha> is a column vector. So <alpha| is a row vector: [ (1-i)/√7 , (2 +i)/√7 ].

So <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1-i)/√7 , (2 +i)/√7 ] multiplied by A |alpha>, which is the vector [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/√7 , (hbar/2)(1 +i)/√7 ].

So the product is:

(1-i)/√7 * (hbar/2)(2 - i)/√7 + (2 +i)/√7 * (hbar/2)(1 + i)/√7.

Let me compute each term.

First term:

(1-i)(2 -i) * (hbar)/(2*7) → ( (1)(2) +1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2 ) * hbar/(14).

Simplify numerator: 2 -i -2i + (-1) → (2-1) + (-3i) → 1 -3i.

So first term: (1 -3i) * hbar/(14).

Second term:

(2 +i)(1 +i) * (hbar)/(2*7).

Multiply (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2 → 2 +3i -1 → (1 +3i).

So second term: (1 +3i) * hbar/(14).

Adding both terms: (1 -3i +1 +3i) * hbar/(14) = (2) * hbar/(14) = hbar/(7).

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64, 5/14≈0.36, and average hbar/7.

Which matches option A: "0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7".

So the answer should be A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are orthonormal eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. First, we normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \). The norm squared is:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, and its eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we compute the overlap of \( |\alpha\rangle \) with \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The inner products are:

\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these amplitudes:

\[
P(+\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left|\langle +x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{3^2}{14} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64286,
\]

\[
P(-\frac{\hbar}{2}) = \left|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.35714.
\]

Finally, we calculate the expectation value of \( A \). Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( |\alpha\rangle \), we find:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{(1+i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)}{7}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(1+i)(2-i) = 2 - i + 2i - i^2 = 2 + i + 1 = 3 + i,
\]
\[
(2+i)(1+i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i.
\]

Adding these:

\[
(3+i) + (1+3i) = 4 + 4i.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the expectation value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**

Answer: A
