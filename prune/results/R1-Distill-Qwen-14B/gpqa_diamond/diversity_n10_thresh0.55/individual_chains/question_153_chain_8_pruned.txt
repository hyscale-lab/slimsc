Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's think about each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C, each describing a Michael addition reaction. I need to determine the products for each and match with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate equivalent. The other reactant has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2-C(O)OCH3 attached to a double bond with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no, wait. The structure is probably CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the acrylate. Oh wait, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon: CH2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2COOCH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is substituting on the beta carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, maybe it's CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is actually CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Oh wait, maybe it
