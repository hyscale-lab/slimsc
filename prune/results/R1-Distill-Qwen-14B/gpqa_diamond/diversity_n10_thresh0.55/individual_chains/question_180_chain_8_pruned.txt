Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. Also, the mass is negligible, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential.

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P is where the 13th charge is. The others are all 2 meters away from P. So, imagine a sphere around P with radius 2 meters, and 12 charges are on the surface of this sphere.

We need to find the minimum energy of the system. Wait, energy in electrostatics usually refers to electric potential energy. So the system's potential energy is what we're calculating.

I remember that the potential energy of a configuration of point charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But for multiple charges, we calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all up.

So the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988e9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait
