Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed, v_max, of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. Oh, right, and it's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, but since it's relativistic, I guess we have to consider special relativity effects, like the increase in mass due to velocity approaching the speed of light.

Wait, but how does that work with the harmonic oscillator? In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so that can't be the answer.

Right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It should be the total energy minus the rest energy. The total energy for a relativistic particle is gamma*m*c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

But wait, the
