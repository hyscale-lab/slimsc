Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

First, the question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all related to C6H and varying O and H counts. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Looking at the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical for -OH groups. Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch, maybe from an ester or ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Could that be an aromatic C=C stretch? Or maybe another carbonyl group in a different environment, like conjugated with something else?

Wait, 1700 is more like ester or ketone, maybe. 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an amide? But wait, the problem doesn't mention any N, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is due to a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or maybe a ring current in an aromatic system.

Wait, another thought: if the compound has both carbonyl groups, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Oh wait, 1650 is in the range of C=C stretching for aromatic rings. So maybe that's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group nearby, like in a ketone or an ester attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but the problem says the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably O-H. So maybe it's a carbonyl-containing compound with an OH group. Like a carboxylic acid? But wait, car
