Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with a liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases substance B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius, because I remember that water freezes at 273 K (0Â°C), so maybe B is something that's a solid near that temperature. 

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So I'm thinking X might be something like a strong base or maybe a halogen, because reagents like NaOH or something else similar.

Wait, the first part says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope with a heavier mass, probably something like Cl-35 or Cl-37? Or maybe it's another element where isotopes are common, like carbon or oxygen. But in the context of organic reagents, perhaps it's something like HCl or NaOH?

But wait, X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Common reactions could be metals reacting with acids, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is something like a halogen, which can react with certain liquids. Wait, another thought: Li reacts with water violently, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, let's think about the gas W. It's produced when X reacts with Y. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's see, possible gases from such reactions: H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons would be 2, neutrons would be 8 (for O), so not equal. Oh wait, what about H2 (but that would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons in each molecule, which doesn't match). Wait, maybe CO2? No, that's 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's C-12), but CO2 has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think: the gas has equal number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule, each atom contributes its own protons and neutrons. Wait, but the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. Or each molecule has same number of each. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like O2. O2 has 8 protons each, so two atoms would be 16 protons. Neutrons: each O is 8 neutrons (if O-16), so two atoms would be 16 neutrons. So protons (16) equals neutrons (16). That fits. So W is O2.

Alternatively, another option is H2O. Let's see, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So H2O has total protons 2 + 8 =10, total neutrons 8. Not equal. So that's not it. Another possibility: maybe NH3? But that's a liquid at STP, I think.

Another gas to consider is CH4 (methane). But CH4 has 6 protons (from C) + 4*1 (H) = 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons, H has 0. So total neutrons 6. 10 protons, 6 neutrons: not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, what about O3? Ozone. Each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons. O3 has 3 O atoms. So protons: 24, neutrons: 24. That would fit.
