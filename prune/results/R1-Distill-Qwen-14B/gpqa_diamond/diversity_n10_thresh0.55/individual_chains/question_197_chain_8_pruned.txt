Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. The data given are the IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing these.

Looking at the IR data:
- The peaks around 3400â€“2500 cm-1 suggest O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's no peak around 1550 cm-1 (which is more typical for N-H), it's probably O-H. The broadness might indicate an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, the IR also shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H around 2500-3300 (which is the case here) and a strong C=O around 1700. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an ester would have C=O around 1740, maybe, but 1720 is more in line with a carboxylic acid. Also, the 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches.

Now the NMR data. Let's go through each peak:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. A broad singlet. Carboxylic acid protons usually appear around 10-12 ppm.
