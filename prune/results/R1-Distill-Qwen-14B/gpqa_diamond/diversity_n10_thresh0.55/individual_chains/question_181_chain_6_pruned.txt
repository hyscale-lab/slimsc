Okay, so I have this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of flux between two energy bands after a certain reaction stops. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are the same. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So if the pp-III process stopped, the neutrinos from that process wouldn't reach us for that time. But neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so they would have been unaffected in their journey. Wait, no, because if the process stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos from that process that were emitted before the stop would still be traveling. But the current emission from pp-III would stop, so after that time, the neutrinos from pp-III would no longer be reaching Earth.

Wait, but the problem is about the flux of neutrinos detected now, right? So the pp-III neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and their emission depends on the pp-III process. If the process stopped, the emission would stop. But since the Sun's processes happen over a long time, but the neutrinos travel for about 8.5 minutes, maybe the flux we detect now would decrease because the source (pp-III) has stopped.

Wait, the question isn't about the total flux but the ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out what the pp-III branch contributes to these bands and how their ratio changes when pp-III stops.

I remember that the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch produces high-energy neutrinos, while pp-II and pp-III have lower energies. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The main proton-proton chain, pp-I, produces two positrons and two neutrinos. The pp-II branch might involve a different reaction, perhaps with a higher mass, and the same for pp-III.

Wait, according to what I remember, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos at lower energies. So when the pp-III branch stops, the number of lower-energy neutrinos would drop. But in this case, the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. Hmm, so if pp-III was the main source for, say, lower energy neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the lower energy flux more than the higher ones. But wait, what's the energy range of neutrinos from pp-III?

Alternatively, maybe pp-III is a higher energy contributor. Wait, perhaps I should recall: neutrinos from the Sun are mainly from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos with energies around 250 keV, but wait, that's the standard pp-I. Wait, no, the neutrinos from the pp chain are from the beta decay steps, so their energies are a few hundred keV. Let me think: in the pp chain (pp-I), each neutrino has an energy of about 511 keV. Then, the pp-II branch is a side reaction that produces higher-energy neutrinos? Or is it lower?

Wait, I
