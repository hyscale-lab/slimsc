Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, it's about a star with certain characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the temperature and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let's break this down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait, that might not be right. Oh, wait, the question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases when spots are present. Hmm, but wait, spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the star, the observed effective temperature (as measured from afar) would go down, right? So I think that's how it works.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the populations of two energy levels. The ratio depends on the temperature because of Boltzmann's equation. The formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. Because spots are cooler, but wait, in the problem, it says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that work? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. So the overall effective temperature is a combination of the two areas. Oh, wait, the Teff is the average as observed, so maybe it's a weighted average based on the areas?

Wait, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So that must be the observed effective temperature of the entire star, taking into
