Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have a bunch of identical systems—10,000 of them. Each has a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) – 0.5i. When they measure the position, none of the particles are found outside the region x=1 to x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus (the probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space. Because the probabilities must sum to 1, right? So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that down:

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i

Since the wave function has both real and imaginary parts, the modulus squared will be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary components. So |ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)².

Because for any complex number ψ = A + iB, |ψ|² = A² + B².

So |ψ(x)|² = [a² / (1 + x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function ψ must satisfy the normalization condition. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

So the integral becomes ∫[a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3. Let me compute this.

Breaking it into two terms:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).
