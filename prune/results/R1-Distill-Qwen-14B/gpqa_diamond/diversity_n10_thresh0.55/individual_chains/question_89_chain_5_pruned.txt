Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to figure it out.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm not super familiar with adamantane, but I know it's a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so it's a pretty rigid structure. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which probably has two bromine atoms attached at the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane skeleton.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so it's likely inducing some kind of elimination or substitution. Since we have two bromine atoms, maybe an E2 elimination is happening. Adamantane is a very stable structure, so perhaps the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons or in positions that allow for the formation of a double bond. If they eliminate, it would form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would likely lose two HBr molecules, forming an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or perhaps a single double bond if that's possible.

Wait, but how many HBr would each Br eliminate? If each Br is on adjacent carbons, each could lose one HBr. So, perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but considering excess KOH, perhaps both Br atoms are eliminated.

The product is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch). Wait, that's a bit confusing because elimination would typically form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides have a different IR region. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an elimination to form an enol, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction leading to a ketone. Because if the Br is replaced by an -OH group, but KOH is a base, so perhaps more likely elimination. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. When dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But in this case, the product has an IR peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, maybe ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction
