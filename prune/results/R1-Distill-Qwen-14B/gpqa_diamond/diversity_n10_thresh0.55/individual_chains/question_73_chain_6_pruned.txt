Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally because of the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is different. So for relative speed, I can't just subtract the two speeds directly.

Wait, the question asks for the relative speed. So I think that means astronaut 1's speed relative to astronaut 2. Because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference of their velocities, but considering relativity. Hmm, but wait, in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. Oh, right, I should use the velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when observing from frame S' (which is moving at velocity u relative to S) is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight. Let me define the frames. Let's say the first astronaut is in frame S, moving at 0.6c. The second astronaut is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second?

Wait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. If both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference in their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no—wait. Let me recall the velocity addition formula. The formula when you have two frames S and S' moving at velocity v relative to S. An object moving at u in S will have velocity u' in S' given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Oh wait, so if S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then u' is the object's speed in S'.

In this problem, we have two objects: astronaut A (mass 2m, speed 0.6c) and astronaut B (mass 3m, speed 0.5c). Both are moving in the same direction. Let's consider the frame of A. Then, the speed of B in A's frame would be (0
