Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when measuring the position, none of the particles were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside that region. My job is to find the numerical value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that for a wave function to be valid, the total probability must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1. But in this case, the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, so the integral is from 1 to 3.

Oh wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, is that a complex function? Because I see an 'i' which is the square root of -1. So the wave function is complex. But when calculating the probability, I need to take the absolute square of the wave function.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|². So ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the absolute square.

The absolute square of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So here, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0
