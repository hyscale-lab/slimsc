Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I'm still trying to get my head around. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative speed and energy.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things aren't as straightforward as classical mechanics. So for relative speed, I can't just subtract them because that would be the case in Newtonian physics. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame, right? The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, are u and v the speeds of the two astronauts as measured in the same frame? Oh, right, the problem says they're moving in the same direction—so one is at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c. So from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the speed of the other?

Wait, but let me think: from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, what is the speed of the one moving at 0.5c? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, relative speed isn't symmetric, so I have to be careful about which frame I'm considering.

Wait, actually, the problem says "relative speed" without specifying direction. Oh wait no, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So the astronaut moving faster (0.6c) would see the other moving at a lower speed relative to him. Or am I getting that wrong?

Wait, no, in the frame where both are moving, the relative speed between them would be calculated based on their velocities. Let me get the formula right. The relative velocity of the second astronaut as seen from the first one can be found using the formula for relative velocity in relativity.

Wait, another approach: Let me set up the frames. Let's say we're in the rest frame where both astronauts are moving. The first is moving at u = 0.6c, the second at v = 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame (the one moving at 0.6c), what's the speed of the second astronaut?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is when you're in a frame moving at velocity V, and you want to find the velocity of another object moving at velocity u in the original frame. The formula is u' = (u - V)/(1 - (u*V)/(c²)).

So in this case, let's say the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c in the lab frame. The second is moving at v = 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's perspective (let's call this frame S'), the velocity of the second astronaut (u') would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Let me calculate that numerator and denominator. Numerator: 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1
