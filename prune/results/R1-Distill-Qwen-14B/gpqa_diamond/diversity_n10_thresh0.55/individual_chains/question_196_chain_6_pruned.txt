Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think about what I know. So, the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. 

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use the classical formula.

Oh right, in relativity, the total energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is momentum. But for a harmonic oscillator, I guess the energy is quantized, but maybe that's not directly relevant here. Alternatively, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. And when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's actually E_kinetic = (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy E is γ mc² at maximum speed, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA², right? But wait, in relativity, I'm not sure if the potential energy is still treated the same way. Or is it? Maybe in this problem, the harmonic oscillator
