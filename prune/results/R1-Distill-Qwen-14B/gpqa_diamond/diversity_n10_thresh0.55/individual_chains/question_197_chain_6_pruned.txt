Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the spectral data given: the IR and the NMR. The goal is to figure out what compound X is, and then determine the reaction outcome.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are between 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the next peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. 1720 is a strong peak, typically for a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 could be from aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): That's a strong peak, possibly an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an exchange with D2O, which is common for acidic protons. But also, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but an aldehyde would be a triplet in some cases, or maybe a singlet if it's isolated. But sometimes in NMR, the aldehyde proton can be a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative?

Moving on:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 ppm is probably the more deshielded (electron-withdrawing groups) protons, and 7.2 could be the less deshielded. So maybe something like a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl in the structure, that would deshield the adjacent protons
