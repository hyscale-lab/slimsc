Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

So, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves in certain ways. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity would induce charges on the conductor. Wait, but the conductor was uncharged, so maybe the net charge is zero.

Let me recall: when a charge is inside a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, no, that's for a conductor with a cavity. Oh right, in this case, the conductor itself is neutral, but the cavity has a charge. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge equal and opposite to +q, and the outer surface would be... wait, since the conductor was neutral, the net charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it, right? Wait, no, because if the conductor is neutral, the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to cancel it, but wait, that's not possible because the conductor's net charge is zero. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Oh, wait. The conductor is originally neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero. So the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, because the inner surface is -q. Because conductor's total charge is inner (-q) plus outer (+q), which sums to zero. So that's correct.

Now, the question is about the electric field outside the conductor at point P. I remember that for a spherical conductor, the
