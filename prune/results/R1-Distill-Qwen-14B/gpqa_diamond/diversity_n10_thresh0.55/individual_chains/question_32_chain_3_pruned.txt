Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's Li-6 because lithium normally has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6.

The question is asking for the energy of the collider. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I remember that when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations.

First, I think the energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me plug in the numbers. v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c². v²/c² = (0.9216). So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately.

Then, I need the mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is known, and I can find the mass in kg, but perhaps it's easier to use the rest energy in GeV. Wait, the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 0.938 GeV/c² each. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the mass should be 6 * 0.938 GeV/c².

Wait, actually, I should be precise. The exact mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So mass m = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) MeV/c². Let me compute that:

3*(938.272) = 2814.816 MeV
3*(939.565) = 2818.695 MeV
Adding together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 563
