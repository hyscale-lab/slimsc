Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's happening here? Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which I remember is a nucleophile. So it's probably a nucleophilic addition.

In the product, the nitrile group is added, and there's a hydroxyl group. Wait, but where? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure must be something like NC-CH(C)(OH)CH3, but wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons. Let me draw this out.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN adds, it's a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon. Normally, in ketones, the nucleophile attacks, forming an addition product. But then what happens? Maybe it's a substitution? Wait, no, maybe it's a two-step process. The initial attack forms a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with both OH and CN groups adjacent.

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN and H+ gives a cyanohydrin. So when you add NaCN to a ketone under acidic conditions, you get this. So the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4 or something. Because in the formation of cyanohydrin, you need acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So A is probably H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. That's usually used in the reduction of ketones or aldehydes to form bisulfite adducts, which can then be used in other reactions. But in this case, the reaction is with NaCN, which I'm pretty sure is a substitution or addition reaction. So I don't think NaHSO3 is the reagent here. So maybe A is H3O+, so options A or B.

Now moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with re
