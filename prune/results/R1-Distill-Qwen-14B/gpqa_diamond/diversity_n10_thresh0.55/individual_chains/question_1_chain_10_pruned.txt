Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Which relates the uncertainty in energy and time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or sometimes it's written as ΔE ≈ ħ/(4πΔt), depending on the convention. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference (ΔE) between the two states is too small compared to the uncertainties, we can't distinguish them. So we need ΔE to be larger than a certain value to resolve them.

Let's see. The lifetimes here are given as τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s. Wait, but which lifetime do we use for the uncertainty? Oh, wait, the energy uncertainty would relate to each state's lifetime. Or maybe the question is considering the energy difference between the two states, so perhaps we should calculate the uncertainty for each and see.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in either state. Or perhaps the combined effect. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, each state has its own lifetime. The uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE_i ≈ ħ / (2τ_i) or something like that. So for state 1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1), and for state 2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2).

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let's call ΔE = E2 - E1. To be able to resolve them, this ΔE must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I think. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, it's hard to tell them apart.

Alternatively, another way: each state's energy has an uncertainty of about ħ/(2τ), so the minimum ΔE for distinguishability would be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the two uncertainties. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty is the smaller of the two? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I think the rule of thumb is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for either state. So ΔE must be greater than, say, the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is smaller than the uncertainty of one of the states, you can't really tell them apart.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, Planck's constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Alternatively, in eV·s, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-7 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = (6.582 / 2) * 1e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties for the two states are approximately 3.29e-7 eV and 3.29e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, but wait. Or should the uncertainty be ħ/τ, without the 2? Because the uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). So that's what I used above.

So to distinguish E
