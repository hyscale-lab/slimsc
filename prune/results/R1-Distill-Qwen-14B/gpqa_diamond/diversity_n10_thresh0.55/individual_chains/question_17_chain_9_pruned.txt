Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a specific concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. The given data includes the concentration of the complex, the formation constant (K), and the conditions are ideal pH and temperature (25°C). 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is stoichiometric, meaning the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1, right? So the complex is Ca-EDTA.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. And the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. 

Wait, the formation reaction would be something like: 
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- 

And the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, the only species present are the Ca-EDTA complex and maybe any free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions? Or is the solution only the complex, assuming it's fully formed? No, because K is given, so we have to account for the equilibrium.

So we're given [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. We need to find [Ca²+].

So the problem boils down to using the formation constant expression. Let's write it out:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-})

We know K is 5e10, and [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, what about [EDTA^4-]? 

Wait, in a stoichiometric solution, I think the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be the same because the complex forms in a 1:1 ratio. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-], let's call this x.

So substituting into the equation:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

Then, solving for x²: x² = 0.
