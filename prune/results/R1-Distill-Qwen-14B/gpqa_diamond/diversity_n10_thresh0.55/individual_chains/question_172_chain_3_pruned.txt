Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation! Right, the equation that relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Since the energy difference is given, I should use that.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, let me set up the variables. Let's say the excited state is level i and the lower state is j. So for star_1, n_i1/n_j1 = 2. For star_2, n_i2/n_j2 = 1, since it's half as excited? Or wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, perhaps the ratio is 2 times higher. So maybe the excitation ratio is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2.

But wait, the energy difference is fixed for both stars. So the (E_i - E_j) is the same, 1.38e-23 J for both stars. So each star's temperature affects the ratio of excited atoms.

Let me denote T1 as the temperature of star_1 and T2 as that of star_2. The ratio n_i/n_j for each star would be:

n_i1/n_j1 = exp( -(E)/(k_B T1) )
n_i2/n_j2 = exp( -(E)/(k_B T2) )

But according to the problem, n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). Wait, no, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So if star_2's ratio is, say, x, then star_1's is 2x. So:

n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2)

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

exp( -E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -E/(
