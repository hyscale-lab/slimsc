Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read through it again. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance called X. The given data includes the production energy (8 GeV), mass (1.2 GeV), and width (320 MeV). The options are A to D with some numbers and exponents, so I need to compute which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, particles that decay quickly don't travel far, right? So the mean decay length would be the product of the lifetime and the velocity, multiplied by the speed of light, I think. Or maybe just the velocity times the lifetime times c? Let me get the formula straight.

The mean decay distance, L, should be something like L = v * gamma * ctau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, and ctau is the proper lifetime times the speed of light. Or wait, maybe it's tau multiplied by the particle's velocity. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed is gamma tau. So the mean distance is v multiplied by gamma tau. Or perhaps I'm getting confused between velocity and gamma.

Let me think again. The mean lifetime of a particle is tau = h-bar / width (since width is the energy uncertainty, and using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). So the width Gamma is the inverse of the lifetime. So Gamma ≈ hbar / tau → tau ≈ hbar / Gamma.

But wait, the width Gamma here is given as 320 MeV. Oh, but units can get tricky. I'll have to
