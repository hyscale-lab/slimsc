Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can do.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which each star appears brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the ratio of their luminosities, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Right, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, the key here is to find the temperatures of both stars.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So, if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait a second, but the radial velocities are different. Oh, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the measured wavelengths could be different from the actual emitted wavelengths. Because Star_2 is moving towards us (since its radial velocity is 700 km/s, but wait, the sign depends on whether it's approaching or receding. If Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700, that means it's moving away, so the wavelengths would be redshifted. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I might be getting this part wrong.

Wait, no. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their peak emission) are the same. So does that mean the observed wavelengths from Earth are the same, or the actual emitted wavelengths are the same?

Wait, I think it's the observed wavelengths. Because the question says, "the wavelengths at which
