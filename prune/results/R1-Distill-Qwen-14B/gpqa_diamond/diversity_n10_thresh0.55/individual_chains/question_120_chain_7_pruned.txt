Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, 0.5 would be twice as far, and so on.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, if I consider a small change in parallax, say dplx, how many stars would fall into that range? And how does that change with the value of plx itself.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number depends on the volume of space they occupy. But wait, how does parallax relate to volume? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so larger parallax means closer stars.

Let me think about the distance in terms of parallax. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, if I consider a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance? Let's see, the lower limit is plx, which is 1/d, so the distance is d = 1/plx. The upper limit is plx + dplx, which would make the distance 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, but maybe I should think in terms of a small change. So for small dplx, the distance would change from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). But perhaps it's easier to consider the corresponding distance range.

Wait, if plx increases by a small amount dplx, then the distance changes. Let me think: The distance at plx is d = 1/plx, and at plx + dplx, it's d' = 1/(plx + dplx). The change in distance dd is d' - d = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. Let me compute that: it's [plx - (plx +
