Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, which have the same mass. They were detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but I'm not sure if that affects the transit probability directly.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. The key formula, I think, is the transit probability, which is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's often approximated as R_star / a_planet. Wait, no, that's the size of the area or something else. Oh wait, the transit probability is actually proportional to (R_star / a_planet) squared, or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. But wait, no, wait another thought. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit, or something like that. Or maybe the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on. No, wait, the probability is actually a function of the orbital inclination. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits from our point of view is higher when the star's size is larger and the planet's orbit is smaller.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability P is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (e * sqrt(1-e^2))) ) but since the orbits are circular, e=0. So the probability simplifies. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me recall: for a circular orbit, the approximate transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (some factor based on the inclination). Wait, no, the actual probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter, multiplied
