Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. There's a spherical conductor, uncharged, so initially no charge on it. Inside there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance 's' from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R, the radius of the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. I need to find the magnitude of E at this point. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, so the conductor is uncharged initially. When we place a charge inside the cavity, charges will redistribute on the conductor. I remember from Gauss's law that the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So any charges in the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. 

In this situation, since the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge on the conductor must remain zero. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance it out. 

Wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is uncharged, any charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. So the inner surface of the conductor (cavity side) will have -q. Then the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor's total charge at zero. 

So the electric field outside the conductor would be due to the charges on the outer surface. Since the outer surface has a charge of +q, the field outside should behave as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. Because from Gauss's law, the field outside depends only on the enclosed charge, which in this case is +q. 

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the field there should be the same as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center. 

Wait, but let me think again. The position of the charge inside the cavity might affect the
