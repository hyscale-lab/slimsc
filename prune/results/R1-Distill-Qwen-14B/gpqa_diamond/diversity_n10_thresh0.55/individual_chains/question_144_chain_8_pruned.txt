Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a meson resonance called X. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different distances given in meters with exponents of 10^-15 or 10^-16. Hmm.

Alright, so I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime. But wait, how do I connect these given values to find the decay distance? Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I think the mean lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ. Oh right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by the equation Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight. The lifetime is inversely proportional to the decay width. Because a larger width implies a shorter lifetime, since the particle is decaying more quickly. So yeah, tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, what's the correct formula? I think it's Γ = ħ c tau? No, wait. No, the relation is Γ = ħ / tau. Or maybe Γ = ħ * something else. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, let me recall. The total decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So solving for τ gives τ = ħ / Γ. I think that's correct. Because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy multiplied by time. So when you divide ħ by Γ, you get time. Makes sense.

Once we have the lifetime τ, we can find the decay distance. But how? Well, the decay distance depends on the velocity of the particle and the lifetime. The formula is something like c multiplied by τ multiplied by the velocity. But wait, if the particle is moving relativistically, we might need to consider its velocity.

Wait, but wait. The particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV, and its mass m is 1.2 GeV. So we can find its velocity by calculating its gamma factor. Gamma is E/(m c²). Wait, but since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², maybe the units will work out if we handle them carefully.

Let me think. The energy E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, when E is given in GeV and mass in GeV/c², the units might cancel. Let me compute gamma. So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8/(1.2) = 6.666..., approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667. Now, the velocity beta (β) can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The relation is gamma =
