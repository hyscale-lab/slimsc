Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has an atomic number of 3, so the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, Li has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's Li-6, which is the stable isotope. So the mass number A is 6.

So, each Li-6 nucleus has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But to get the actual mass in kilograms, I need to convert that. One atomic mass unit is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u would be 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.66e-27 is 9.963234e-27 kg. Wait, more accurately, 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 is 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Now, the speed v is 0.96c. So I can plug this into the gamma equation.
