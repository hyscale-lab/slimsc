Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Then, I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what the state |alpha> actually is. It's given as proportional to that expression, so I'll have to normalize it.

Wait, the state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let's compute their magnitudes.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2). And the magnitude of (2 - i) is sqrt(2² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5).

So the normalization factor is sqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(5))^2 ) = sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but wait, the question said it's proportional. So that's the normalized form. Got it.

Next, the operator whose matrix has elements A_ij. Let me think about what this operator looks like. The matrix is 2x2 since the basis is |up> and |down>.

So for a 2x2 matrix, A_ij is ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix would look like:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, that's a spin operator in the x-direction? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so scaling it by ħ/2 would make
