Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius, so just a bit above freezing. 

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's heavier isotope is incorporated. So, maybe X is a metal or something that has isotopes.

Let's break this down piece by piece.

First, the reaction of X with Y gives gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has the same number of n and p. That could mean it's a noble gas because noble gases are monatomic or maybe another diatomic gas. Let's think: known gases with equal n and p. The atoms would have the same number of protons and neutrons, so for a noble gas, like He (2 protons, 2 neutrons), that fits because 2n=2p. Or maybe something like O2? Wait, no, O's atomic number is 8, so each O atom has 8 protons. The number of neutrons would be 8 (since for O-16, it's 8 neutrons), so O2 would have 16 p and 16 n. So each molecule would have 16 each. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 is a molecule, but I think the question says the gas's molecule has same n and p per molecule. Wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons," so per molecule, not per atom. Hmm.

Wait, let's think of simple gases. Let's think of H2. Each H has 1 p and about 0.989 neutron on average, but that's not exact. Or maybe H2O. No, because H2O is a liquid under standard conditions. Wait, but Y is a liquid, so maybe Y is water? Or another liquid.

Alternatively, maybe gas W is CO2. Let's see: Carbon has 6 protons. Each CO2 molecule
