Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same minimum masses, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. Wait, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh, but same radii, so that's interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. We need to figure out which one is more likely to transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet), where a_planet is the semi-major axis, but wait, more accurately, it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so the term becomes 1. So the probability simplifies to R_star / a_planet.

Wait, no, correction. I think the transit probability is actually given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so
