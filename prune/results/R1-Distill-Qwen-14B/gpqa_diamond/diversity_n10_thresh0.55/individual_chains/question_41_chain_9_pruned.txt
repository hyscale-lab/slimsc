Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when things move relative to each other, especially at significant speeds, you have to consider relativity. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's just a case of relative motion and not needing full relativity. Or does it?

The question says a light beam is propagating through the glass, which has an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. I think about the speed of light in different media. Normally, the speed of light in a medium with index n is c/n. But here, the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So the observer is in the lab, which is the stationary frame. The glass is moving with velocity v towards them.

So, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, how does that affect the speed of light observed in that medium? I think this is a problem that involves the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Oh right, because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but the glass is moving, which is the medium where the light is propagating. So if the medium is moving, would that affect how the light's speed is measured in the lab frame?

I remember the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, this applies when you're changing frames. So the light's speed in the glass is c/n, but in the lab frame, the glass
