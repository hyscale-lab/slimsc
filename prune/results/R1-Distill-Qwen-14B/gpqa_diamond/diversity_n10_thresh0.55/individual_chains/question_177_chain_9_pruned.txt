Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again and see what it's asking.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, same scaling for both radius and mass. But wait, I guess mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about luminosity, which depends more on radius and temperature, right?

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. So, if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because if lambda_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, that's crucial. So T1 = T2. Because lambda_max is same for both. So temperature is a factor here.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity probably affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but in this case, since the question is about their intrinsic luminosities, I think the radial velocities might not affect the calculation, unless we're considering their actual emission. Wait, but luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so perhaps the velocities are a red herring here. Or maybe they're used to determine some other factor, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem says that astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the question is about the ratio L1/L2.

Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both are blackbodies, this formula applies. And since we're told to assume they radiate as black bodies, we can use this.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴, L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

We know R1 is 1.5 R2. And we found earlier that T1 = T2, because the peak wavelengths are the same.

So substituting, T1 = T2 = T.

So L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴ = 4π R2² σ T⁴ * (1.5)^2.

Similarly, L2 = 4π R2² σ T^4. 

So the ratio L1/L2 is (1.5)^2, right? Because all the other factors are the same.

Wait, but wait a second. Because (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the ratio is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, the options are A is ~2.25, B is ~2.32,
