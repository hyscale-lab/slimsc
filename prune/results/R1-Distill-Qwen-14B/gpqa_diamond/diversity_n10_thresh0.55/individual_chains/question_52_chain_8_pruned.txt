Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So, the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not spotted, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but what's the effect on the photosphere when there are spots?

So, when spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler. But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. And we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of (−ΔE / kT), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(− (E2 − E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels.

Wait, but here, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio goes down. Because as T goes down, the exponential term becomes smaller. So if the spots cause the overall temperature to drop, the ratio (n2/n1) would decrease.

But wait, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. We need to find the factor by which it changes. Like, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that would be in the near ultraviolet or far UV. But I'm not sure if that's needed
