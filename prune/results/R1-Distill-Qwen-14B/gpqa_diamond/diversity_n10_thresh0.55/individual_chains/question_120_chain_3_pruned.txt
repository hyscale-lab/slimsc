Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of 1 over plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is p = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's think about this. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars in space is constant. So how does this translate into the number we observe for a given parallax range?

I think I should model this. Let's say the number of stars in a certain volume is n. If stars are uniformly distributed, n = density * volume. But how does the volume relate to parallax?

Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. For a small change in p, say from p to p + dp, what's the corresponding distance? It would go from 1/p to 1/(p + dp). Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance shells.

Wait, when we're considering stars at a certain distance, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the surface area of the shell. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². So the number of stars in that shell would be N = 4πd² * (number density) * dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So substituting, N = 4π*(1/p²) * (number density) * (dd).

Wait, but if I'm looking at a small change in parallax, dp, how does that translate to dd? Let's see, d = 1/p. So dd = -1/p² dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases (closer stars), d decreases. But for the purposes of counting, perhaps we can take the absolute value. So the change in d, dd,
