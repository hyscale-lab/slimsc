Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

Alright, the question is about a star that's being observed. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so Rstar is R_sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're at 5000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing the brightness variations that we observe as a light curve. The question states that this situation can resemble an exoplanet transit, so they want to find out what the radius of a hypothetical planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots do.

Hmm, okay. So the problem is basically asking, if instead of spots, there was a planet transiting the star, what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness. So I need to calculate the relative radius of the planet (Rpl/Rstar) such that the signal in the light curve (the dip) is the same amplitude as what the spots cause.

Wait, no. Wait. The question says, to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, assuming the star wasn't covered by spots. So the spot scenario is causing a certain brightness variation, and the planet transit would cause another. But the question is to make the planet's effect match the spot effect.

Wait, no. Wait. The question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude? So it's comparing two scenarios: one where spots cause a brightness dip, and another where a planet causes a dip. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, but the way the question is worded, it says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So the scenario is, if the spots weren't there, what planet would cause the same dip. So the amplitude of the dip due to the planet should equal the amplitude of the dip due to the spots.

So I need to compute the dip caused by the spots and then compute the dip caused by the planet, set them equal, and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Let me think about how each of these contributes to the brightness variation.

First, the spots.
