Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in solution. The concentrations given are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex. Wait no, wait—dithiocyanato would have two SCN ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)_2]²+? Or is it the tetra? Hmm, wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue ones. I remember from my notes that the color of the complex depends on the number of SCN- ions attached.

Wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the monomeric complex [Co(SCN)]+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+), β3 maybe for [Co(SCN)_3]^(3-?), or wait, no, because each SCN is -1, so for each added SCN, the charge changes. Let me think: Co²+ plus n SCN⁻ would have a charge of 2 - n. So for [Co(SCN)_n
