Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it probably forms a complex with calcium ions.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. K is the formation constant, right? So the bigger the K, the more stable the complex.

I think the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So when they form the complex, the calcium and EDTA concentrations are multiplied together in the denominator.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. If the complex dissociates, it would produce Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But given the high K value, the dissociation should be minimal because K is really large, meaning the complex is very stable.

So I can model this as an equilibrium. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-:

CaEDTA^2- â‡Œ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The initial concentrations before dissociation are [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] =
