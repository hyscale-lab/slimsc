Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories are constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, right? And these operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model because SMEFT is just a low-energy approximation.

Wait, so what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. That means all the operators in the theory must respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry, which is option 1, must be respected. So option A includes 1 and 2. But wait, what about Poincare symmetry?

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or do I need to think about this differently. Hmm. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's built in a way that incorporates the symmetries of the original theory. Since the Standard Model includes Poincare symmetry, the SMEFT operators should also respect that. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries (options 1 and 2) are required.

But wait, the question says "must be
