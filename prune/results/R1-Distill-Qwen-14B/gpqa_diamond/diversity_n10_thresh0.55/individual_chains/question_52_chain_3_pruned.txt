Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

The problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii and it's 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So the key here is probably about the Saha equation and how the ionization state changes with temperature. Because when the star has spots, it's cooler, so maybe the ionization balance changes. But wait, the problem is about the ratio of two specific energy levels, not ionization. Oh right, but the Saha equation deals with ionization, but the Boltzmann equation deals with energy level populations.

Wait wait, the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti in two energy levels. So when the star is cooler, how does that affect the population ratio of these levels?

The problem states that the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe visible range. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact wavelength isn't as important as the fact that it's a specific transition.

The star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so we can apply the Boltzmann equation here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula is:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T))

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in levels 2 and 1.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

So the ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on the temperature. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases to
