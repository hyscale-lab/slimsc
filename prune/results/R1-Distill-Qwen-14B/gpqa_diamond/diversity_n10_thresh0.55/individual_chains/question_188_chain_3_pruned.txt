Okay, so I have this crystallography problem in front of me, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right? It's also called the trigonal crystal system sometimes.

The given data is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, no, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms in the lattice. But wait, in a crystal, the lattice constant a is the edge length of the unit cell. Oh wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a in this case? Or is it different? Oh wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to a, the lattice parameter. But in other structures, like close-packed ones, it's different. Wait, but the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps a is 10 Angstrom here.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal. So it's a special case where a = b = c, and angles are all the same.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2) * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - a^2 (h^2 cos^2(alpha) + ... )) / (something). Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for a general crystal.

Oh wait, I think the formula is:

1/d^2 = (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2 hk cos(beta)/(a b) - 2 hl cos(gamma)/(a c) - 2 kl cos(alpha)/(b c)

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So all the a's, b's, c's are the same, and the angles are the same. So substituting that into the formula might simplify things.

So, let me write the formula for a rhombohedral crystal. Let a = b = c = a0. And all angles are theta = 30 degrees here.

So the formula becomes:

1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - [hk cos(theta) + hl cos(theta) + kl cos(theta)]/(a0²)

Because all the terms like cos(beta) etc. are cos(theta), and the denominators for the cross terms are a0^2 because ab = a0^2, etc.

So, the formula becomes:

1/d² = [h² + k² + l² - hk cos(theta) - hl cos(theta) - kl cos(theta)] / a0²

In our case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Substituting h,k,l as 1:

1/d² = [1 +1+1 - (1*1 cos(theta) + 1*1 cos(theta) + 1*1 cos(theta)) ] / a0²

Which simplifies to:

1/d² = [3 - 3 cos(theta)] / a0²

Wait, because each cross term is cos(theta), and there are three of them. So
