Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun, which is good to know because I can maybe compare it to the Sun's properties later if needed. So, half of this star's surface is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Hmm, what does filling factor mean? I think it's the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by these spots. So if it's 20%, then 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered. Wait, but the hemisphere is one side—so does that mean 20% of that hemisphere is spots, or 20% of the entire star? Hmm, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Oh wait, I think the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. So each hemisphere has 20% coverage of spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler because they're dark, right? So the temperature difference is 1000K. So the spots are at 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. Wait, but wait—no, the question says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. Wait, does that mean each spot is 1000K cooler than the surrounding?
