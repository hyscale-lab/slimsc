Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the spectral data given. The IR and NMR data will help me figure out the structure of Compound X before the reaction.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500, which usually indicates either N-H stretching (like in amines) or O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids). But wait, there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is broad, so maybe the 3400-2500 cm-1 is from O-H. Alternatively, if it's an ester or ketone, the O-H might not be present. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 would be the carbonyl. Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical for carboxylic acids.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. This suggests two aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe two substituents on the ring, one at para position.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the other two protons in the aromatic ring. So if the aromatic ring has substituents in para positions, the splitting would be as two doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having two protons each? Wait, no, because if it's para, each substituent would have two protons, but maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. Alternatively, think of a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions—like a substituent
