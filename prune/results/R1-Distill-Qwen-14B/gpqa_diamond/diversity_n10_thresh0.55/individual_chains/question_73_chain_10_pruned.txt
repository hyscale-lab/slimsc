Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. So, I need to figure out the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's break this down.

The problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I think since they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because that's how it would work in classical mechanics. But relativity is different.

Wait, right, in relativity, velocities don't just add or subtract directly. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh yeah, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers.

So, astronaut A is the first one with speed 0.6c, and astronaut B is 0.5c. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I need to clarify which is which. The problem says the first astronaut is 2m moving at 0.6c, and the second is 3m at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

So v_rel would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. Looking at the options, I see options C and D have 0.14c for relative speed.

Now the other part is the total energy of the system. Oh, right, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut (2m, 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0
