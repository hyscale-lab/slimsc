Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking about the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed depends on its amplitude and the spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

So the setup is a mass m attached to a spring obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The maximum amplitude is A. I'm supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

In the classical case, maximum speed is given by v_max = omega * A, where omega is sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's non-relativistic. Relativistically, the equations change because of the gamma factor (Lorentz factor). Oh wait, but how does that affect the oscillator?

I remember that in relativistic mechanics, the equations of motion are more complicated. The force isn't just F = -kx anymore because the mass increases with speed. So the equation of motion would involve gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to approach this using energy conservation. In the relativistic case, the total energy includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but at maximum amplitude x=A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

At maximum speed, the mass is passing through the equilibrium point (x=0), so all the energy is kinetic. But I also need to account for the relativistic expression for kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the problem, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, so the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential, and it's conserved. At x=0, the potential is zero, so the kinetic energy is maximum, which would be E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that's the classical approach. But in relativity, energy isn't just kinetic, so I need to adjust.

Wait, the total energy in relativity is gamma mc². But the potential energy is (1/2)k A², right? So when the mass is at x=A, all energy is potential. When it's at x=0, it's all kinetic. So E (total) = (1/2)kA² + K (kinetic energy). But K is (gamma -1) mc², because the total energy is gamma mc², which equals rest energy plus kinetic.

So E_total = (1/2)kA² + (gamma - 1) mc². But at the point where x=0, the potential is zero, so E_total = K = (gamma -1) mc². Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because E_total should equal the potential at x=A, which is (1/2)kA², and when x=0, all that energy is kinetic.

Wait, wait. Let me write this out clearly. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so the kinetic energy is maximum. So the kinetic energy K_max is E, which is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So setting K_max = (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait. That would mean (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, because solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so let's write that:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, let's call it D. So D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then gamma = 1 + D.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + D.

Let me solve for v. Let me square both sides first:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + D)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + D)^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1+D)^2].

So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1+D)^2).

Since D is (k A²)/(2 m c²), substituting back:

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2).

Wait, let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2 ). Which matches what I have.

Wait, but wait, let me check the other options.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2 m c²)) ), no, that doesn't look right.

Option A: sqrt(1 + ...), that would imply v > c, which is impossible because gamma can't be imaginary. So that's probably not correct.

Wait, but wait, when I derived it, the expression under the sqrt was 1 - 1/(1+D)^2, so option D is correct.

Wait, let me just re-express the equation:

v^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/(1+D)^2] = c^2 [ ( (1+D)^2 -1 ) / (1+D)^2 ) ]

(1+D)^2 is 1 + 2D + D^2. So (1+D)^2 -1 = 2D + D^2.

So v^2 = c^2 [ (2D + D^2) / (1+D)^2 ) ]

= c^2 D (2 + D) / (1+D)^2.

But D is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which for small A, is much less than 1. So when D is very small, v ≈ sqrt( (k A^2)/(2 m) ) * c, which would align with classical expression, but relativistically corrected.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is sqrt(kA²/m). Which is the classical maximum speed (since v = omega A, and omega is sqrt(k/m), so v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A, which is sqrt(k A^2/m).

So option C is the classical answer. But we're in a relativistic scenario, so option C is probably not correct.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy approach. So potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)k A². At x=0, all that energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but is the potential energy in the relativistic case still (1/2)k A²?

Hmm, that's a good point. In relativity, the expression for potential energy in a harmonic oscillator might not be the same as in the classical case. Oh wait, but the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential energy would still be (1/2) k x², same as classical.

So the approach should be correct.

Wait, but another approach is to look for the equation of motion. The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is more complicated, but perhaps we can write it down.

The force is F = -k x. In relativistic mechanics, F = d(momentum)/dt. Momentum is gamma m v.

So F = d/dt [ gamma m v ].

So F = m d/dt [ gamma v ].

But wait, F is given as -k x.

So -k x = m d/dt (gamma v).

Hmm, but solving this differential equation might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use energy conservation.

Wait, but I think I did the energy approach correctly, so the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), spring constant \( k \), and maximum amplitude \( A \), we use energy conservation. The total mechanical energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and is equal to the potential energy at maximum amplitude \( x = A \), which is \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + D.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + D)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}.
\]

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + D)^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( D = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** suggest \( v > c \), which is impossible as no object can exceed the speed of light.
- **Option C** is the classical expression for maximum speed and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
