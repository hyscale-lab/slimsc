Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The compound X has specific IR and NMR data.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But the broadness might suggest an O-H group because N-H is often sharper. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The other peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest possible aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound might have a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. The broadness suggests it's exchanging, which fits a carboxylic acid. But if it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9.5-10.5, but aldehyde protons are usually less broad. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Could it be a phenolic OH? Phenols usually show up around 5-7 ppm, but maybe if it's more acidic, like in a strongly activated ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone or ester. Wait, no, the aldehyde is more likely. Or maybe it is a carboxylic acid. Let me hold that thought.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest two sets of protons, each with two equivalent Hs. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene or something similar, but with substituents. The higher shift (8.0) might be due to electron-withdrawing groups, while the lower (7.2) could be due to electron-donating groups.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a CH group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Like a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or part of a substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons as a multiplet around 1.7. Maybe part of a CH₂ group connected to another CH or something.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three Hs as a doublet. A doublet for a CH₃ group attached to a CH₂ or maybe a CH that's next to another CH. Like in an isopropyl group or something.
