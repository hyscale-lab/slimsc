Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. 

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional. Proportional usually means it hasn't been normalized yet, so we can't proceed until we do that.

So, |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2 - i)|down>, where 'a' is the proportionality constant. Wait, no, actually, the state is already given as proportional, so I think I just need to find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. 

Calculating the inner product: 

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 -i). So their moduli squared are (1^2 +1^2) = 2 for the first term, and (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5 for the second. But wait, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you have (2 - i), the complex conjugate is (2 + i), so the modulus squared is (2)^2 + (1)^2 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7, but wait, because the state is a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2 -i)|down>, so the inner product is a^2*(|1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2) )= a^2*(2 +5) = 7a². So for normalization, 7a² =1. So a²=1/7, so a=1/sqrt(7). 

So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator's matrix is given. The operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 when i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero because i=j would give zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So matrix A looks like:

[ 0        hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0     ]

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in the x or y direction is usually a Pauli matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Like, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply by hbar/2, that's exactly operator A. So this operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

Wait, but the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenstates of operator A are the same as the standard spin-x eigenstates.

Wait, but the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of operator A. So, I need to find the probability of the electron being in each of these eigenstates when measured.

So, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of S_z (z-component of spin). The operator A's eigenstates are different, so to find the probability, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Alternatively, perhaps directly compute the probabilities by projecting |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Wait, but let's think about it. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix, so it has two eigenstates. Let me find them. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The matrix A is:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.
So,
| -λ    hbar/2       |
| hbar/2   -λ         |  = 0
=> λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0
So λ = ± hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for λ = hbar/2 are found by solving (A - (hbar/2) I)|v> =0.

So the equations become:
- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0
=> v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1), so |+x> is
