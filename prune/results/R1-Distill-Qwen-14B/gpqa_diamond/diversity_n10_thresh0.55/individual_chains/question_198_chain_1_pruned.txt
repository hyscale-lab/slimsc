Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that. But what's the structure of the complexes? I think the possible complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) where n varies. The stability constants are given for each step, so I need to consider how they form.

Stability constants (β) are for each step of complex formation. So β1 is for Co(SCN)^(+) maybe? Because each β is for adding another SCN-.

Wait, the general formula for a stepwise stability constant is:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+)] / ([Co(SCN)_(n-1)^(2-(n-1)+)] [SCN^-])

So β1 would be for the first ligand: Co(SCN)^(+) from Co^2+ and SCN^-.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the overall complex with n SCN- would have a formation constant K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So the overall formation constant K3 would be β1*β2*β3, for Co(SCN)_3^(−), right? And K4 would be β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but wait, β4 is 16. So for the fourth complex, the overall K is the product of all four βs. But how many ligands does each complex have?

Wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n). So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → charge is +1. n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0
