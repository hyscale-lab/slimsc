Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using some spectroscopy data. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

Alright, the data given is from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each part.

First, the FTIR. A very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Alcohol, maybe? Or possibly a carboxylic acid, but those are usually even broader and maybe a bit lower. Hmm. Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, but sometimes it could be an aromatic ring or something else. Or perhaps it's an conjugated carbonyl group? Like maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated something. Wait, if there's a peak at 1650, that might be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or an acid. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but that usually has peaks around 1500 or so. Hmm, not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has an alkene group. So that's a clue towards the structure.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. M/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about what fragments have a mass of 45. One possibility is a fragment with a methyl group and an oxygen. Wait, 45 is C3H7O? Let me calculate: C3H7O would be (3*12) +7 +16 = 36+7+16=60? That's not right. Wait, maybe it's a different combination. Oh, another possibility is a CH3O group. Wait, no, that would be 31. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be (CH2)2O, but (CH2)2O is C2H4O
