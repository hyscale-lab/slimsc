Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral crystals?

Rhombohedral, right. It's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are each 30 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no: in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are equal, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, wait, no. No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in a rhombohedral system (also called trigonal), all edges are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal (α = β = γ). So in this question, yes, the angles are all 30 degrees each. Got it.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice parameter a? Because in a cubic system, for example, the interatomic distance would be 'a', the lattice constant. So I think in a rhombohedral system, the lattice constant 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance. So a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal structure. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by
