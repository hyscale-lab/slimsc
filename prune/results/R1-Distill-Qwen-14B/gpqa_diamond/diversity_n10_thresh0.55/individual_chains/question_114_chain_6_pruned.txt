Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. I'll need to think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, that's usually a nucleophilic substitution maybe. But wait, ketones can undergo various reactions with nitriles. Oh, right! There's the Stephen reduction or something else... but wait, NaCN is a nucleophile, so maybe it's an addition reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one has a carbonyl group. Adding CN- would be nucleophilic addition. So the product after adding HCN would be a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, making a cyanohydrin. So the general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, I think. Let me draw this.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would add across the carbonyl: the O becomes OH, and the CN adds to the adjacent carbon. So the product would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That makes sense. So the reagents for this
