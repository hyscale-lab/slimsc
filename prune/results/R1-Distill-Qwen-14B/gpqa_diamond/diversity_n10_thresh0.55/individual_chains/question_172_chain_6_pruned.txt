Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such problems, it's all about understanding how the excitation of atoms relates to temperature in a stellar atmosphere under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor determines the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels being equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the excitation here is the population ratio. Let me denote the two energy levels as level E1 and E2, but wait, the problem is about the same energy level in two different stars. Oh wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the ratio of the excitation (or the population) is given as N1/N2 = 2.

Wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e
