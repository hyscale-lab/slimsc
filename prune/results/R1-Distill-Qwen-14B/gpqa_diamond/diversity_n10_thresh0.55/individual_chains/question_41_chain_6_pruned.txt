Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of the light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, with B being 1, which I know is the speed of light in a vacuum. The others are fractions with different combinations of n and v.

Wait, so the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. I remember something about the speed of light in a medium being c divided by the refractive index, right? So normally, the speed of light in the glass would be v = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So I think this is a situation where I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, but wait, that's when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But the problem just says v, which I don't know if it's a small or large value.

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So c is 1 in these units. So the speed of light in the glass, if it weren't moving, would be 1/n. But now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Hmm, I think about relative velocity. If the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed in the lab might change. Let
