Okay, I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is: a light beam is moving through glass with refractive index n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. The question is asking what the speed of the light is relative to the lab frame (observer).

Wait, I remember that in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum, right? What about in a medium like glass? Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer.

But here, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

Hmm, let me think. Maybe I should consider the frame transformations. So the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light is moving through the glass
