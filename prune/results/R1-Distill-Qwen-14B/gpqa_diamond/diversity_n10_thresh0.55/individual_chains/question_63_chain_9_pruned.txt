Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait. I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching. But wait, the problem says it's a diatomic molecule in its fundamental state. Fundamental state... that's the lowest energy state, right?

So the molecule is in its ground state, and a photon is absorbed, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, what does that mean? The next state would probably be the first excited state. But I need to figure out what part changes—rotation, vibration, or both?

Wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) with the lowest rotational state (like J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to a higher energy state. But what's the next lowest possible energy state? That would probably involve either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, the problem is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the two states. But which transition is it?

Let me think about the energy levels. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. The ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1 (vibrational excited state) or J=1 (rotational excited state). Which transition requires less energy? Well, the vibrational energy levels are generally higher in spacing than rotational ones, but that depends on the specific molecule.

Wait, but I'm given the angular frequency w for vibration, which is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the photon's momentum. Momentum p is related to energy E via E = p²/(2m), but wait, for a photon, E = pc, because photons have no mass. Oh, right! For a photon, E = pc, where p is momentum. So if I can find the energy of the photon needed for the transition, I can find p.

But what transition are we talking about? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which for the quantum rotation-vibration model is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state
