Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases gas B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Then, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's start by identifying the substances. The reaction is violent and releases a gas. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait! If the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, what could that be? Well, water is H2O, but that's not a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe it's something like CO2? No, that's a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Wait, perhaps it's a noble gas. Let me think. Oh! If W is a noble gas, like helium (He), but He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in some isotopes. But wait, noble gases have a specific number of electrons. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think: for example, O2 has 8 protons each, so 16 total in the molecule. If each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, then the molecule would have 32 neutrons and 16 protons. No, that's not equal. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, which would be deuterium (D or Â²H). But as a gas, maybe it's H2, but H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if they're deuterium). Wait, but that's maybe a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's CO, but that's a gas too. Alternatively, perhaps W is NH3, but ammonia isn't a gas with equal protons and neutrons. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about W again. The molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of a molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. For example, maybe CH4: each C has
