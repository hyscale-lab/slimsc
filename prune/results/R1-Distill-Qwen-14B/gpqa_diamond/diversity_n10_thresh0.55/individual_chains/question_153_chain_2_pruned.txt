Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products in each of the three given reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction (A) is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a strong, enolizable carbonyl compound. The other reactant is an enolate, I think. Wait, no, the enolate is usually the nucleophile. Oh wait, in the Michael reaction, the enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So, the nucleophile is the enolate from dimethyl malonate, and the Michael acceptor is the acrylate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate can form its enolate. So in the presence of a base like NaOEt, the malonate would deprotonate to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2=CH-C-O-Me, but wait, the E configuration. So the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group (which is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring) on one end and the ester group on the other.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part of the acrylate), it adds across the double bond. The product would then have the malonate's group attached to the acrylate's structure.

Wait, the starting acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me, but wait, no. Let me get this right. The formula is CH2=CH-C(O)OMe, but with the p-tolyl group attached to the double bond. Wait, no, wait. The formula is CH2-C=CH-O-Me? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. So the
