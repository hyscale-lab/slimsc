Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out. The question involves identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 â†’ (18-10)/2 = 4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and maybe an amine or something else. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm as a triplet (1H), that's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So there's an aldehyde group somewhere.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each integrating to two protons, so maybe a substituted benzene with two substituents in the para position. Or maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in positions that cause these doublets.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, two protons. Maybe these are from another aromatic ring that's attached in some way, but perhaps with substituents that cause the protons to be split, but it's a broad signal, maybe due to coupling with multiple protons or being in a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) seems like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative. Could be adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. The doublet suggests coupling with another CH2, so maybe a -CH2-CH2- group where each is next to each other and attached to something else.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, an aldehyde group, and a CH2 group connected in a way that forms a conjugated system.

Wait, the aldehyde is at around 9.72, so the molecule probably has a structure where there's an aldehyde (RCHO) group, perhaps connected to a chain. The 3.66 ppm for CH2 could be part of a chain attached to the aldehyde.

Let me think about the possible structure. Since the molecular formula is C8H9NO, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one N, and one O. The aldehyde group contributes O and one N? Hmm, but the formula has one N. So maybe the N is part of an amine group or an amide, but looking at the NMR, I don't see any peaks that suggest amines. The triplet at 9.72 is more like an aldehyde. So where's the N?

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde part and another substituent. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with substituents that include an aldehyde and a nitro group or something else.

Wait, the NMR data has 9.72 (t, 1H), which is an aldehyde. Then, the aromatic signals suggest two substituents on the benzene. The 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be from a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, each with para positions, which are causing those doublets. Let me imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Each substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR also shows 6.27 (bs, 2H
