Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, so this looks like a Yukawa interaction, which is typical for fermions coupling to a scalar boson. The v is probably the vacuum expectation value, but maybe that's not too important for this problem.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion pairs the X can decay into.

At lowest order, the decay would be via tree-level Feynman diagrams. For a boson like this, the decay products would be a fermion-antifermion pair. So X can decay into ff̄ where f is a fermion.

The key here is figuring out which fermions have a mass less than half of X's mass. Because in any decay, the rest mass of the parent must be at least twice the mass of each decay product. So the maximum mass each fermion can have is 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's remember the approximate masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV. So that's allowed.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV. Also allowed.
- Tau (τ): around 1.77 GeV. Allowed.
- Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t).
Wait, top quark is about 173 GeV, way too heavy. Similarly, bottom is around 4.7 GeV. Oh wait, 4.7 is above 3 GeV? Hmm, 4.7 is more than 3, so that's not allowed. So b quark is out. How about charm? Charm is about 1.5 GeV. So that's allowed.

What about the others? Up quark is like 2 MeV, so way under. Down is about 4-5 MeV, also way under. Strange is around 100 MeV or so, which is way under 3 GeV. So s quark is allowed.

So the fermions that can be produced are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. 

Wait, but in the options, the fermions are given as pairs, like b bbar, s sbar, etc.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
But wait, the b quark is about 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So when X is 6 GeV, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. So b quark is too heavy. So any decay into b quarks is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
So the fermions here are c (1.5 GeV), s (~100 MeV), u, d, tau (1.77 GeV), mu (0.1 GeV), e. All these are under 3 GeV. So this looks possible. Wait but what about the c quark? 1.5 <3, so yes. So option B is possible.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Wait, top quark is 173 GeV. Way too heavy. So X can't decay to top quarks.
