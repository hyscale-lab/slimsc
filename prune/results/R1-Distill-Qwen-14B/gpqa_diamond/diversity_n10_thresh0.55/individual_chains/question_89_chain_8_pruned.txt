Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has this really rigid structure, kind of like a diamond lattice. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on two of the carbons in the structure, probably adjacent positions in the adamantane framework.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I think when dibromides react with bases, it's an elimination reaction, probably E2. So two bromines would lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a fused ring system, eliminating two bromides would create a double bond between the two carbons where the bromines were attached. So the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid—maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, because KOH could also cause an epoxidation if there's an adjacent diol, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe elimination of HBr from each Br, leading to a diene. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a double bond. So the product after KOH would be a diene, but wait
