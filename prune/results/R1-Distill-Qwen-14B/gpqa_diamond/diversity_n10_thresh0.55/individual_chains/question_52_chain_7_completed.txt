Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So, the key point is probably about how the presence of spots affects the temperature of the photosphere, which in turn affects the ionization states of the atoms and their energy level populations.

Wait, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can assume that each region is at its own temperature and behaves according to the Boltzmann equation for energy levels.

Let me think. The star has two regions: the spotted areas and the unspotted areas. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, those spots are presumably cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, the effective temperature of the entire star decreases because the average of the surface areas' temperatures is lower.

But wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the star as a whole is being considered at 5500 K when spots are present. But what's the actual temperature of the spots versus the unspotted areas?

Wait, maybe that's not needed. Because the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio depends on the temperature. But wait, in the star without spots, the entire photosphere is at 6000 K. When spots are present, 60% of the surface is at 6000 K? Or maybe the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest is higher? Or perhaps when spots are present, the average temperature is 5500 K, but the actual photosphere is a mix of cooler and hotter regions? Or is the photosphere as a whole considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present?

Wait, the question says when the surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average Teff is lower. So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but I'm not sure if the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Alternatively, maybe the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, but the net effect is an average.

But how does this affect the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels?

Wait, I think the problem is considering the photosphere as a single blackbody when computing the effective temperature, but when looking at the detailed spectrum (like the ratio of Ti lines), each region contributes according to its own temperature.

Wait, but the question states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Hmm. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. Maybe the spots are cooler, and the rest is at 6000 K. So, the ratio would depend on the areas and their temperatures.

But alternatively, perhaps when considering the star as a whole, the photosphere has spots that are cooler, so the average flux is lower. However, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So, the star's overall luminosity changes. But how does that affect the spectral lines?

Wait, the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature of the region where that line is formed. If the star has spots, then the observed transition (like from level 1 to level 2) might come from both the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the problem says, "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio... this ratio decreases when the star has spots." So, perhaps the ratio is measured as an average over the entire surface, considering the area with different temperatures.

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. I think that's in the near-ultraviolet range. Titanium lines are often used as temperature indicators in stellar atmospheres.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2-E1 is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. So, if the temperature changes, the ratio changes.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So, each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature, but the total observed ratio is an average of the two regions' contributions.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K, but that seems unlikely because spots are cooler regions. Alternatively, the problem might be simplifying things by taking the average temperature as 5500 K.

Wait, but maybe the star's photosphere is a mix of temperatures. Let me think; when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the rest (60%) is at T_normal =6000 K.

The total luminosity (which relates to the effective temperature) would then be L = L_spot * 0.4 + L_normal * 0.6.

But L is proportional to T^4 times the area. So,

L = 0.4 * (T_spot)^4 * (R^2 / R_sun^2) * sigma + 0.6 * (6000^4) * (R^2 / R_sun^2) * sigma

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute the effective temperature.

The effective temperature (Teff) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R^2 sigma Teff^4.

So when the star has spots, the total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted area and the unspotted area.

Let me denote the unspotted temperature as T1 = 6000 K (covering 60% of the surface), the spotted temperature as T2 (covering 40% of the surface), and the overall Teff as T_eff =5500 K.

The total luminosity would be:

L = (0.6 * A * sigma * T1^4) + (0.4 * A * sigma * T2^4)

Where A is the total surface area of the star. Since L is also equal to 4π R^2 sigma Teff^4,

4π R^2 sigma Teff^4 = A (0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4) sigma.

But wait, A is the surface area, which is 4π R^2. So,

4π R^2 sigma Teff^4 = (4π R^2) * (0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4) sigma.

We can cancel out 4π R^2 sigma from both sides:

Teff^4 = 0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4.

So,

Teff^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T2)^4.

We know Teff is 5500 K.

So,

5500^4 = 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T2^4)

Let me compute each term numerically.

First, compute 5500^4.

5500 = 5.5e3.

(5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12 = 91506.25 * 1e12 = 9.150625e16.

Wait, let me compute 5.5^4:

5.5^2 = 30.25

5.5^4 = (30.25)^2 = approximately 915.0625.

So, 5.5e3)^4 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me think: (1e3)^4 is 1e12. So 5.5e3 is 5500, so (5500)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

9.150625e14 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 + 0.4 * (T2)^4.

Let me compute 0.6 * 1.296e15.

0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So,

9.150625e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4 * T2^4.

Subtracting,

(9.150625e14 - 7.776e14) = 0.4 * T2^4.

1.374625e14 = 0.4 * T2^4.

So,

T2^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root to find T2.

T2 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

First, take the square root twice.

sqrt(3.4365625e14) = sqrt(3.4365625) * 1e7 ≈ 1.8538 * 1e7 = 1.8538e7.

Then sqrt(1.8538e7) = sqrt(1.8538) * 1e3.5.

Wait, 1e3.5 is 3.1623e3, because 10^3.5 = sqrt(10^7) = sqrt(10,000,000) ≈ 3162.3.

So sqrt(1.8538e7) ≈ sqrt(1.8538) * 3.1623e3.

sqrt(1.8538) is approx 1.3615.

So,

1.3615 * 3.1623e3 ≈ 4.315e3.

So T2 is approximately 4315 K.

Hmm, that seems a bit low for a star spot, but I think it's possible. Oh well, maybe the calculation is correct.

So, when the star has spots, 40% of the surface is at 4315 K, and 60% is at 6000 K.

Now, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio when the star has spots is lower than when it doesn't. The ratio without spots is when the entire photosphere is at 6000 K. When the spots are present, the average ratio decreases.

Wait, but how is the ratio measured? Because the transition line is formed in the photosphere, which is a mix of temperatures. So the observed line strength would be an average of the contributions from the different temperature regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each region in LTE, and the ratio is the average of the ratios from each region, weighted by their areas and the line's contribution.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star is spotless (Teff=6000 K), the ratio is higher. But when the star has spots, the effective Teff is 5500 K, but the photosphere is a mix of 6000 K and 4315 K.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on whether to model each region separately and then compute the ratio as an average, or whether to compute it based on the average temperature. Because the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, but the presence of spots changes the temperature distribution.

Wait, but in the case of the entire surface being 6000 K, the ratio would be based on that temperature. When 40% of the surface is cooler (4315 K), the overall average ratio is a combination of the two.

Wait, but the ratio depends on the temperature of the region in which the line is formed. So, the observed equivalent width of the line (or the ratio of the number of atoms in each level) would be a combination of the contributions from the two regions.

But how do we calculate that? Each region emits according to its own temperature, so the line strength from each region would depend on the Boltzmann factor for that temperature.

But perhaps the observed ratio is the area-weighted average of the ratios from each region.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, for each region (spot and non-spot), we can compute this ratio, and then the observed ratio is the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their areas.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote:

- For the non-spots (60% of surface, T1=6000 K), the ratio is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

- For the spots (40% of surface, T2=4315 K), the ratio is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, in reality, the transition is an electronic transition, so the energy levels are from Ti neutral. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming that g2/g1 is the same for both regions (since it's the same element and same energy levels), the ratio for each region is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

The observed ratio R_obs would be a flux-weighted average of R1 and R2, but since the problem is about the number of atoms, perhaps it's an area-weighted average, since each region contributes according to its area.

Wait, but the number of atoms contributing to the line would depend on the surface area and the emission from each region. So, the total number in level 2 and 1 would be the sum from each region.

But the ratio is n2/n1 overall, which would be (n2_total)/(n1_total) = [n2_1 * A1 + n2_2 * A2 ] / [n1_1 * A1 + n1_2 * A2 ]

Where A1 is 0.6 A and A2 is 0.4 A, with A being the total area.

But n2_1 = R1 * n1_1, since R1 = n2_1/n1_1.

Similarly, n2_2 = R2 * n1_2.

So,

n2_total = R1 n1_1 A1 + R2 n1_2 A2.

n1_total = n1_1 A1 + n1_2 A2.

The ratio is:

R_obs = [ R1 n1_1 A1 + R2 n1_2 A2 ] / [n1_1 A1 + n1_2 A2 ]

But n1_1 and n1_2 are the populations in level 1 for each region, which themselves depend on the temperature.

Wait, but the total number of Ti atoms in each region would be n1 + n2, but since the ratio R is n2/n1, perhaps it's better to normalize.

Alternatively, perhaps each region contributes in proportion to its area and the ratio in that region.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is simply the area-weighted average of the two ratios R1 and R2.

So,

R_obs = (0.6 * R1) + (0.4 * R2).

Because each area contributes to the ratio according to their proportion.

So, with R1 = (g2/g1) exp (-ΔE/(k T1)),

and R2 = (g2/g1) exp (-ΔE/(k T2)),

then,

R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So,

R_obs (spots) = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

When the star has no spots, the entire surface is at T1=6000 K, so R_no_spots = R1.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_obs.

So, the factor is R1 / [ 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2 ].

So,

Factor = R1 / [ 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2 ]

But R1 and R2 are functions of T1 and T2.

Let me compute R1 and R2.

We can write R = exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) ) * (g2/g1).

Wait, but since (g2/g1) is a constant factor for both R1 and R2, the ratio R1/R2 would have (g2/g1) cancel out.

So, R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But for the purpose of computing the factor, which is R1 / [0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2], let's write it in terms of R1 and R2.

Factor = 1 / [0.6 + 0.4 (R2/R1) ]

= 1 / [0.6 + 0.4 exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1) ) ]

But we don't know ΔE. Hmm.

Wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is about 144.8 nm. So, this is in the near-ultraviolet range.

The energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the wavelength.

ΔE = hc / lambda.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), lambda is 1448e-9 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-9)

= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7)

≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But to convert to Kelvin terms, since k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 9.956e4 ≈ 99,560 K.

So, about 1e5 K.

So,

ΔE/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So, now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) in units of 1/K.

T1 = 6000 K, T2=4315 K.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4,

1/T2 = 1/4315 ≈ 2.318e-4.

So,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (2.318e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 6.513e-5.

So,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ≈ 1e5 * 6.513e-5 = 6.513.

So,

exponential factor is exp(6.513) ≈ e^6.513.

e^6 is about 403.429,

e^0.513 is about 1.669,

so e^6.513 ≈ 403.429 * 1.669 ≈ 672.2.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 6.513 can be written as 6 + 0.513.

e^6 = 403.4288.

e^0.513: Let's compute 0.513.

We know that ln(1.669) ≈ 0.512, so e^0.513 ≈ 1.669.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, using Taylor series or calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, using a calculator, e^6.513 ≈ 671.8.

So, exp(6.513) ≈ 671.8.

So, R2/R1 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = exp(6.513) ≈ 671.8.

So, R2 is about 671.8 times smaller than R1.

Wait, because R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so when T decreases, R increases. Because as T decreases, the exponential increases. Because T is in the denominator, so lower T makes the exponent more positive, so exp(-x) is bigger when x is smaller.

Wait, wait, let me double-check.

R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

If T decreases (from T1 to T2, which is lower), then ΔE/(k T) increases, so the exponent becomes more negative. So R would be smaller.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, let's see: For R1, when T is higher (6000 K), the exponent is -ΔE/(k T1) = -(1e5 K)/6000 K ≈ -16.583.

So, exp(-16.583) ≈ 1.3e-7.

For R2, T is lower (4315 K), so exponent is -ΔE/(k T2) = -(1e5)/4315 ≈ -23.175.

exp(-23.175) ≈ 1.2e-10.

Wait, so R2 is smaller than R1. Because when T decreases, R goes down. So R2 = R1 * exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, sorry, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign earlier.

Wait, R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

R2/R1 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) + ΔE/(k T1) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) ] )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So, plugging in the numbers:

ΔE/k ≈ 1e5 K,

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = (1.6667e-4 - 2.318e-4) = -6.513e-5.

So,

(ΔE/k) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = 1e5 * (-6.513e-5) ) = -6.513.

So,

R2/R1 = exp( -6.513 ) ≈ e^(-6.513) ≈ 1/ e^(6.513) ≈ 1/671.8 ≈ 0.001489.

So, R2 is about 0.0015 times R1.

So, approximately, R2 is about 0.15% of R1.

So, when the star has spots, the ratio R_obs is 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

Substituting R2 = 0.0015 R1,

R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * 0.0015 R1 = (0.6 + 0.0006) R1 = 0.6006 R1.

So, R_obs ≈ 0.6006 R1.

So, the factor by which the ratio changes is R_no_spots / R_obs = R1 / (0.6006 R1) ≈ 1 / 0.6006 ≈ 1.665.

Wait, but that's only about 1.66, which is not one of the options. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, that's not matching. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's re-examine the calculations.

First, in the calculation of ΔE/(k):

Earlier, I approximated ΔE/(k) as about 1e5 K.

But let me compute it precisely.

ΔE = hc / lambda.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s,

c = 299792458 m/s,

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (1.448e-7)

Compute numerator: 6.62607e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J m.

Wait, exact calculation:

6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

Let me compute 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8

= 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 * 1e-34+8

= 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ 19.8646 (since 6*3=18, 0.62607 *3=1.878, so around 19.8646)

so 19.8646e-26 = 1.98646e-25 J m.

Divide by lambda = 1.448e-7 m:

ΔE = 1.98646e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ (1.98646 / 1.448 )e-18 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Now, k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18) / (1.380649e-23 ) ≈ (1.372 / 1.380649 )e5 ≈ approx (0.994) * 1e5 ≈ 99400 K.

So, approximately 99400 K.

So, ΔE/(k) ≈ 99400 K.

Earlier, I used 1e5 K, which is a close approximation.

Now, compute (1/T1 - 1/T2):

T1 is 6000 K,

T2 is 4315 K.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 1.6666667e-4,

1/T2 = 1/4315 ≈ 2.3181e-4.

So,

(1/T1 - 1/T2) = 1.6666667e-4 - 2.3181e-4 = -6.514333e-5.

So,

(ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = 99400 * (-6.514333e-5) = 

Compute 99400 * (-6.514333e-5):

99400 * 6.514333e-5 = (99400 * 6.514333) * 1e-5.

99400 * 6.514333 ≈ 99400 *6 = 596,400; 99400 *0.514333≈ approx 50,990. So total ≈ 647,390.

Multiply by 1e-5: 647,390e-5 = 6.4739.

So, the product is approx -6.4739.

So,

exp( -6.4739 ) ≈ ?

We know that e^6.4739 ≈ e^6 = 403.4288; e^0.4739 ≈ 1.606.

So, e^6.4739 ≈ 403.4288 * 1.606 ≈ 647.6.

So, exp(-6.4739) ≈ 1 / 647.6 ≈ 0.001544.

So,

R2/R1 = 0.001544.

So, R2 = R1 * 0.001544.

Now, the observed ratio R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

Substituting R2,

R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * 0.001544 R1 = 0.6 R1 + 0.0006176 R1 = 0.6006176 R1.

So,

Factor = R1 / R_obs = R1 / (0.6006176 R1 ) ≈ 1 / 0.6006176 ≈ 1.665.

So, approximately 1.665 times.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~1.1, which is not close, or option D) ~2.9, which is higher.

Hmm, that's a problem because my calculation gives a factor of about 1.66, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the assumption that R_obs is the area-weighted average is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: when the star is spotless, all the photosphere is at Teff=6000 K. So, the ratio is R1.

When the star has spots, the photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But perhaps the photosphere is now at 5500 K, so the ratio is R_5500.

So, the ratio changes from R1 (6000 K) to R_5500 (5500 K).

So, the factor is R1 / R_5500.

So, I should compute R1 and R_5500.

Let's compute that.

Compute R1 and R_5500.

R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

R1 = exp( -99400 / 6000 )

= exp( -16.5667 )

≈ 1.3e-7.

R_5500 = exp( -99400 / 5500 )

= exp( -18.0727 )

≈ 1.43e-8.

So, the ratio R1/R_5500 is (1.3e-7) / (1.43e-8 ) ≈ 9.09.

So, the factor is about 9.09.

But the options don't have 9. So perhaps this isn't the correct approach.

Wait, but why would the presence of spots cause the overall Teff to be 5500 K. But perhaps the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures. So, the ratio is an average of the two regions, not based on the average Teff.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K, but the line formation is happening in regions that are at higher and lower temperatures, leading to an average ratio.

Wait, perhaps the line is formed in a region that is at the average temperature.

But that doesn't make much sense because the line formation depends on the local temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the average of the ratio is computed based on the average temperature.

But that approach would give a factor of R1/R_5500 ≈ 9, which isn't an option. So perhaps neither approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the area or the flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is inversely proportional to the exponential term.

Wait, let me think again.

The ratio without spots is R_no_spots = R1.

When spots are present, the ratio is R_obs = (0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2) / (0.6 + 0.4 ) = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

Wait, no, because that's just R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 R2.

But earlier, we found R_obs ≈ 0.6006 R1, so the factor is about 1.66, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is not additive but multiplicative? Or perhaps the correct approach is to model the equivalent width or the line strength, which depends on the number of absorbers in each region.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of atoms in each level.

When the star is spotless:

n1 = total number of Ti atoms in level 1.

n2 = total number in level 2.

Ratio R = n2/n1.

When the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of two regions.

In the unspotted regions (60% area):

n1_1 = number in level 1,

n2_1 = number in level 2.

In the spotted regions (40% area):

n1_2 = number in level 1,

n2_2 = number in level 2.

The total number in level 1 is n1 = n1_1 * 0.6 A + n1_2 * 0.4 A,

Similarly, n2 = n2_1 * 0.6 A + n2_2 * 0.4 A.

The ratio R_obs = n2 / n1.

But since each region is in LTE,

n2_1/n1_1 = R1,

n2_2/n1_2 = R2.

So,

n2_1 = R1 n1_1,

n2_2 = R2 n1_2.

Thus,

n2 = R1 n1_1 * 0.6 A + R2 n1_2 * 0.4 A,

n1 = n1_1 * 0.6 A + n1_2 * 0.4 A.

So,

R_obs = [ R1 n1_1 * 0.6 + R2 n1_2 * 0.4 ] / [n1_1 * 0.6 + n1_2 * 0.4 ].

But to simplify, let's assume that the total number of Ti atoms is the same in both cases, but that's not necessarily true because ionization depends on temperature. But perhaps the problem ignores ionization changes and focuses only on the excitation between two levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of Ti atoms in neutral state is the same, but their distribution between levels 1 and 2 changes with temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that it's the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels. So, perhaps the ionization state (whether Ti is neutral) is the same, and only the excitation between levels is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of neutral Ti atoms is the same, but their distribution between the two levels changes with temperature.

Wait, but that complicates things further, as the total number would depend on ionization rates, which are temperature-dependent. However, the problem simplifies by assuming that the photosphere is in LTE, but perhaps the ionization balance isn't the focus here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is dominated by the excitation temperature, and the ionization is assumed constant.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try a different approach.

The ratio without spots is R1.

When spots are present, the ratio observed is R_obs = [ (0.6 R1) + (0.4 R2) ].

But earlier, we found R2 = 0.001544 R1.

So,

R_obs = 0.6 R1 + 0.4 * 0.001544 R1 = 0.6 R1 + 0.0006176 R1 ≈ 0.6006176 R1.

So, R_obs ≈ 0.6006 R1.

So, the ratio without spots is R1, and when spots are present, it's 0.6006 R1.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1 / R_obs ≈ 1 / 0.6006 ≈ 1.665.

But none of the options match this. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I calculated R_obs.

Wait, perhaps I should not have considered the area but the flux. Because the line strength depends on the flux from each region, which is proportional to T^4 (since flux is sigma T^4) multiplied by the area.

Wait, the flux from a spot is sigma T_spot^4 per unit area. So, the total flux from the spotted area is 0.4 * A * sigma T_spot^4.

Similarly, the flux from the unspotted area is 0.6 * A * sigma T_unspotted^4.

So, the total flux is 0.6 A sigma T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 A sigma T_spot^4.

But the line equivalent width depends on the number of absorbers in each region, which depends on the flux from that region.

Wait, perhaps the line strength is proportional to the number of absorbers in each region multiplied by the flux from that region.

So, the equivalent width from each region would be proportional to (n2_i * flux_i) and (n1_i * flux_i), leading to a ratio that depends on both the number of atoms and the flux.

Hmm, that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio observed is the sum of the contributions from each region weighted by their area and the ratio R_i.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.

Another approach: the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. When the temperature decreases, the ratio decreases because the higher level is less populated.

Wait, but the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is lower than when it doesn't have spots.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So, the ratio should be lower in that case.

But the problem is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

So, the factor is (R_no_spots) / (R_spots) = R1 / R_spots.

If R_spots is lower, the factor is higher than 1.

In my earlier calculation, when treating R_spots as the area-weighted average, I found a factor of ~1.66, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to model R_spots based on the average temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is R = exp( -E/kT ), and when T is 5500 K, as opposed to 6000 K, the ratio is lower.

So, compute R1 = exp(-99400/6000) = exp(-16.5667) ≈ 1.3e-7.

R_spots = exp(-99400/5500) = exp(-18.0727) ≈ 1.43e-8.

So, factor = R1 / R_spots = (1.3e-7)/(1.43e-8) ≈ 9.09.

But again, that's not an option.

So, perhaps the problem is not about the average Teff, but about the temperature of the spots and the unspotted regions.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is that the presence of spots reduces the overall effective temperature, but the ratio of Ti levels is measured in the individual regions. So, when the star has spots, the ratio in the unspotted regions remains R1, and the spots have R2.

But the observed overall ratio would be a sum of the contributions from each region.

Wait, perhaps the equivalent width of the line is the sum of the contributions from each region, which depends on the number of atoms in that level in each region multiplied by the flux from that region.

In that case, the contribution to the line strength from region i would be proportional to n_i * f_i, where f_i is the flux from region i.

But the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels would be n2/n1 = R_obs.

Alternatively, perhaps the line strength is the sum of the contributions from each region, and the ratio is determined by the combined line strengths.

But this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should consider each region's contribution to the line and then compute the ratio.

Each region contributes to the line strength as:

Strength_i = n_i2 - n_i1 = (R_i n_i1) - n_i1 = (R_i - 1) n_i1.

But n_i1 is the number of atoms in level 1 in region i.

But the total strength would be Strength_total = sum_i (Strength_i).

But the ratio R_obs = n2_total / n1_total.

n2_total = sum_i (R_i n_i1) = sum_i Strength_i + sum_i n_i1.

Wait, this is getting too complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the line is formed in a region with a certain temperature, but when the star has spots, the average temperature is lower, so the ratio is lower.

But that brings me back to the earlier calculation of R1/R_spots = ~9, which is not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ~7.8.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the exact value of R1 and R_5500.

Let me compute R1 and R_5500 precisely.

Compute R1 = exp( -99400 / 6000 ) = exp( -16.5666667 )

Compute exact value:

exp(-16.5666667) ≈ 1.32e-7.

R_5500 = exp( -99400 / 5500 ) = exp( -18.072727 )

Compute exp(-18.072727) ≈ 1.43e-8.

So,

factor = R1 / R_5500 = (1.32e-7) / (1.43e-8) ≈ 9.23.

Hmm, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the ratio of n2/n1, but about the excitation temperature.

Wait, the excitation temperature is defined such that:

n2/n1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(kTexc) )

So, Texc is the temperature that gives the observed ratio.

When the star has spots, the observed ratio is lower, so Texc would be higher.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio based on the average temperature.

Wait, the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is R1 / R_spots.

If R_spots is computed at the average Teff of 5500 K, then R_spots = exp( -99400 /5500 ) = exp(-18.0727) ≈ 1.43e-8.

Then,

Factor = (1.3e-7) / (1.43e-8) ≈ 9.09.

No matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the factor to be the inverse, (n2/n1)_spots / (n2/n1)_no_spots. But the question says the ratio decreases, so factor is less than 1. But the question asks for the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, which is (no spots)/(has spots), so the factor should be greater than 1.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the ratio is lower, so the factor is higher than 1.

So, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, let's recompute R1 and R_spots.

R1 = exp( -99400 /6000 ) = exp( -16.5666667 )

Compute 16.5666667.

We know that ln(2)≈0.6931,

ln(10)=2.3026.

Compute 16.5667 in terms of ln(10):

16.5667 / 2.3026 ≈7.2.

So, exp(-16.5667) = exp( -7.2 * ln(10) ) = 10^(-7.2) ≈ 6.3e-8.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1.3e-7, but 10^(-7) is 1e-7, 10^(-7.2) is about 6.3e-8.

Similarly, R_5500 = exp( -99400/5500 ) = exp( -18.0727 ).

18.0727 / ln(10)= 18.0727 / 2.3026 ≈7.845.

So, exp(-18.0727 ) = 10^(-7.845 ) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So, R1 is 6.3e-8.

R_spots = 1.4e-8.

Factor = 6.3e-8 / 1.4e-8 ≈4.5.

Ah, that's option C) ~4.5.

So, the factor is approximately 4.5.


Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. The ratio of energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2/g_1\) is the statistical weight ratio, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\))**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to Kelvin using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99400 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Ratio Without Spots (\(R_1\))**: At \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{99400}{6000}\right) = \exp(-16.5667) \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]

3. **Ratio With Spots (\(R_{\text{spots}}\))**: At \(T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\):
   \[
   R_{\text{spots}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{spots}}}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{99400}{5500}\right) = \exp(-18.0727) \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]

4. **Factor of Change**: The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{R_1}{R_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{6.3 \times 10^{-8}}{1.4 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
