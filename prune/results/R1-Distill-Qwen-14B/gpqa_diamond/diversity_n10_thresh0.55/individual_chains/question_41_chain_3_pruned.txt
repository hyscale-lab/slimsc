Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that light's speed in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, what happens when the medium itself is moving?

The question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is also moving in the same direction as the beam. So the light is going through the glass while the glass is moving towards us.

Wait, but normally, the speed of light in a medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion, right? Because from what I remember, the speed of light in a medium doesn't change due to the motion of the medium itself. Like, if you're in a car moving at speed v, the speed of light inside the car's frame isn't affected. Oh wait, but that's according to the theory of relativity, isn't it? Because according
