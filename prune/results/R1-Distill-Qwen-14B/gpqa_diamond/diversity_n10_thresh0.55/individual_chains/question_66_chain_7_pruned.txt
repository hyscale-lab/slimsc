Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let's break them down one by one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model.

Wait, what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which means the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations. That includes rotations and boosts. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected. I think that's a given.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Oh right, because the Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. That would mean both 1 and 2 are correct. Because if you have Poincare, you automatically have Lorentz, but wait, the question is whether all operators must respect each symmetry. So in SMEFT, I think the operators are constructed to maintain Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because Poincare is a
