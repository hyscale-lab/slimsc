Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And I have to choose the correct statement among options A to D.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. Because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, which correspond to real measurement outcomes. So any matrix that's not Hermitian can't be an observable.

Looking at the matrices:

Let me check each one.

W is:
Row 1: 0,0,1
Row 2: 0,1,0
Row 3: 1,0,0
Wait, so W is a 3x3 matrix. To check if it's Hermitian, I need to see if it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, W should be equal to its transpose. Let's see. The transpose of W would swap elements across the diagonal. For example, W[1,3] is 1, and W[3,1] is 1. Similarly, W[1,2] is 0, W[2,1] is 0. The diagonal elements are 0,1,0 in W, which in the transpose would be 0,1,0 in the same places. So W is symmetric, hence W is Hermitian.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Checking if X is Hermitian: The conjugate transpose of X should equal X. Let's compute the conjugate elements first. So for X^†, the (i,j) element is the conjugate of X[j,i].

Looking at X:

X^† would be:

Row 1: conjugate of X[1] (i becomes -i), conjugate of X[2,1] (1 remains 1), conjugate of X[3,1] (2i becomes -2i)
Wait, no, actually, the (1,1) element of X^† is the conjugate of X[1,1], which is i → -i.
The (1,2) element of X^† is the conjugate of X[2,1], which is 1 → 1.
The (1,3) element is the conjugate of X[3,1], which is 2i → -2i.

Similarly, the second row of X^† would be conjugate of X[1,2] (-1 → -1), X[2,2] (0 stays 0), X[3,2] (-1 → -1.
Wait, no, second row of X^† is the conjugate of the first column of X. Let me correct that.

Wait, more accurately, X^† is the transpose of the conjugate of X. So for each element (i,j) in X^†, it's the conjugate of X[j,i].

So, X^† would be:

Row 1: conjugate(X[1,1]), conjugate(X[2,1]), conjugate(X[3,1])
Which is: (-i), 1, (-2i)

Row 2: conjugate(X[1,2]), conjugate(X[2,2]), conjugate(X[3,2])
Which is: (-1), 0, (-1)

Row 3: conjugate(X[1,3]), conjugate(X[2,3]), conjugate(X[3,3])
Which is: (2i → -2i?), wait, X[1,3] is 2i, so conjugate is -2i. X[2,3] is 1 → 1. X[3,3] is -i → i.

So X^† would look like:
Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (-2i, 1, i)

Now compare this to X:
