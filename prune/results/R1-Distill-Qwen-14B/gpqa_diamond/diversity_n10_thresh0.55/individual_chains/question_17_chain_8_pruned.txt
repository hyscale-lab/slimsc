Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about calcium ions in a solution. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+.

The problem gives me the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, as 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but wait, since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that means that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

I think I can use the formation constant expression. The formula is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this case, are there any approximations I can make? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and when it's in solution, it's usually in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem states that the pH is ideal, so maybe it's already in the form that can fully deprotonate and form the complex. Also, perhaps I can assume that the concentration of the free EDTA is equal to the concentration
