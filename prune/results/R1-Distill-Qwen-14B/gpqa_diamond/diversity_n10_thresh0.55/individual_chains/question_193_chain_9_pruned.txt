Okay, so I've got this science problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. I think parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Right, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if plx increases, the star is closer, and if plx decreases, it's farther away.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. So, I need to figure out the relationship between N and r. Let's think about the variables here. 

Parallax (plx) is given by the formula plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as d increases, plx decreases. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting the formula for plx gives N proportional to d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. If plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N = k * (d^5), where k is a constant. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, so maybe we're looking for the differential change, like how many stars are in a thin shell at distance r. 

In astronomy, when you count the number of stars in a certain volume of space, the number you find depends on the volume. The volume of a spherical shell (like a thin layer) at radius r with thickness dr is approximately 4πr² dr. But in this case, the number of stars isn't proportional to r²; it's given as varying with parallax as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If N is proportional to d^5, then how does the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) behave? Or maybe the question is phrased a bit differently. It says 'per unit range of distance, r.' So I'm thinking, perhaps it's asking about the density or the rate of change of N with distance. That is, dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5d^4. But that's the derivative, so the number of stars increases with
