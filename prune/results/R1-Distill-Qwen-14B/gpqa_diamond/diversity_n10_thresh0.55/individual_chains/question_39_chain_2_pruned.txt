Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let's see what it's about. The question involves wave functions and normalization, I think. So, the setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. The task is to find the value of 'a'. 

Wait, I remember that wave functions must be normalized so that the integral of the probability density over all space is 1. Because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%. So the condition is that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

But wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Since the wave function is a complex number, the probability density is the square of its magnitude. So the square would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)² ] because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib, it's a² + b².

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function as given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So
