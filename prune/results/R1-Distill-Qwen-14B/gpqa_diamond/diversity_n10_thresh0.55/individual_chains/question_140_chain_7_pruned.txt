Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question talks about Substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also used.

Hmm, I remember that when a substance reacts violently with a liquid and releases a gas, it's often a metal reacting with an acid. The gas could be something like hydrogen or maybe another, but the part about W's molecule having the same number of protons and neutrons makes me think. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's consider that. Common gases from reactions are H2 (but H has 1 proton and 1 neutron? Wait, no, hydrogen usually is either H with 0 neutrons (protium) or deuterium with 1. So H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, wait. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons if it's protium. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hydrogen has atomic number 1, so each H atom has 1 proton. Neutrons can vary. So for H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Oh wait, but the question says the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the molecule must have a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, but another possibility is that the molecule is something else. Maybe CO2? No, that doesn't fit. Or maybe NH3? No, that's 14 protons and 14 neutrons? Wait, let me think. If the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons, then for the entire molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

Another thought: Maybe the gas is CH4? No, that's 4 protons and 4 neutrons? Wait, no, each C in CH4 is 6 protons and 6 neutrons (since carbon is usually C-12, which has 6 protons and
