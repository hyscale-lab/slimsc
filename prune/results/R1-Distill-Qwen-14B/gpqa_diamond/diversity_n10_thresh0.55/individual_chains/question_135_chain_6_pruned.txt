Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that the structure of the Lagrangian term involving a boson coupling to fermions usually looks like something multiplied by a fermion bilinear. Like, maybe it's a Yukawa interaction, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions in the Standard Model.

In the Higgs case, the interaction term is something like -y ψ ψ h, where y is the Yukawa coupling and h is the Higgs field. So in this case, the term is -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, wait, that seems a bit off. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as -λ (v + X) ψ_f ψ_f. So X is similar to the Higgs, but with a coupling λ. And v is the vacuum expectation value, I suppose.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, the question is about the possible decay channels of this boson. The options are all different combinations of fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that in particle decays, the available decay products depend on the mass of the boson. For a decay X → f f̄ to be kinematically allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. Because each fermion has energy at least equal to their rest mass, and since they are a pair, it's 2m_f.

So first, I need to list all the possible fermions that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Because if the fermion is more massive than 3 GeV, X can't decay into that pair.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. The charged leptons are electrons, muons, taus. Their masses are about: electron ≈ 0.0005 GeV, muon ≈ 0.105 GeV, tau ≈ 1.78 GeV. So X can decay into them
