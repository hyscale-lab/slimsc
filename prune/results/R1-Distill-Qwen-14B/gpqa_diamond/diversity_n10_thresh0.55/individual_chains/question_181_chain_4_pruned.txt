Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux after a hypothetical event. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped suddenly about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, I remember that in the Sun's fusion processes, there are different branches. The proton-proton chain has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II, but wait, the question mentions pp-III. Or maybe it's a typo? Oh, the note says it's definitely pp-III, so I have to go with that. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the different notations. So, the pp chain usually refers to the main proton-proton fusion, which is the pp-I branch, right? And then there's the pp-II and others, but I'm not entirely sure about pp-III.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which is the dominant process in the Sun. So if that stops, what happens? Oh, but wait, the pp-III branch must be a specific part of that chain. I'm not super clear on the details, but I remember that the pp chain produces neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos, through the process where a boron-8 captures an electron to become neutral lithium, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei and emits a neutrino.

So, the pp-III branch stopping would mean that this particular part of the fusion isn't happening anymore. But how does this affect the neutrino flux? Well, neutrinos are produced in various parts of the Sun's core, but if a significant part of their production stops, the
