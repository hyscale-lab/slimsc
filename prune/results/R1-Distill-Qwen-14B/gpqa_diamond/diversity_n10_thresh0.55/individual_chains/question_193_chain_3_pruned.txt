Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Hmm. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d is 1/plx. So if the parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, that means plx = d^{-1}. So substituting that into the equation: N ∝ 1/( (d^{-1})^5 ) which simplifies to N ∝ d^5. Because (d^{-1})^5 is d^{-5}, and 1 over that is d^5.

Wait, no, let me make sure. 1/(plx^5) = (1/plx)^5. And since 1/plx is d, then (1/plx)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, that would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases by the fifth power. But wait, that doesn't make sense in reality because stars are more concentrated nearby. Oh wait, this might be a theoretical scenario, not the real universe. So in this problem's setup, the number of stars increases with d^5.

But the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance, r. Oh wait, so it's asking about the density in terms of distance. Or maybe the differential number of stars as you move outwards in a thin shell of radius r.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars in a small volume element at distance r would depend on how many there are per unit volume. But perhaps the problem is looking
