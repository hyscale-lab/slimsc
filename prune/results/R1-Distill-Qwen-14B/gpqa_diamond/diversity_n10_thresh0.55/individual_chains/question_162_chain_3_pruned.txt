Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this is a 2D metric, so we're dealing with a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe? Or is it a 2D manifold itself?

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh right, in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The area might depend on the radius, but I'm not sure exactly how.

Let me recall some formulas. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would be a pseudosphere) with radius r is given by 2π (cosh r - 1), but wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe the area is infinite because the pseudosphere is a non-compact surface.

Wait, but the metric given here has a denominator (4 - x² - y²). Let's see. The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, does this resemble the metric of a hyperbolic plane? I think the hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²)] (dx² + dy²), where R is the radius. So in this case, the denominator is
