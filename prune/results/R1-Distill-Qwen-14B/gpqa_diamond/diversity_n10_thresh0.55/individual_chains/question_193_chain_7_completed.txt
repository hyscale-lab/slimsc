Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5? I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So like, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we're given that N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we'd have N proportional to d^5. Wait, because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean that as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe it's about the number density or the number per unit volume or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between number of stars and distance. Let's think about the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius (distance). But in this case, the number of stars depends on how many there are in that region. So if the parallax is plx, the distance d is 1/plx. So d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → substituting plx=1/d, we get N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, that's for a certain distance d. But when considering how the number of stars changes as you move from d to d + Δd, like the number per unit distance, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm to find the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, but the question says "per unit range of distance, r". So maybe we need to find the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr, divided by dr. So that would be the number density at radius r.

Wait, let's model it. The number of stars in a region is given by N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in a region at distance d is proportional to d^5. But wait, this can't be right because if d increases, the number of stars in a particular region (like a point) would change based on volume or something else. Maybe I'm missing something about how the number of stars depends on the volume.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of differential number of stars with respect to distance. Let's think about it in terms of differential elements. Suppose that the number of stars per unit volume depends on distance. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ d^5. But when you have a volume element in spherical coordinates, it's 4πr² dr, so the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to r² dr multiplied by the density. But if the density here is given as varying as d^5, perhaps that's different.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me start again. The problem says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is a constant. And since plx is 1/d, N = k d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But how does the number change with distance? If you move to a larger distance, the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about the change per unit distance. So maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to d. Let's compute dN/dd.

If N = k d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4. But the options given are in terms of r, not d. Wait, but in the problem, r is used as the distance variable. So perhaps the same applies: N ∝ r^5, and the derivative would be 5r^4. So the number increases with r^4 per unit distance. Wait, but let me see the options.

Options are A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5, C) ~ r^4, D) ~ r^2. So according to this, the derivative would be proportional to r^4, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance interval, which would be how many stars are there in a thin shell of thickness dr at distance r. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the surface area times dr times the number density. But in this problem, the number of stars in a region is given as proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So perhaps each shell's star count is proportional to d^5, but that seems odd because as d increases, the shell's volume increases as d^2 dr, so the density would have to compensate.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about it in terms of how the number of stars per unit volume (number density) depends on distance.

Given that N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx=1/d, N = k d^5. So the number of stars in a region is proportional to d^5. But the number density (stars per unit volume) would be N divided by the volume. Wait, but the region is a specific region, perhaps a slice. Oh wait, maybe it's a thin slice of thickness dr at distance d. So the volume of that slice would be approximately the area (which is πr², wait no, in spherical coordinates, a thin shell's volume is 4πr² dr.

But wait, the problem says "a specific region of the sky," which might imply a fixed solid angle. So perhaps we're considering a thin shell at distance d with a certain solid angle. So the volume element would be (solid angle) * d^2 dr. Because solid angle Ω times radius squared times dr gives the volume element. If the solid angle is fixed, then the volume element is proportional to d^2 dr.

So the number of stars in that region (the thin shell) would be N = (number density) * volume. Number density is how many stars per unit volume. But the problem states that in a specific region, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number density is given as such. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a unit volume is proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to model it more carefully.

Let’s define N as the number of stars in a region. Let’s say the region is a small volume element at distance d, with a solid angle Ω and thickness dr. So the volume of this region is approximately Ω * d^2 dr.

Now, the number of stars in this region is given by N = (number density) * volume. The number density here is the number of stars per unit volume (i.e., per cubic parsec or whatever unit). The problem says that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5.

But N is also equal to (number density) * volume. The volume is Ω d² dr. So:

N = (number density) * Ω d² dr = K (d)^5, where K is a constant.

Wait, but what is the number density? Because N is the total stars in the region, which is (number density) * (volume). So if I have N = (number density) * (Ω d² dr), and N ∝ d^5, then:

(number density) * Ω d² dr = K d^5 → (number density) = (K d^5) / (Ω d² dr) ) → (number density) = (K / (Ω dr)) d^3.

Hmm, but this seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the number density is given as a function of d. Let me think differently.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So for each distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But wait, that can’t be the case because if you consider a volume element, the number of stars would depend on both the number density and the volume. So perhaps the number density (n) is given by n = number of stars per unit volume. So n = N / (volume). If N ∝ d^5, and the volume is Ω d² dr, then n = (K d^5) / (Ω d² dr) ) = (K / (Ω dr)) d^3. That would imply that number density increases with d^3, but that doesn’t seem right because as you go further, you might expect fewer stars (if they are spread out), but according to the given, N increases with d^5, which is more stars as you go further. But that seems counterintuitive because the volume increases with d^3, so if the number of stars increases faster than that, the density would increase.

Wait, perhaps the given relation is for the number of stars in a fixed solid angle. So for a given solid angle, the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So for a fixed Ω, N = K * (1/plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = K d^5.

In a fixed solid angle, the volume of the shell (at distance d with thickness dr) is Ω d² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is N = n * Ω d² dr, where n is the number density. But from the problem, N = K d^5. So:

n * Ω d² dr = K d^5 → n = (K d^5) / (Ω d² dr) ) → n = (K/(Ω dr)) d^3.

But this suggests that the number density increases with d^3, which seems odd because if you're looking at a fixed solid angle, the number of stars per unit volume would increase as you go further. That doesn't sound right because, in reality, the density of stars might decrease with distance from the galaxy's center, but maybe in this problem, it's an inverse scenario.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). So perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Let me think about dN/dr. Since N = K d^5, dN/dr = 5 K d^4. So the number of stars increases by 5 K d^4 per unit distance. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So as distance increases, the rate at which the number of stars increases with distance goes up as d^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4, so that would be the answer.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases as \( d^5 \) with distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4
\]

This indicates that the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the given options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \)**: Incorrect, as the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \)**: Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \)**: Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \)**: Incorrect, as the change is not proportional to \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance interval increases as \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
