Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that's a bit confusing because stability constants typically increase with the number of ligands, but β4 is lower than β3. Maybe the complexes have different structures? Oh well, maybe the numbering is just arbitrary.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. Blue dithiocyanato... I think that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because Co with two SCN- is blue. Or maybe it's another complex, like maybe [Co(SCN)_n]^m+.

Wait, no. The blue one is usually the [Co(SCN)_4]^3− complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the problem just refers to a specific complex, maybe the one with two SCN ligands as the blue one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is blue. Hmm, regardless, the problem says to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyan
