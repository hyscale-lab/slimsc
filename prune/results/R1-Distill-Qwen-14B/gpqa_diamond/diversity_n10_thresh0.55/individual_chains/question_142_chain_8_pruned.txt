Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. The given density matrix is:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in a 2x2 matrix form. But wait, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? Hmm. I think this has to do with how density matrices are visualized. Maybe it's about the Bloch sphere?

Oh right! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state of a qubit. Every pure state is on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of pure states.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So this is an equal mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So ρ is a mixed state.

In terms of the Bloch sphere, the density matrix can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector in 3D space, and σ are the Pauli matrices. The vector r will have components corresponding to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me write down the general form of a density matrix for a single qubit. It's a 2x2 matrix:

ρ = [ [ a, b ],
       [ c, d ] ]

And for a valid density matrix, the trace should be 1, and it should be positive semi-definite.

But for the Bloch representation, any single-qubit state can be written as:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2

Where r_x, r_y, r_z are the components of the vector r, and σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So let's compute each part.

First, let's find the components of r.

The general form for ρ is:

ρ = (1/2) [ |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ]

But let me compute each matrix element.

|0⟩ is [1, 0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]].

Similarly, |1⟩ is [0,1]^T, so |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]].

Adding them together: [[1,0],[0,0]] + [[0,0],[0,1]] = [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I
