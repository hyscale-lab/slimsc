Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. It's about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, on the other hand, is unitary because it must preserve the norm of the state vectors.

Let me look at the matrices given. 

First, W is a matrix:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

I think I should check if it's Hermitian or unitary. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. W is a real matrix, and its transpose is the same as its conjugate transpose. Let me transpose W. The original W is:

Row 1: 0,0,1
Row 2: 0,1,0
Row 3:1,0,0

The transpose would swap elements across the diagonal. So, the (1,3) element becomes (3,1), etc. So the transpose of W is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W. So W is symmetric, hence Hermitian if it's real and symmetric. So W is Hermitian. Wait, what about unitary? A unitary matrix U satisfies U† U = I. For a real symmetric matrix, U being unitary would require it to have orthonormal eigenvectors and eigenvalues on the unit circle. Let me check if W is unitary.

Wait, W is:

[0 0 1]
[0 1 0]
[1 0 0]

The determinant of W is... let's compute it. For a 3x3 matrix, the determinant can be found by expansion. Alternatively, I can notice that W is a permutation matrix. Each permutation matrix has a determinant equal to ±1. Let me see, W swaps the first and third basis vectors. So the determinant would be (-1)^(number of swaps). Since it's a single swap (from 1 and 3), determinant is -1. So det(W) = -1.

If W were unitary, then W† W = I. Since W is real and symmetric, W† is W. So W^2 would be the identity matrix? Let me compute W squared.

Computing W^2: W multiplied by W.

First row of W:
0 0 1; when multiplied by columns of W:

First element (1,1): 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 = 1
(1,2): 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0
(1,3):0*1 +0*0 +1*0 =0

Second row of W:
0 1 0. Multiplying by W:
(2,1):0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0
(2,2):0*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1
(2,3):0*1 +1*0 +0*0 =0

Third row of W:
1 0 0. Multiplying by W:
(3,1):1*0 +0*0 +0*1 =0
(3,2):1*0 +0*1 +0*0 =0
(3,3):1*1 +0*0 +0*0 =1

So W squared is:
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

Which is the identity matrix. So W is unitary because W† W = I. So W is both Hermitian and unitary. Wait, but can a matrix be both? Because for a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real. For a unitary matrix, the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle. So the only way a matrix can be both is if all eigenvalues are ±1. Let me check the eigenvalues of W. Since W is a permutation matrix, swapping 1 and 3. So the eigenvalues are 1, 1, and -1. Because for a permutation matrix, the trace is the number of fixed points. W has trace 1 (since diagonal elements are 0,1,0). Hmm, wait, the trace is 0+1+0=1. So sum of eigenvalues is 1. The product of eigenvalues is determinant, which is -1. So possibilities: eigenvalues are 1, e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ} or something else? Alternatively, it could be 1, 1, -1. Because 1+1 + (-1) =1, and product is -1. So yes, eigenvalues are 1,1,-1. So W is both Hermitian and unitary. Interesting.

But moving on. Let's look at the options.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. Hmm. So e^X is the matrix exponential of X. The
