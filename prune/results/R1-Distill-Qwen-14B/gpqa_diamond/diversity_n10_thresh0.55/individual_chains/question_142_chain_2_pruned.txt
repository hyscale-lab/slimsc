Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but mixed states are statistical ensembles of these, so their density matrices are convex combinations of projectors.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Each term here is a projector for the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩, and they are being averaged with equal weights. So this must be a completely mixed state in a single qubit system. Because each state is equally probable, right? Like a classical coin toss between the two basis states.

I think in terms of the Bloch sphere representation, which is a geometric way to visualize qubit states. The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and any pure state can be represented as a point on its surface. For mixed states, the state lies inside the sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. The length of r must be less than or equal to 1 because the density matrix must be positive semidefinite.

So, let me write out each term. The identity matrix I is 2x2:

I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

The Pauli matrices σ are:
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

But in the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute that.

|0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ = (I/2). Comparing this to the general form:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

If I subtract I/2 from both sides, I get 0 = r·σ. That implies that r must be zero because the sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by r must be zero. So r = (0,0,0). 

So this state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere representation. Because it's a completely mixed state, it's the maximally mixed state, which is the center point. 

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which fits. The other options have non-zero values, which would correspond to some point on the sphere or mixed state but not the completely mixed state which is at the center.

Wait, another way to think about it. The density matrix ρ for a completely mixed state is (I/d), where
