Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations result in infinite values. Regularization helps make these infinities manageable so you can subtract them off or renormalize the theory.

So, let's go through each option.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, right? Maxwell's equations and all that. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the same kind of infinities that quantum theories do. Like, in electromagnetism, you can have point charges, but in classical theory, they don't naturally lead to the same divergences as in quantum field theories. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergent loop integrals or renormalization issues.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory. I know that QED does require renormalization, which involves dealing with divergences. So regularization is a part of handling QED calculations, especially loop diagrams. So QED does need regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. I remember that QCD has issues with things like Landau poles at high energies, but wait, maybe not. Wait, no, QCD is a theory that becomes strongly coupled at low energies (which is why quarks are confined), but at high energies (or short distances), it becomes weakly coupled, so perturbative methods work. But do you need regularization in QCD? I think so because of loop divergences. So regularization is used here as well.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Strings are supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as point particle theories. Regularization methods like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization might not be needed because string theories are background-dependent and perhaps more naturally avoid some divergences. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Strings still have to deal with things like
