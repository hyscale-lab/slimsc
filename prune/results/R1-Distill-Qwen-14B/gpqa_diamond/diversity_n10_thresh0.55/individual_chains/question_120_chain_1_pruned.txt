Okay, so I've got this question about the distribution of stars in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant one.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, but uniform distribution in what sense? If they're uniformly distributed in space, does that mean their number density is constant? Like, same number per cubic parsec everywhere. Or is it uniform in the sky, maybe on the celestial sphere? Hmm, the question says "uniformly distributed in the sky," so I think it's about their angular distribution. So perhaps the number of stars per unit area on the sky is constant?

Wait, but we're talking about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is an angular measure, so maybe it's about the change in the number of stars you observe as you look at different parallax ranges.

Let me think. So parallax plx is in arcseconds. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would depend on how many stars are at those distances. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance (d = 1/plx), we can think in terms of distance.

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant. The number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars is proportional to d squared times dd.

But wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So maybe their distribution is uniform in terms of solid angle on the celestial sphere. So for a given distance, the number of stars per unit solid angle is the same. So the number density in space might be constant, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the right way to model it.

Alternatively, if the stars are spread out such that their density in space is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. Since volume increases with the cube of distance, the number of stars in a shell at distance d would depend on d
