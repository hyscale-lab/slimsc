Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The parallax (often denoted as 'plx') is the angle at which the position of a star appears to change when observed from two points on Earth's orbit. So, the formula for distance in parsecs is distance = 1/parallax (plx). So, a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, right?

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. So, the same number of stars per volume regardless of where you look. Wait, but how does that translate into the number we observe with different parallax ranges?

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, like, how many stars have parallax between plx and plx + dplx? And how does this number change as plx changes.

I think I need to relate the number of stars in a certain parallax range to the actual volume of the space they occupy. Because when you look at stars, their apparent distribution on the sky depends on their actual spatial distribution and their distances.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is n stars per cubic parsec, say. Then, the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by that volume.

But how does the parallax relate to the volume? Let's think about it. The parallax is inversely proportional to distance (plx = 1/d). So, for a given parallax range dplx, that corresponds to a certain range of distances.

Wait, let's imagine that. Suppose plx is small, which means distance is large. Or plx is large, meaning the star is nearby. Hmm, right.

But the number of stars we observe in a certain plx interval depends on how much volume that corresponds to. Because even if the number density is the same, a larger volume would mean more stars.

Wait, but how does the volume depend on plx? Let's model this. Let's
