Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me see.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is a compound reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, what's that usually do? I remember the nucleophilic addition to ketones. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the cyanide can add to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN- would add to the carbonyl, making a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, which makes sense for a cyanohydrin.

So the first step must be a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. But for that, the ketone needs to be activated. Usually, you acidify the solution to generate the CN- as a nucleophile. Wait, but wait. NaCN is a source of CN-, but sometimes it's used with an acid catalyst. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no
