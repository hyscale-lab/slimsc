Alright, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun and how it changes if a certain part of the Sun's core reactions stops. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, and the proton-proton chain is a major one. The pp-III branch is one of the parts of that chain.

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton joins to form helium-3. The pp-II and pp-III are alternative pathways, right? So the pp-III branch probably produces different amounts of neutrinos, maybe higher energy ones?

So, if the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that the production of neutrinos from that specific part of the reaction would stop. But the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2) after the pp-III branch stops.

Wait, but what's the typical neutrino energies produced in each branch? I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp-I branch. Because, in the pp-I, the main neutrinos are the ones from the beta decay of boron-8, which have a certain energy. Or wait, no, the boron-8 neutrinos are actually from the He to B fusion, which is part of a different branch. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that the pp-I branch leads to the production of lower-energy neutrinos, like in the case of the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction, which produces lower-energy neutrinos. The pp-III branch, I think, is when two helium-3 nuclei combine to form carbon, but wait, that's part of the CNO cycle maybe. Or no, the CNO cycle is more about carbon, nitrogen, oxygen.

Wait, correction: the proton-proton chain's main branch (pp-I) goes like this: two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses with deuterium to form helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei can either combine to form helium-4 (pp-III) or undergo other reactions. But I'm getting
