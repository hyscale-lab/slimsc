Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. They also say the particles have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So, I'm picturing point P with one charge, and then 12 charges arranged around it, each at 2 meters away. 

The problem asks for the minimum energy of this system. Oh wait, energy in an electrostatic system is usually the potential energy between the charges. Since they're all fixed in place, the potential energy is just the sum of the interactions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Right.

Since all the charges are identical, each pair will contribute the same amount of energy. So I need to figure out how many pairs there are between the charges at point P and the others, and then sum all those
