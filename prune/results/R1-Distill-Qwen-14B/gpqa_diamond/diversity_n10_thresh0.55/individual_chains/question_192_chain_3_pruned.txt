Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields around a spherical conductor. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity, which is also spherical. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the cavity's radius is r, which is less than R. So the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Now, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is outside. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that in electrostatics, conductors have some interesting properties. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think that initially, without any charge inside the cavity, it would have no net charge. But how about when we introduce the charge +q inside the cavity?

Wait, right. When you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge. Since the total charge on the conductor is zero (because it was uncharged), the outer surface must have an equal amount of positive charge. Because the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor.

Wait, no, actually, the conductor being neutral, the inner surface must have -q because the charge +q in the cavity induces -q on the inner surface. Since the conductor itself must remain neutral, the outer surface must then have +q.

But the conductor is a spherical shell. So the electric field outside the conductor depends on the total charge enclosed. In this case, the total charge outside the conductor's inner surface is zero (because it's neutral) except for the induced charges.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor was initially uncharged. When you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge in the cavity creates an electric field which polarizes the conductor's material, so the free charges move to the inner and outer surfaces.

So the conductor's total charge is zero because it's uncharged. The inner surface will have -q, so the outer surface must have +q to
