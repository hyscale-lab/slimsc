Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, right. So I remember that when you have an operator, its eigenvectors represent the states that only change by a scalar (the eigenvalue) when the operator acts on them.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices for each component: Px, Py, Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a specific matrix. So first, let me write down each of these matrices.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0 1) and second row (1 0). So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0 -i) and second row (i 0). That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

And Pz is (ħ/2) times a diagonal matrix with (1, 0) in the first row and (0, -1) in the second, which is the Pauli Z matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it's not in the y-direction. So the operator P is probably a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled along the direction n.

Oh right! The general form for an angular momentum operator in a direction n is P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ are the Pauli matrices. But since our n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P simplifies to (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

But wait, the problem says n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1.

So the operator P can be written as (ħ/2)(nx σx + nz σz).

Hmm. Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is +
