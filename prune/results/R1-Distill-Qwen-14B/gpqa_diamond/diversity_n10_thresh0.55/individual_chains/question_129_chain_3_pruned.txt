Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps, and I need to follow each one carefully.

First, let me restate the problem. The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided. Hint a) talks about a reaction of compound A with an unknown phosphorous ylide resulting in 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hint b) mentions the IR peaks of A and E.

The options are A to D, which are different cyclic ketones.

Let me break down each step.

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B.

I remember that when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is something else, but given the IR data, let's think more.

Looking at hint b), the IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, A is a ketone. So, A is a cyclic ketone, perhaps. Because the options for E are all cyclic ketones, so the starting material A is likely related.

When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is an addition product with an -OH and -CN group added to the carbonyl carbon. So, the structure of B would have both an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

Wait, but HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the product would have an -OH and -CN both attached to the same carbon. So, B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached to the same carbon.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. H2 and Pd is a hydrogenation catalyst, probably for reducing nitriles. Wait, no. Wait, nitriles can be reduced to amines, but under H2 and Pd, I think they are hydrogenated to amines, but if using a different catalyst, like Raney Ni, maybe they become alkanes. Wait, what's the standard for hydrogenation of nitriles? Let
