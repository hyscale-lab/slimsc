Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The velocity is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K = (v) is proportional to (M planet / M star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), but wait, no, maybe there's another relation.

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (which is assumed edge-on for maximum effect, so sin(i)=1), and the orbital period. The formula is K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e
