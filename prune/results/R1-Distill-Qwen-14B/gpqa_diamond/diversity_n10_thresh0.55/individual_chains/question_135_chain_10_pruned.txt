Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by the Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, okay, I remember that in particle physics, the Lagrangian determines the interactions between particles. 

First, I need to figure out what particles the boson X can decay into. The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is important because the decay products' combined mass must be less than this. Also, the interaction term involves fermions ψf, so the decay products will be fermions and their corresponding antifermions.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is ψ̄ (something) ψ. The 'something' includes (υ + X), but I think the υ is just a constant, so the important part is X(y). So, the interaction is between X and the fermions ψf.

The possible decay products are pairs of fermions. So X could decay into ff̄, where f is a fermion. Now, I need to figure out which fermions are allowed. 

Wait, the fermion ψf here—what type are they? The interaction term probably means that X couples to all the fermions in the Standard Model, but more likely, it's a Yukawa-type interaction, so maybe only specific fermions are involved. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present, so perhaps I have to assume that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair allowed by the mass.

Wait, the boson X's mass is 6 GeV. So the decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. For each possible fermion pair, I'll need to calculate the mass of the pair.

Let me list the possible fermion pairs and their masses:

- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. So e+ e- pair mass is 2 * 0.0005 ~ 0.001 GeV. That's way less than 6 GeV, so allowed.
- Muon (μ): mass ~0.105 GeV. Pair mass ~0.21 GeV. Also allowed.
- Tau (τ): mass ~1.777 GeV. Pair mass ~3.55 GeV. Less than 6, so allowed.
- Up quark (u): mass ~0.003 GeV. Pair mass ~0.006 GeV. Allowed.
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV. Pair ~0.008. Allowed.
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV. Pair ~0.19. Allowed.
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV. Pair ~2.55. Allowed.
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV. Pair ~8.26. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So b and anti-b would sum to 8.26, which is larger than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV. But
