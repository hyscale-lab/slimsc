Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question says that |alpha> is an electron state proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, and |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection spin operator. So, first I think I need to normalize this state because the problem says it's proportional, which means we have to find the coefficients properly.

The operator A is given with matrix elements A_ij. It's zero when i equals j, and A_ij is hbar/2 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Because in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices have similar structures. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal. So probably A is proportional to sigma_x, but scaled.

The problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of operator A, and the average value of A.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, normalize |alpha>:

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the norm squared. That's |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2 (since (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2).

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state is 1/sqrt(7) times (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the operator A. Its matrix is zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, it looks like:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

Which is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2) * (+1) and (hbar/2) * (-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x (and hence A) are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x flips the spin, so those are the eigenstates.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+> and |->.

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me compute the coefficients c_+ and c_-.

c_+ = < + | alpha >

= [ <up| + <down| ] /
