Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino stuff, but let me think through this.

So the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. The problem says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? Because light takes about 8 minutes to get here from the Sun's surface, and the core is deeper, so maybe around 8-10 minutes. So if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, that means the neutrinos produced since then wouldn't have come from that process anymore.

Wait, but neutrinos from the Sun are mostly produced via the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, I think, but the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. Oh right, the pp chain has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II, and pp-III is a small part. So if pp-III stops, what does that mean for the neutrinos?

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos via the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus captures an electron neutrino to become beryllium-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei. And this produces high-energy neutrinos, right?
