Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. I remember that decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and how fast it's moving. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. 

The given data points are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, those units are in GeV and MeV, so I need to handle the units carefully.

I think the first step is to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/Γ. But wait, Γ is the total decay width, right? So yeah, that should give me the lifetime.

Next, I need the velocity of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E, which is much larger than its rest mass (because 8 GeV is way bigger than 1.2 GeV), I can probably use relativistic approximations. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is γ = E/(m c²). 

Wait, but E is given in GeV and m is given in GeV/c², so maybe the units can be handled more easily. Let me think. The energy E is 8 GeV, and mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So, gamma γ = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667, which is 20/3. 

The velocity can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v, we get v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Since γ is large, v is approximately c. Let me compute it exactly. 

Let me compute v:

gamma = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → so gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667... So gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈
