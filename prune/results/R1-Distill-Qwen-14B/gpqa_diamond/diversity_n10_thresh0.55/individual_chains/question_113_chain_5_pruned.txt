Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A to D.

Starting with the FTIR data. The peaks here are important. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. But the shape and exact position can tell more. For example, a broad peak around 3000 could be from an -OH stretch, maybe from a carbonyl group. Wait, but if it's very broad, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid or a phenol?

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb around 1700. The exact position can vary based on the functional group. For example, a ketone is around 1715, but conjugated double bonds or other substituents can lower that. Wait, 1700 might be a ketone, or maybe an ester or aldehyde. The peak at 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one, or perhaps an aromatic ring with some conjugation. Like an aromatic ketone or an amide? Or maybe an ester? Alternatively, 1650 might be a C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1600-1680. Wait, or maybe it's a carbonyl in an ester or conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. But then why the 1700? That seems more like a carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: If there's a conjugated system, like two carbonyl groups. Like maybe a diketone? Or perhaps a conjugated ester. Alternatively, maybe one is an ester and the other is a ketone or something else.

Wait, let's think: if the IR has a peak at 1700, that's probably a carbonyl. The 1650 might be from a conjugated carbonyl or a different functional group. Alternatively, maybe that's an aromatic C=C stretch. But then why would there be two strong peaks in that region? Hmm.

Now, moving on to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like CH2=CH. So that suggests that the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene or part of a conjugated system.

What about the Mass Spectrometry? The fragment peak is at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments could give that. Common fragments at 45 are like (CH3)2CO+ (acetone ion?), but wait, let me think. Another possibility is a fragment with (CH2)2O or something. Alternatively, the m/z 45 could come from a CH2=CH-O- group, but I'm not sure.
