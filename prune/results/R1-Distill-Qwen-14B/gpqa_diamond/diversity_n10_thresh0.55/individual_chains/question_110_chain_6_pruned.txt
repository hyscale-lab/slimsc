Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. 

First, I remember that each spectrograph has its own magnitude limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, any star that's brighter than or equal to 17 mag can't be seen by HIRES because it needs to be brighter than 16. Wait, no, wait. Wait, correction: ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, which means it can handle stars up to 17 mag and below, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Oh wait, no. Wait, the magnitude scale is a bit confusing. Lower magnitude means brighter. So, the V magnitude is lower for brighter stars. So, if a star has a V magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17. So, HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag, meaning any star with V ≤16 can be observed. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V ≤17. So a star that's V=16 would be observable by both. But a star that's V=17 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, let me get this right. The problem states: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, no. Wait the way it's written: "brighter than 17 mag" — but in astronomy, a brighter star has a lower magnitude. So, if a star's V magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17 mag. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V < 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V <16. So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V <16, because HIRES can only go down to 16. So, the apparent V magnitude of the star has to be less than 16.

Wait, but wait: the original question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Hmm, that wording is tricky. Because "brighter than 17" would mean the star's magnitude is less than 17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. HIRES can observe V <16. So, a star that's V=1
