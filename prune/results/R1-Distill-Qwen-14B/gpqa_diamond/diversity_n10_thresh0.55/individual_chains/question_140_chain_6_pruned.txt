Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. 

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Wait, 277 K is around 4 degrees Celsius, right? I remember that melting points of common substances... Maybe B is something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K, which is close to 277. But wait, 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe B is another substance. 

Then, there's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Subst X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, that makes me think of something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, which are strong oxidizing agents. They're used in various reactions, like oxidizing alcohols or other compounds.

Wait, the first part: X is a heavier isotope. So X has some element with a heavy isotope. Maybe it's potassium, as in K? Because potassium is known for having several isotopes, and sometimes compounds with potassium are used as reagents. 

So, let's think about what X could be. If X is a
