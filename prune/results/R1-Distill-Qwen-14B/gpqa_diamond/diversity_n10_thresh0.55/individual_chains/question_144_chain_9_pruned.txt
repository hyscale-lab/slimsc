Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance and its decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance has to do with the particle's lifetime and how it decays.

The question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. Mean decay distance... I think that's the average distance the particle travels before it decays.

Wait, what's the formula for the mean decay distance? Oh right, I remember something about lifetime and velocity. The mean path length L is calculated by L = v * τ, where τ is the lifetime. But how do I get τ from the given values?

Oh, right! The particle's lifetime is related to its decay width. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.

Hmm, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which has units of J·s. Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert everything to consistent units. Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Multiply τ by v to get the mean decay distance L.

First, calculating τ. Γ is 320 MeV. Let me convert that to Joules. I know that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. So Γ in J is 320e6 * 1.60218e-19.

Wait, but wait, Γ is in the denominator, so τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me get the value of ħ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

Γ = 320e6 eV = 320e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = let's compute that.

320e6 is 3.2e8. So 3.2e8 * 1.60218e-19 = 5.126976e-11 J.

Wait, wait, 320e6 eV is 320 million e
