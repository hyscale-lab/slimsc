Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember from my studies that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, which is commonly discussed.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. And the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think I remember that the SMEFT is built to respect certain fundamental symmetries. Let me break down each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think all physical theories in high energy physics must respect Lorentz symmetry because it's the foundation of how spacetime works. So operators in SMEFT would need to transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. That means all operators must be Lorentz scalars or transform appropriately as tensors or spinors. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely one that must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether SMEFT operators must respect Poincare. I recall that the SMEFT is constructed in a way that respects the Standard Model gauge symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry as part of it. But does that necessarily mean Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically included because the theory is formulated in a Lorentz-invariant spacetime with translation symmetry? Hmm, maybe. Or perhaps since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include Poincare. So I'm a bit confused, but I think Poincare (2) is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Now, CP symmetry (3). CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I remember that the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of certain processes like kaon oscillations. But wait, does SMEFT require all operators to be CP-symmetric? Or can they violate CP? I think in SMEFT, operators can have explicit CP violation. For example, the Weinberg operator in the dimension-6 terms doesn't have a CP issue, but some other operators might. So if the operators can violate CP, then the theory doesn't have to respect CP symmetry. So maybe CP (3) isn't a must-res
