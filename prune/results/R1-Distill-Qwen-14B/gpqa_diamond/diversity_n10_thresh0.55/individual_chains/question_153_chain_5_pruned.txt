Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael addition reaction. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question has three different reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with their own reactants and conditions. The options given are four possible sets of products (A, B, C), and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. In this case, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, which can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it forms an enolate, it's at the alpha position, right? The enolate would be the negatively charged carbon next to the carbonyl. Then, this would attack the beta carbon of another molecule. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the 3-position being p-tolyl. So the structure is CH2CH(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the CH2 group? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position is where the p-tolyl group is attached. So the structure would be CH2=CH(C6H4-4Me)CO-OCH3. Wait no, that can't be right because the numbering. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. The 3-position would be on the CH2 group. Hmm, wait. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=
