Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh, wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 times that. Also, their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—it's all electric potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. So I think the setup is that we have one charge at point P, and twelve others arranged around it, each 2 meters away. Since all the charges are the same sign, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum it all up.

Wait, but wait. Potential energy in an electric system is the energy stored due to the configuration of charges. Since all the charges are identical and positive (I assume they are positive because it's 2e, which is twice the elementary charge), they will repel each other. So the system's potential energy is going to be positive, and we're looking for the minimum energy. Oh wait, but wait—minimum energy would mean the most stable configuration. Hmm, but in this case, the charges are fixed in their positions except for the one at point P. Hmm.

Wait, no. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so the others are fixed at 2 meters from P. So all the 12 charges are each 2 meters away from P. So the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs.

But wait, how do I calculate that? I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since all the charges are identical, each pair contributes the same amount of potential energy. So I need to find the number of pairs and multiply by the energy per pair.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about how many pairs there are. There are 13 charges, but the 1
