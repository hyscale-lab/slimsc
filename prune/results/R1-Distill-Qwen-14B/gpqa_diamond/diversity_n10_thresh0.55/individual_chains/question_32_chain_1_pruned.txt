Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, right, so Lithium typically has 3 protons. Wait, if it's Lithium-6? Because Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons, and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

So the first thing I need to find is the rest mass of the Li nucleus. I think the mass number relates to the actual mass, but maybe I should look up the exact rest mass. But since I don't have that, perhaps I can approximate it using the sum of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are a bit less, around 939 MeV/c². Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass formula or using known isotopes.

Wait, perhaps I can recall that the mass of Lithium-6 is approximately 6 * 1.67e-27 kg (since protons and neutrons are about 1.67e-27 kg each). But that's the classical calculation, not considering binding energy. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me think. Oh wait, I think the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is about 10.8124 u, where u is the atomic mass unit (1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c²). So 10.8124 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives the rest mass energy in MeV.

Calculating that: 10.8124 * 931.5 ≈ Let's see. 10 *931.5 is 9315 MeV. 0.8124 * 931.5 is approximately 757 MeV. So total is about 1
