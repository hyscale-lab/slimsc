Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The options give different combinations for their relative speed and the total energy, so I need to calculate both.

Wait, but wait. The question mentions "relative speed" between them. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you would in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is a bit more involved. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²). Let me make sure I get that right. So u is the velocity of the second object from the first's frame, or vice versa. Wait, no, I think u is the velocity of the object as seen from the first frame, and we're finding the relative velocity of one with respect to the other. Let me clarify: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So if I'm astronaut A, I see B moving at what speed? Or wait, wait. The question says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So their velocities are in the same direction. So their relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but relativistically.

So let me compute v_rel using the formula. Let's say we take astronaut A (velocities u = 0.6c) and find the relative speed of astronaut B (v = 0.5c) from A's frame. So applying the formula: (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Wait no, wait. Because if I'm in frame A, then B's velocity is (v - u) divided by the denominator. Wait, no, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait, I think I'm confused. Let me recall: the relative velocity formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of A in the lab frame. So when you're in A's frame, the speed of B is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(
