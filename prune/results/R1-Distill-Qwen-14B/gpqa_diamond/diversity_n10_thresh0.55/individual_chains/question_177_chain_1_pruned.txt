Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the wavelengths they appear brightest— that's the peak wavelength, right? Because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law. 

Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is the same for both, and since b is a constant, T should be the same for both.

So both stars have the same temperature. That's an important point because when calculating luminosity, temperature plays a crucial role.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh wait, right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT^4. So luminosity depends on the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same temperature, T is the same for both. So L is proportional to R².

Wait, but the problem says Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) ) * (T1^4 / T2^4). But since T1 = T2, the T terms are 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options include 2.25, which is option A, but then there's option D which is ~2.23. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So
