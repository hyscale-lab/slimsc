Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question lists the characterization techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these gives different clues, so I'll take them one by one.

First, the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H groups. A broad peak here suggests the compound has an -OH group, maybe like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ and another at 1650 cm⁻¹. What do those correspond to?

The peak at 1700 is a strong one. That's usually a carbonyl group, C=O. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be another type of carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone. But wait, could it be an ester or a ketone? Or maybe an amide? Hmm, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide.

So, if there's a carbonyl group, that suggests either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the broad peak around 3000 could be from an -OH in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which can appear as a broad peak. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the O-H would be less broad, maybe around 3300-3500, but wait, the 3000 peak is very broad. Hmm.

Wait, so if the compound has a carbonyl (1700), and a broad O-H (maybe 3000), could it be a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have both a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester: but esters typically have two carbonyls, but wait, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. That might not fit.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be an ester, and the 1
