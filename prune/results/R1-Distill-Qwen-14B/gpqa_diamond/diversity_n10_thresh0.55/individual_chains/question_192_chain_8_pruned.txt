Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r being smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Wait, so the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor? Interesting. That probably affects the electric field somehow.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and a distance l from the cavity's center. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Oh, and l and L are both bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity should induce some charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field is zero. So charges will move to set up this condition. The charge +q in the cavity will induce a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge +q.

But wait, how does that work when the cavity isn't centered? Oh, because the cavity's center is
