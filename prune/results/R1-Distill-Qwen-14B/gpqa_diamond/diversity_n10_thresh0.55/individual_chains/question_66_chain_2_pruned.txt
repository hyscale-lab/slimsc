Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries are respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

Wait, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Right, that's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at a certain energy scale, beyond the Standard Model. These interactions are organized in terms of operators with increasing dimensionality.

Now, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

I remember that Lorentz symmetry is a big one. In the Standard Model, all terms respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is Lorentz invariant. SMEFT being an effective theory should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant, so option 1 is definitely correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. But in effective field theories, you usually work in a certain frame, like the rest frame, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, effective field theories are generally supposed to respect the same symmetries as the original theory. The Standard Model is Poincare invariant, so SMEFT should also respect that. So operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is correct. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I think that in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, but CP is not necessarily. The Standard Model has some CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So if operators are allowed to violate CP, then the symmetry isn't necessarily respected. So option 3, CP symmetry, might not be a required symmetry.

But CPT is different. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So any operator in a valid QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because the theory is built upon these principles. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are there exceptions? SMEFT allows higher-dimensional operators, but as long as they're Lorentz-invariant, they should still respect CPT, because the SM does. Alternatively, if the operator is CPT-even, then it's allowed. But SMEFT can include operators that are CPT-odd? No, wait, because in a renormalizable theory, you can have certain terms, but in SMEFT,
