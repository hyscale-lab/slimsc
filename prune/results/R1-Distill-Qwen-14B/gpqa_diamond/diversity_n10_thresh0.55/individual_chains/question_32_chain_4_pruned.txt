Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC, and I need to find the energy of the collider such that a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here nucleus X is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons equals 6, so Li-6.

The question is about the energy, so I'm thinking relativistic energy equations. The speed is given as 0.96c, so I'll need to use the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that first.

So v is 0.96c. Let's compute v squared: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784... Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28
