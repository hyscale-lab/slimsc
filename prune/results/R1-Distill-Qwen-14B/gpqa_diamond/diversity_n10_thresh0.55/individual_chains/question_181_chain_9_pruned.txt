Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, but all other reactions are still happening. I need to find the ratio of the flux in two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Wait, first, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches. The pp-I branch produces deuterium by two protons fusing. The pp-II might involve some other steps, and pp-III is another branch. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves more steps, like producing Be-7, then capturing protons to form B-8, and so on. But I'm not exactly sure about the details.

If the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Well, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos through the Beryllium process. So if that stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop. But the question says this happened 8.5 minutes ago, which is about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So the effect would be that the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would no longer be reaching us.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main solar neutrinos come from two main sources: the proton-proton chain (pp) and the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain contributes about 90% of the solar neutrinos, while the CNO contributes about 10%. But within the pp chain, there's the pp-I and pp-III branches, which I think produce different neutrino energies.

Wait, the pp-I and pp-III branches both contribute to the production of the neutrinos. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. When the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos from that process would stop being emitted. But the other branches, like pp-I and the CNO cycle, would continue.

Wait, the question is about the flux. Flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. So if the pp-III stops, the flux from that particular source would drop.

So, the
