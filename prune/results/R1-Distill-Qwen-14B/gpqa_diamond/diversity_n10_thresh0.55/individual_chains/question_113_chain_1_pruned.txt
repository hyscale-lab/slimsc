Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The most common ones are alcohols (which have a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding) or maybe carboxylic acids, but those are usually even broader and appear around 2500-3300. Wait, but alcohol O-H is around that 3000-3500 region, and it's broad because of hydrogen bonding. So that suggests either an -OH group or maybe an amide, but amides have different peaks. So probably an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, another peak in IR is at 1700 cm⁻¹ and another at 1650. Those are important carbonyl regions.

The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typically a carbonyl (C=O). That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is lower than 1700, which might indicate a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be an amide or something else. But considering the options, perhaps an ester or a ketone. But wait, in conjugation, the carbonyl might be around 1680-1700. Hmm.

So for the carbonyl, 1700 is a strong peak. Maybe an ester or a ketone. But wait, another peak at 1650: if it's an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1740, but maybe if there's conjugation, it could be lower. Alternatively, the 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a benzene ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an amide, but I don't think so because the other options are more likely.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically the protons attached to
