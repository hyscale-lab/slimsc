Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 parsecs is 2 parsecs away. So higher parallax means closer stars.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So if I imagine dividing the stars into slices where each slice is a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in each slice?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their density in space is uniform? So the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is the same everywhere.

Wait, but parallax relates to distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² times dd, assuming uniform density.

But since parallax p is 1/d, then d
