Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2= 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be four rings, or maybe a ring and double bonds, or something like that. Since the NMR shows some aromatic signals, probably there's a benzene ring involved. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H-NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about each peak. A triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's likely the aldehyde group.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of two equivalent protons each. Maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. Like, for example, in a diphenyl compound, each ring contributes a pair of doublets. So perhaps two benzene rings are connected.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet could be something like an enol proton or maybe an -OH group, but if it's an -OH, it might be exchanging and appear as a broad peak. But wait, the molecular formula has O, so maybe it's a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, it could be part of an ethylene group, but the broadness makes me think it's not an aldehyde.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So perhaps an -OCH2- group? Or maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but in what context?

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aldehyde group, two benzene rings, and an oxygen-containing group. Let's think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. Each benzene ring is 6 carbons, but if it's two benzene rings, that's 12, but the formula has only 8. Oh wait, perhaps the compound has one benzene ring and another group connected to it.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the
