Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe that doesn't affect things too much. The K value given is 5x10^10, and I'm guessing that's the formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, then the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So before any complex dissociates, [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But some of it will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me set up an ICE table. Let's denote the change as 'x'. So the complex dissociates to give x concentration of Ca²+ and x concentration of EDTA^4−. So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So the initial concentrations are [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are each 0, assuming no dissociation initially. But when it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of each ion. So x is the amount that dissociates.

But considering the K value is 5e10,
