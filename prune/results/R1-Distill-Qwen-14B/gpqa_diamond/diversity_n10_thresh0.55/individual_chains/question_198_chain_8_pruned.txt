Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato... so that's the Co with two SCN- ions? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{n+}, right? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^ something. Wait, the charge would depend on the oxidation state of Co. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1, so two would be -2. So the complex would be neutral? Or maybe something else. Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps the exact charge isn't crucial for the calculation. The key is that I'm looking for the fraction of Co that's in the form with two SCN- ions attached, which is the blue complex.

The stability constants, β, are given for each complex. I remember that β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, β = [complex]/([Co^{2+}][SCN^-]^n), where n is the number of SCN- ions attached.

So the complexes are probably:

Co^{2+} + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2+ - (n-1)} ?

Wait, maybe I should think of each step. For each β, what's the complex? Let's see:

β1 = 9. That's for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+. Because 1 SCN- is added to Co^2+; the charge would be Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+.

β2 =40 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because 2 SCN^- added: 2*(-1) + 2+ = 0 charge.

β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-1. 3*(-1) + 2+ = -1.

β4=16 → [Co(SC
