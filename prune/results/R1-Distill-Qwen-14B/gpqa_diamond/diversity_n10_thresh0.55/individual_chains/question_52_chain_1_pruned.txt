Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about stars with and without spots. When a star has spots, its effective temperature changes, and that affects the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. The question is about the factor by which the ratio of these atoms changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, wait, no, waitâ€”so the Teff when 40% is covered is 5500 K. Or is that the case? Let me read that again.

No, the question says when the surface is not covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature.

But wait, effective temperature is an average measure. So when parts are cooler (spots), the overall Teff drops. But how does that tie into the number of atoms in two energy levels?

The problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So we're looking for (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, but the problem states the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if the ratio goes down, then the factor would be more than 1. Like, without spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present.

In stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 14
