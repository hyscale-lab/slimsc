Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. And the options are given as A to D.

Wait, so the beam is moving through the glass and the glass is moving. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light travels through it. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here.

I recall that in a medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any movement, the speed would just be 1/n since c is given as 1 here. But the glass is moving, so does that add to the speed of the light relative to the lab?

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's just a simple addition. Let me think about reference frames. The light's speed in the glass is 1/n in the glass's frame. But from the lab frame, since the glass is moving, the speed should be adjusted.

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab's perspective, the light should be going faster than just 1/n, right? Because the medium itself is moving forward.

Wait, but how do velocities add in relativity? Oh wait, no, this isn't relativistic speeds, I think. Because the problem says "constant velocity v", which probably implies non-relativistic speeds, so maybe
