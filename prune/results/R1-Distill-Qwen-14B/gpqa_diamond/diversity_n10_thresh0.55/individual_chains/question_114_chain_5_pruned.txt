Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form a butanoic acid derivative. The options give possible choices for A and B.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And it's reacting with NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be the enolate formation or something else? Wait, wait. Oh, right, maybe it's the aldol reaction, but here NaCN is a nucleophile.

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. It can undergo nucleophilic addition. So if we add a cyanide ion, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in which conditions? I think that acid catalyzed addition. So maybe the first step is the formation of the enol, but NaCN is a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the product, we have 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. So the structure would be (CH3)
