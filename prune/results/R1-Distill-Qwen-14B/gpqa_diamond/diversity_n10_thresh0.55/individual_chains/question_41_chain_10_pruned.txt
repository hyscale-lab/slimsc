Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there's a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, right, the speed of light in a vacuum is c, which is given as 1 here. But wait, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the light's speed? I remember that in special relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as just adding them normally. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

So, normally, when you have two frames moving relative to each other, you use the Lorentz transformation to find velocities. But wait, does this apply here since the glass is moving and the light is inside it? Hmm, the glass is a medium, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass?

Wait, no. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. But how does that affect the speed of light measured in the lab. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So, maybe I should compute the speed of light in the lab frame by applying the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So the velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, wait. Wait, in this case, u is the velocity of light in
