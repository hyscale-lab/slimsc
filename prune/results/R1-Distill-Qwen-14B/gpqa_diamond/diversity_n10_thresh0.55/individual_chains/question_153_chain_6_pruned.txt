Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for these three reactions. Let me think step by step.

First, I'll try to understand each reaction one by one. The question gives three different Michael addition scenarios, each with their reactants and conditions, and asks what the major products are.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So, NaOEt is a strong base, and in ethanol, it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, what's a Michael addition again? Oh right, it's when a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the beta carbon of another compound, which is the Michael acceptor.

In this case, the first reactant is dimethyl malonate. I think that's a good enolate precursor. The structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH2. When deprotonated at the central CH2, it forms a strong enolate.

The second reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, where the E configuration means the substituents (p-tolyl and the ester) are on opposite sides. Wait, no, wait: the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond are at the 3-position. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=O)-OCH2CH3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Or perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl, no, wait no.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait.
