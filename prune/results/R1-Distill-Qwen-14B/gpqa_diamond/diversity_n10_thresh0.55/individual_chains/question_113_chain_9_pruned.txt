Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching, like from alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, if it's a very broad peak, could it be an alcohol, or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, right, alcohols have a broad peak because the O-H stretches are very strong and broad. Or maybe a carboxylic acid would have an even broader and possibly lower wavenumber peak, but 3000 is kind of high. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but ethers don't usually show a broad O-H peak. So probably an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl group with some hydrogen bonding, like a conjugated system? Or maybe it's a ketone with some stretching, but I think that's less likely. Wait, the 3000 is very broad, so more likely an O-H group, so either alcohol, carboxylic acid, or maybe even an amide, but the problem doesn't mention N, so probably not an amide.

Also, the FTIR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, those are carbonyl regions. 1700 is usually a carbonyl, like
