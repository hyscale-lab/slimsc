Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is broken down into its X, Y, and Z components, each represented as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, an eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a direction in which the operator acts by merely scaling the vector. The eigenvalue tells us by what factor it's scaled. Here, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The operator P is a vector operator, I think. So P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by their respective matrices.

Wait, let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator P is given as a vector in some direction. The direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which means it's in the x-z plane, so no y-component. So, the direction can be represented as (x, 0, z) or in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is in the x-y plane. But since it's in x-z, φ must be 0 or π, I think. Wait, no, actually, any direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but perhaps they're considering a general direction where φ can vary, but in this case, since n is arbitrary in x-z, maybe φ is arbitrary but the direction is specified by some θ angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or 180 degrees. Hmm, but the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, so perhaps the direction is given by θ from the z-axis, and φ = 0, because it's
