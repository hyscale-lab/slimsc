Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that titration involves neutralizing an acid with a base, and the pH changes depending on where you are in the titration process. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I should probably calculate the new concentration after dilution. Oh, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, and the volume V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I need to find both values.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

First, I should find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. Let's think about moles. Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 40 cm³ (since it's diluted). Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, but when titrated, the volume changes. Wait no, maybe I should calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Wait, let me re-calculate. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, which matches what I thought earlier.

So when titrating, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 moles. Because the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001.

So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. Moles are 0.001, concentration is 0.1 M. So V = 0.001 / 0
