Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but let's see if I can figure it out. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/distance, but wait, actually it's plx (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

The number of stars N is varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. 1 over (1/r^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait, that can’t be right because with more distance, you’d expect fewer stars in a unit volume, but this suggests N increases with r^5. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the question says how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance. So it's the density or the number per unit volume, perhaps? Or maybe it's the number of stars in a shell of radius r to r+dr. So the number of stars as a function of distance r?

Wait, let's think again. If parallax plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So N = k * (1/plx)^5 = k * r^5. But this would mean that as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. That seems odd because, generally, as you look further away, the number of stars you can see in a given volume would decrease because they're more spread out. Unless the density of stars is increasing with distance, but that's unlikely in the universe.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the setup wrong. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C / (plx)^5, where C is a constant. Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N = C * r^5. So N increases with r^
