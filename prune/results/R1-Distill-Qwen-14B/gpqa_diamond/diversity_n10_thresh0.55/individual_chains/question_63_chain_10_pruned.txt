Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So I remember that diatomic molecules can be treated as a rigid rotor for rotational energy and a harmonic oscillator for vibrational energy. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length changes, but for the fundamental state, maybe that's not too important here.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? But wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm guessing they're talking about a transition from the ground state to the first excited state.

Wait, in the quantum models, the energy levels are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the total energy E is the sum of the rotational energy (E_rot) and vibrational energy (E_vib).

But the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule could absorb a photon that either increases its vibrational state, rotational state, or maybe both? But in the non-rigid rotor model, I think the bond length isn't fixed, but for the purposes of calculating the photon's momentum, maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor for the transition.

Wait, but the problem gives me the angular frequency of vibration (w = 4e14 rad/s) and
