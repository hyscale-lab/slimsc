Okay, I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers can prioritize their observation time. Let me think through the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, in this case, the planets have the same mass, but their host stars might have different radii or other factors.

Wait, the question says both stars have the same radii. Oh, that's important. So the host stars have the same radius, but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But since the radii are the same, that might not directly affect the transit probability.

I recall that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula for the probability (P) is roughly (R_planet / R_star) squared multiplied by something else... Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance divided by the star's radius. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)Â² multiplied by the probability factor from the orbital alignment. But wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The transit probability is actually the geometric probability, which depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, let me think. The transit probability (P) is approximately (R_s / a)^2, where R
