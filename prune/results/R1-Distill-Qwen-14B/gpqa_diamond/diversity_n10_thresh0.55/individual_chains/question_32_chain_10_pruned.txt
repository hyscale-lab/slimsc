Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons. Oh right, Li-6 is the common isotope, but this is Li with 3 neutrons, so that makes it Li-6? Because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make the atomic mass 6. So X is Li-6.

The problem is asking for the energy. I remember there are different types of energies in relativity—rest mass energy, kinetic energy, total energy. Since we're talking about colliders, I think the energy here refers to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy.

The speed is given as 0.96c, so I need to calculate the total energy using the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that formula down: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v = 0.96c: v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that square root. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, wait. Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: Let me think, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc². So I need to find the mass of Li-6.

Wait, wait. The nucleus is a collection of protons and neutrons. Each neutron and proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². For Li-6, it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass is (3 * 938) + (3 * 93
