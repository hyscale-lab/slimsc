Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models when considering their rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor accounts for bond length changes, which affects the moment of inertia and the rotational energy levels. But wait, the problem is about the fundamental state moving to the next lowest energy state. I need to think about what transitions are allowed.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state, right? So for a diatomic molecule modeled in the quantum model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The energy levels for vibration are quantized, given by (n + ½) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. For rotation, the energy levels are (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number, and I is the moment of inertia.

But wait, the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the fundamental would likely involve a change in either J or n. But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational states are quantized, and the vibrational states are as well. So the fundamental state is n=0 and J=0. The next lowest state could be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). But which one has lower energy?

To figure that out, I need to compute the energies of these possible transitions. Let's think about the energies involved.

First, let's calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + ½) ħω. The difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

For the rotational transition, the energy levels are E_rot = [J(J+1)ħ²]/(2I). The difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE_rot = [ (1*2) - (0*1) ) * ħ² ]/(2I) = (2 - 0) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So which of these energy differences is smaller? If ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vib, then the rotational transition would require less energy and would be the next state. Otherwise, the vibrational transition would be the next state.

So I need to compute both ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib and compare them.

Given the data:
Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
R = 2 angstroms
ω = 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, so the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Let's compute μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) * amu.

Wait, let me compute that. Mx is 20, My is 2. So Mx + My = 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.8182 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.8182 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's compute that.

1.8182 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.023e-27 kg.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately: 1.8182 * 1.6605 = let's see. 1.8*1.66 is about 2.988, but more precisely:

1.8182 * 1.6605: Let's compute 20/11 * 1.6605. 20/11 is approximately 1.8182. 1.8182 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1.8182 * 1.6605 ≈ (1.8 * 1.6605) + (0.0182 * 1.6605)
= 2.9889 + 0.0290 ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.0179e-27 kg.

But wait, I should double-check the calculation:

Wait, amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So for μ:

μ = (20 * 2 / (20 + 2)) * amu = (40/22) * 1.660539e-27 kg.

40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.8181818...

So 1.8181818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ let me compute:

1.8181818 * 1.660539 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.660539 = 2.989. 0.0181818 * 1.660539 ≈ approx 0.029999. So total is approx 3.019 kg? Wait, no, no. The product is 3.019e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.019e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I is μ R², with R given in angstroms. R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me compute 3.019e-27 *4e-20: 3.019*4=12.076, exponents 1e-27 * 1e-20=1e-47? Wait, no, 1e-27 and 1e-20 multiply to 1e-47. So 12.076e-47 kg m²? Or 1.2076e-46 kg m². Right, because 12.076e-47 is 1.2076e-46.

Now, compute ΔE_rot, which is the energy difference between J=0 and J=1.

ΔE_rot = [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] * ħ²/(2I) when J goes from J to J+1. Wait, for J=0 to J=1: the energy is E_1 = (1*2)ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

And E_0 is 0, so ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

So let's compute ħ²/(I):

ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Now, I is 1.2076e-46 kg m². So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.20e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that division: 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.2076) * 1e(-68 +46) = approx 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, compute ΔE_vib, which is ħω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħω = 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 s^-1 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

So now comparing ΔE_rot (9.2e-23 J) and ΔE_vib (4.218e-20 J). Oh, wait, 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. That means the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that causes a rotational transition, because it's a lower energy.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would have the lowest possible energy, which would be the rotational transition, since it's lower in energy than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy should match the ΔE_rot. Therefore, the photon's energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Because photons have energy E = pc, so p = E/c.

Wait, but wait: for a photon, E = hν = pc. So p = E/c.

So the momentum p_photon is E_photon / c.

So let's compute that.

E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23) / (3e8) = approx 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's a very small momentum. Looking at the answer choices:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → which is kg m/s, since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

B) 2.3e-27 kg m/s.

C) 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

D) 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, but my calculation gave 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy calculations. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the vibrational and rotational energies correctly. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change. But the question is about the lowest possible energy, so the molecule would transition to the next lowest state. So perhaps the next state is J=1, n=0, which is a pure rotational transition.

Wait, but I think the calculation is correct. So if the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options are much higher. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in computing the moment of inertia.

Wait, let's recheck the moment of inertia.

I = μ R².

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

μ is correct as (20*2)/(20+2) amu = (40)/(22) amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 = approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * 4e-20 m².

3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 12.072e-47 kg m² → 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Then, ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s². So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = 9.2e-23 J. That seems correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the options are on the order of 1e-28 Ns, which is 1e-28 kg m/s. Because 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

Hmm, so I must have made an error. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first excited state. But in the rotational-vibration model, the first excited state could be either v=1, J=0, or v=0, J=1, whichever has lower energy.

Wait, I thought that the rotational transition is lower in energy. But perhaps the vibrational transition is higher. But in my calculation, the rotational transition's energy is much lower than vibrational.

But the options are all much larger than what I got, so perhaps I messed up the calculation of the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE_rot.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = [ J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I). So the energy for J=0 is 0, and J=1 is (2) * [ ħ²/(2I) ] = ħ²/(I).

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not about the rotational transition, but about the transition involving both vibrational and rotational. Or perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state, which would require a higher energy and thus a higher momentum.

Wait, let's compute the photon momentum for both possibilities.

Case 1: Photon provides energy for rotation transition. E_photon = 9.2e-23 J → p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Case 2: Photon provides energy for vibrational transition. E_photon = 4.218e-20 J → p = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, that's option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower in energy and thus would be the next state, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So if the vibrational transition requires more energy, but that's the next possible state, but perhaps the molecule can't make a higher energy transition. Wait, no, the molecule would prefer to transition to the lower energy state first.

Wait, but according to the quantum numbers, the next state (lowest in energy) after the ground state (v=0, J=0) is either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy?

Compute both energies.

v=0, J=0: E = (0 + ½)ħω + 0 = (½) ħω.

v=1, J=0: E = (1 + ½) ħω + 0 = (3/2) ħω.

v=0, J=1: E = (0 + ½) ħω + [1*(1+1) ħ² ]/(2I) = (½) ħω + [2 ħ²]/(2I) = (½) ħω + ħ²/(I).

So the energy for (v=0, J=1) is (½) ħω + ħ²/(I).

Compare this to (v=1, J=0), which is (3/2) ħω.

Which is lower? Let's compute the two.

We have:

E_vib = (3/2)ħω = 3/2 * (4e14 rad/s) * ħ.

Wait, ħ is 1.05457e-34 J s. So 4e14 * ħ = 4e14 *1.05457e-34 ≈ 4.218e-20 J. So E_vib = 3/2 * 4.218e-20 = 6.327e-20 J.

E_rot = (½) ħω + ħ²/(I) = 0.5 * 4.218e-20 J + 9.2e-23 J = 2.109e-20 +9.2e-23 = approximately 2.109e-20 + 0.092e-20 = 2.201e-20 J.

So E_rot (2.201e-20 J) is less than E_vib (6.327e-20 J). So the next state is the rotational transition, which requires a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J. Which gives photon momentum 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options match that.

Wait, but the options don't have anything close to 1e-31. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in units or calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should evaluate the moment of inertia again.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Let me recompute I.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) amu = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.818 *1.6605 = Let's calculate:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.018 *1.6605 = 0.029889.

Total: 2.9889 +0.029889 = 3.018789e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018789e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018789e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075156e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_rot. Let's recompute.

ΔE_rot = (E_J1 - E_J0) = [ (1)(2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34 J s)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then, ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2075e-46 = approx 9.20e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the photon that causes a transition to the next state, which may involve both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would be a higher energy.

Wait, but the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy state above the fundamental is the rotational transition.

But my calculation gives a very small momentum, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the photon is being absorbed to make a transition from the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state to the next higher state, which could be a combination of both. But I think the model allows for transitions where only one quantum is absorbed, either increasing J by 1 or n by 1, not both.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given model is the non-rigid rotor, which affects the moment of inertia. Oh, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond length changes, which would affect I. But in the problem, R is given as 2 angstroms. I think that the moment of inertia is taken as μ R², which I've already calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with E = ħω. So the momentum would be (ħω)/c.

Let me compute that.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 s^-1 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.406e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

But earlier calculation suggests that the rotational transition requires a lower energy. So why is this the case?

Ah, perhaps because the rotational energy levels are much closer together, and the vibrational transitions require higher energy.

Wait, but in that case, the rotational transition would have a lower energy and thus be the next possible state. But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational's 4.2e-20 J.

So why would the molecule not transition to the rotational state first?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which state is the next in energy. Because even though the rotational transition requires less energy, maybe the next state in terms of the quantum numbers isn't considered the 'next' state. Or perhaps the question is referring to the first excited state, which is the first possible state, not the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the question states, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the one with the smallest ΔE from the fundamental state. So the rotational transition would be the next state because it requires less energy.

But according to my calculations, the rotational transition's photon momentum is around 3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't any of the options. The options have higher momentum values.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by the rotational constant or something else. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, given by ħ²/(2I). So for J=0, E=0. For J=1, E = 2B.

But in my case, ΔE_rot is 2B, where B = ħ²/(2I).

So ΔE_rot = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I), which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the vibrational energy difference.

Wait, but why the options don't match my calculation. Let's recheck all steps.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the photon's momentum. Wait, the energy of a photon is E = pc, so p = E / c.

In the rotational case, E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this.

In the vibrational case, E_photon = 4.218e-20 J.

p = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s → which is about 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So perhaps the question is looking for the vibrational transition, not the rotational. But according to the energies, the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia is different, but the given R is fixed? No, R is given as 2 angstroms, so I think it's treated as a fixed bond length for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, not the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the absorption of a photon that causes a transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state and the first rotational state. But that would be a higher energy state.

Hmm, but the question is about the 'next' state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one requiring the least energy, which is the rotational state.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rigid rotor model, so the moment of inertia is fixed.

Wait, but I used the correct μ and R to compute I.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reduced mass accurately.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.8182 amu.

1.8182 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 3.018e-27 kg.

That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the rigid rotor but the non-rigid vibration model? No, the model is the non-rigid rotor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking about the photon that causes the molecule to transition from the ground state to the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires E = ħω. Because perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state. But why would it not choose the lower-energy rotational state?

Wait, perhaps because in reality, vibrational transitions are much stronger and more likely? But the question is about the next state with the lowest energy, not the selection rules or likelihood.

Hmm, going back to the problem statement:

The molecule is in its fundamental state. What momentum should the photon have to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy above the fundamental state.

So the rotational transition requires less energy (9.2e-23 J) than the vibrational (4.2e-20 J). Therefore, the photon should have E = 9.2e-23 J, p = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the pure rotational transition, but a transition where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers change. But that's not the case for the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has an error in the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using the vibrational energy difference, and the answer is option D, which is about 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered, given that it has lower energy?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the rotational energy and the vibrational energy.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy must match the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences.

No, because the next state would be either a vibrational or rotational change, but not both.

Wait, but if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next state could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which one is lower in energy?

As I calculated earlier, E_rot (v=0, J=1) is about 2.2e-20 J, while E_vib (v=1, J=0) is about 6.3e-20 J. So the rotational state has lower energy.

So why is the option D matching the vibrational transition? Because according to calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon with much lower momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition as part of the fundamental state? Or perhaps the question is considering the rotational model separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the energy levels.

Wait, let me think about the energy of a photon in terms of angular frequency.

E_photon = ħ * ω_photon.

But ω_photon = c * k, where k is the wavenumber (1/λ). But in this case, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between states.

Wait, but the problem is that according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires a photon of 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational photon's 4.2e-20 J.

But none of the options match the rotational photon's momentum.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition, and the answer is option D, 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

But why would the molecule transition to a higher energy state when a lower one is available? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, regardless of which requires less energy. But that contradicts the question's wording.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the next state, which could be either rotational or vibrational, but the problem specifies that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So the next state is the one with the lowest possible energy, which is the rotational state.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the model being used includes both rotational and vibrational energy contributions, and the next state is the one where the vibrational state is excited, but the rotational state remains the same. Or perhaps the question includes both in the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = ħω = 1.055e-34 *4e14 =4.22e-20 J.

p_photon = 4.22e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) = 1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

But according to the energy calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the problem ask for the vibrational transition?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational states, but only the vibrational transitions. But the question explicitly mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the photon cause a vibrational transition, and the rotational transition is not considered because, for the non-rigid rotor, the moment of inertia changes, complicating the energy levels, but perhaps the given R is the equilibrium bond length, and the non-rigid model allows for R to change, but in this case, the transition is purely vibrational.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the next state as the first vibrational state, ignoring the rotational transitions. But that would be against the model's description.

I'm a bit stuck here. According to the calculations, the rotational transition requires a lower energy photon, but it's not one of the options. The vibrational transition's photon momentum is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recompute ΔE_rot.

ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I).

I = μ R² = (40/(22) amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So, ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approximately 9.2e-23 J.

That's correct.

So the momentum is 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences between the fundamental state and the next possible states. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, and the next state with the lowest energy is determined by comparing the rotational and vibrational energy transitions.

### Key Parameters:
- **Mass of atom X**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Mass of atom Y**: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency of vibration**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Reduced Mass:
The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Moment of Inertia:
The moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
\]

### Energy Differences:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega.
   \]
   The energy difference between \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison of Energy Differences:
The rotational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition.

### Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition:
The energy of the photon must match \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \). The momentum \( p \) of the photon is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c},
\]
where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( E = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \):
\[
p = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]
However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

### Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition:
If the transition is to the vibrational state instead, the photon energy is:
\[
E = \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]
The corresponding momentum is:
\[
p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
\]
This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
Although the rotational transition requires less energy, the provided options suggest that the problem is asking for the photon momentum corresponding to the vibrational transition. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
