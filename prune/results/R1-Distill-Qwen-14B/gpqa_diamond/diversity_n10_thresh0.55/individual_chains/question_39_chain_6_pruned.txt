Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions should satisfy certain conditions, right? Oh, right, the normalization condition. The integral of the probability density must be equal to 1 over the entire space where the particle exists. 

The problem says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero (or non-existent) for x <1 and x>3. Therefore, the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. 

So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. Therefore, the normalization condition applies to this interval. The wave function given must be normalized, so the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - (0.5)i. 

The probability density is |ψ|² = ψ* ψ. So let's compute that. 

ψ* would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Multiplying this by ψ:
( a/(sqrt(1+x)) )
