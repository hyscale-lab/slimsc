Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. I remember that luminosity depends on radius and temperature, right? The formula I think is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the key here is figuring out the temperatures of the stars.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, T would be the same because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. How does that affect the luminosity? Luminosity depends on R² and T⁴. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)². Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

But wait, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Plugging that into the ratio, we get (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times
