Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with complex ion formation. Right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) tells us how stable the complex is. So the higher the K, the more the complex forms.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which I'll call [CaEDTA]^2-. Since the complex is stoichiometric, I think it means that each Ca^2+ ion is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

But wait, the formation constant K is given as 5e10. Formation constant, Kf, is defined as [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh right, that's the expression for K.

We're given that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But we don't know [Ca^2+] or [EDTA^4-], and we need to find [Ca^2+].

I remember that in such problems, we can often make approximations. Since K is very large (like 1e10 or more), the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free ions (Ca^2+ and EDTA) would be very low. So perhaps we can assume that the majority of the EDTA is in the complex form.

Wait, but in this case, the initial situation is that the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex form? Or is some of it dissociated?

Wait, no. The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So let's think about what's present. The complex dissociates to some extent into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M
