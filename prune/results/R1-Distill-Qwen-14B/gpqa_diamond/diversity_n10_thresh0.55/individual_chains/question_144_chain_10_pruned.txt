Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance given the production energy, mass, and width. The numbers are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The mean decay length would be the velocity of the particle multiplied by its lifetime. So the formula must involve the lifetime, which in turn depends on the particle's width.

Wait, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is τ. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ, right? Or wait, actually, it's τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units might be a bit tricky here. So Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something? Let me think about the constants. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, but maybe I don't need to convert everything right now.

So first step: calculate the lifetime τ. Then find the velocity of the meson. Then multiply velocity by lifetime to get the mean decay distance, L = v * τ.

Wait, but the production energy is 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the meson is probably moving at relativistic speeds. I should probably calculate the velocity using the energy and mass.

Wait, the production energy is the energy of the meson when it's produced, right? So E_X is the total energy of the particle, which includes rest mass and kinetic energy. So E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but the units here are in GeV, so I need to make sure units are consistent.

Actually, in particle physics, people often set c=1 and use natural units, so E (in GeV), mass m (in GeV/c²), and so on. So perhaps the calculation is done in natural units where c=1 and ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me get this straight. The total energy E of the meson is 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV/c². So the gamma factor γ is E/(m c²). But in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E/m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, the velocity v can be found from gamma. The relation between gamma and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) * c. But if c is taken as 1 in natural units, then v = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's compute that.

Wait, gamma is about 6.6667. So 1/γ is approximately 0.15, so 1/γ² is 0.0225. So 1 - 1/γ² ≈ 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. So like 0.99c. Close to the speed of light.

So now, the velocity is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. Let's denote c as 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s
