Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit challenging, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are several steps involved, and some hints to guide me. I'll start by breaking down the information given.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, there are hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones, so I'm guessing E is a ketone. 

Let me think about each step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, like in ketones or aldehydes. So if A has a carbonyl, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkylation or something else, but HCN addition is more likely.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd catalysts often are used for hydrogenation. So if B has a triple bond (from HCN addition?), then reduction would add hydrogen across the triple bond, making a single bond. Alternatively, if B is a nitrile, reduction would give an amine, but that's not matching the next steps.

Wait, HCN addition to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin—a compound with a CH(OH)CN group. So when you reduce that, maybe the hydroxyl gets converted to an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanide part is converted to an amine? Or maybe the cyanohydrin is being hydrogenated.

Wait, another possibility: A is a ketone. B would be the cyanohydrin (adding HCN to the carbonyl). Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the double bond in the cyanohydrin is reduced. Because a cyanohydrin has a structure like R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or maybe
