Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule's energy state transition when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. So, the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon it absorbs to go to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, so the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the next higher energy level. But wait, what's the structure of the energy levels here? I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotation and vibration.

Oh right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be described by the formula E = B J (J+1) + (something with vibration). Wait, I'm a bit mixed up. Let me think. Oh, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy is quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Since the molecule is in its fundamental state, that probably means v=0 and J=0. So the initial state is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next possible state. But wait, what's the order of energy levels? Vibrational levels are higher in energy than rotational, so if the molecule is in its ground state, the next energy increase could come from either a change in
