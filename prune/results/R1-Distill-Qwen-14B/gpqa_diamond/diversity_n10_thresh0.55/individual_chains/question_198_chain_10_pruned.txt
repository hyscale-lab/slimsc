Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in the formation of coordination complexes. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of ligands. So, the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

Wait, so Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n, where n can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The problem refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex. So, we're looking for the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} form.

The stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So:

β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, β3 for Co(SCN)₃, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄.

But wait, sometimes the stability constants are given per step. Like, the formation might be stepwise. So β1 is the first association (Co²+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)⁺), β2 is the second (Co(SCN)⁺ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)₂), and so on. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)₂ would be β1 * β2, right?

Wait, no. Wait, I think in this case, each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So for example, the
