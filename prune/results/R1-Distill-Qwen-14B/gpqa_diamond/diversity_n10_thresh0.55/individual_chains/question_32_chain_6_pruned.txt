Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach 0.96c. Hmm, interesting. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, the question states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 maybe? Because Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Yeah, that makes sense. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of this nucleus is 0.96c. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with speeds a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations.

The first thing I think is, what's the formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle? Oh right, it's E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. Plugging in v = 0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216
So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that math. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 indeed. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma becomes 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, that seems right.

But wait, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714? Wait, 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is about 3.5714. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Because E is gamma times m c squared. So what's the mass of Li-6?

The mass of a lithium-6 nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is known to be about 6.0151 grams per mole. Wait, but I need the mass in kilograms, right? Because standard units are in kg.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 g/mol. So the mass of one Li-6 nucleus is (6.0151 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number) * 1e-3 kg/g. Oh right, because grams to kilograms, so 6.0151 g is
