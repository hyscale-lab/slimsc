Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to a conjugate addition.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, especially when deprotonated. The base, NaOEt, would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. The enolate would then attack the β position of the α,β-unsaturated ester, which is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Wait, what's the structure of that acrylate? It's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl), but as an ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) with a methyl ester group. So the reactive part is the double bond between the two carbons, with the substituents on the β-carbon being the p-tolyl group.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the β-carbon (the CH2 part in the double bond) of the acrylate. So the malonate's enolate would add to the CH2, and the other part would connect, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. When deprotonated, the enolate is at the central CH. So adding that to the acrylate would create a new bond between the CH of the enolate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.

So the product would have the malonate part connected to the acrylate. Let me draw it out mentally. The acrylate has a structure like CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)OCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is CH2COOCH3- (attacking). Wait, actually, when the enolate attacks, the acrylate would have the structure where the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is CH
