Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack it.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how dark spots affect the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, which in turn affects the emission lines we observe.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Initially, without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but does the spot coverage affect the average temperature that way?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet, I think. And it's under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the Boltzmann equation applies.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels in atoms. The equation is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two levels is given by this equation. So when the temperature changes, this ratio changes as well.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So without spots, let's call the ratio R1, and with spots, R2. The question is asking R1/R2, the factor by which the ratio changes.

But wait, I need to think about what's changing. When the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So the effective temperature is lower. But wait, are we considering the temperature of the spots or the surrounding photosphere? I think the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the average T is lower, but actually, the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But if 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the overall photosphere's average T is 5500 K. Or maybe the photosphere's T is lower in the spots.

Wait, no. The problem says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the average effective temperature is lower. But the spots themselves are cooler. Let me think about the relation between spot coverage and effective temperature.

I think the effective temperature is a measure of the star's total luminosity. The star's luminosity is the sum of the contributions from the spotted and unspotted regions. So the effective temperature is determined by the total flux.

But for the purpose of this problem, the photospheric effective temperature (which is the Teff) has decreased to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So the average T is lower, but I'm not sure if the spots are at a lower T than the rest. But maybe for the calculation, I can consider that the photospheric temperature (the regions not covered by spots) is at 6000 K, and the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the problem says the "overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K". Hmm, maybe the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K. Or perhaps the entire photosphere's average T is 5500 K. Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, the spots are at a lower T, so the average T is somewhere between the two.

But perhaps the question is assuming that the temperature of the photosphere in the unspotted regions remains at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler. But that would complicate the spectral line analysis because we'd have to consider both regions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is
