Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break it down.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, there's an IR peak at 1720 cm-1.

Hmm, IR at 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So maybe the first reaction is an elimination or a substitution that forms a ketone. Wait, when dibromides react with a strong base like KOH, it's likely an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. But wait, wait. Alternatively, if two adjacent bromines are present, elimination could form a double bond. But wait, if it's a dihalide, maybe it's undergoing a double elimination to form an alkyne? Or perhaps a substitution reaction.

Wait, product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Maybe a ketone. Alternatively, if the reaction is an elimination to form a carbonyl, perhaps via a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the reaction forms a bridge or some kind of ring structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So the structure is something like a adamantane (which is a diamondoid, a four-fused cyclohexane rings) with Brs on carbons 1 and 3. When heated with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination reaction where each Br is replaced by an OH, but wait, that would form a diol. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so that's not likely. Wait, maybe it's an epoxide, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Brs) react with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh wait, wait, 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane could be across a bridge, so maybe when KOH is added, it eliminates to form a double bond, but that would be a diene or something else.

Wait, no, perhaps it's an intramolecular elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the Brs are replaced by something else. But wait, with KOH, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But since there are two Brs, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would form a diol. But the IR has a carbonyl, suggesting a ketone or ester.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. Wait, adamantane is a very rigid structure. So, perhaps substituting Brs with something else.

Wait, wait: the IR at 1720 could also be an ester or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde would be
