Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane means there are bromine atoms on the first and third positions.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. From what I recall, when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromides) react with strong bases, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal; the bromines are on 1 and 3, so they're not adjacent. Hmm, maybe the base isn't abstracting protons to eliminate HBr, but perhaps doing some other reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that each Br leaves, but with a base, perhaps leading to a double deprotonation and elimination of two HBr molecules. Oh wait, wait—what's the product here? The product is a light yellow solid. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like ester or ketone). The NMR spectrum has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be an OCH₂ group, maybe from an epoxide
