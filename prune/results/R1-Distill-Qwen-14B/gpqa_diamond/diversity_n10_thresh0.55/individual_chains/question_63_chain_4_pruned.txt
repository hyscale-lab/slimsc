Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the problem involves the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule consists of atoms X and Y. The given data includes their masses, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotational and vibrational motions. Oh, right, the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So the photon's energy must be equal to the energy difference between the two states. Momentum is related to photon energy through the equation p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy difference, I can find the momentum.

So what's the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state? Hmm. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit fuzzy on that). Wait, no, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states start at J=0, but the vibrational states start at n=0 as the ground state.

Wait, wait. The energy levels in the vibration-rotation model are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is the lowest, which is n=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would either be increasing J or increasing n. But since the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy," I think it's the next higher state, which might be the first excited vibrational state (n=1) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), or the same vibrational state with the next rotational state (J=1). But wait, which transition gives a lower energy? Or maybe I should think about the order of energy levels.

Vibrational energy levels are much higher than rotational. For example, the energy spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational. So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1 (
