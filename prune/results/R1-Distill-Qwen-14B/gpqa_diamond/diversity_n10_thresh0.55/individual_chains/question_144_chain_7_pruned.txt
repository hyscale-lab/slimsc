Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let's see. I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? And they're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are different distances in meters. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, I think the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime. Decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula I remember is something like L = c * τ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime.

But how do I find τ from the given parameters? Oh, right, the particle's width Γ is related to its lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the time uncertainty. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but let me think again. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, no, wait. I think when the width Γ is given, it's the total decay width. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but units can be tricky. Let me get the units right. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is given in MeV
