Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, quantum states and lifetimes... Oh right, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that there's a relationship between the energy of a state and its lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy is known, right? So if something has a longer lifetime, its energy is more certain, and a shorter lifetime means the energy is more uncertain or spread out.

The uncertainty principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes it's written with just the inequality, like ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the product of the energy uncertainty and the time (lifetime) should be at least ħ over 2.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be related to their lifetimes. Let me write that down. For the first state, ΔE1 is approximately ħ divided by (2 * τ1), where τ1 is the lifetime of 1e-9 seconds. Similarly, ΔE2 would be ħ/(2 τ2), with τ2 being 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but what about the energy difference between E1 and E2? I think the key is that the energy difference should be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties to clearly distinguish
