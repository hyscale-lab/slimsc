Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have atoms connected by a bond, and their movement can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to make the molecule switch to the next energy state.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the ground state. And we need to find the momentum of a photon it absorbs to jump to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm guessing that's the first excited state.

The given data includes masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. I remember that for rotation and vibration, different formulas apply.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Photons carry energy and momentum, and the energy is E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. The momentum p of a photon is E divided by c (speed of light), so p = E/c = hf/c. Alternatively, since E is also related to angular frequency, E = ħω, where ħ is h-bar (h/(2π)). So p would be (ħω)/c.

But wait, I think this is for the photon's momentum when it's absorbed. But why does the molecule's state change? Oh right, the photon's energy should match the energy difference between the states.

But wait, the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, which is a bit more complex than just vibration or rotation alone. So the energy levels have contributions from both rotation and vibration.

The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. The next state would be when either the vibrational quantum number increases, or the rotational quantum number increases, but since we're looking for the lowest possible energy jump, it's probably the smallest energy difference. So I think the next state would be the first vibrational excited state, n=1, because the energy difference for vibration is larger than for rotation. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: vibrational energy levels have larger spacing than rotational. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is higher than between rotational states. So perhaps the photon would cause a change in vibrational state.

Wait, wait. The question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition would be the smallest possible energy jump. So maybe it's a change in rotational state, but I need to consider both.

But the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh, right, it's a non-rigid rotor model. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies.

The fundamental state would have the lowest possible rotational and vibrational energies. So the next state could be either an increase in rotational quantum number (like J increases by 1) or an increase in vibrational quantum number (n increases by 1). But which requires less energy?

I think the vibrational energy levels have a much larger spacing than rotational levels. Let's calculate the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib between n=0 and n=1.

The formula for vibrational energy levels is E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħω. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω.

What about the rotational energy levels? The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, R is the bond length.

The reduced mass μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). Let me compute that.

Masses are given in amu. I need to convert them to kg. 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg.

mX = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3
