Okay, let's try to figure out this star detection question. Hmm, so the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I remember that these spectrographs have different magnitude limits. Let me check the details.

ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17 V. So, stars with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait—wait a second, the question says "brighter than 17 mag"—oh, right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star is brighter than 17, its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can detect stars where V ≤ 17, because brighter stars (smaller mag numbers) are easier to observe.

HIRES at Keck can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, the apparent magnitude must be ≤16. So both spectrographs can detect a star if the star's apparent V magnitude is ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So any star with V ≤ 16 can be detected by both, because HIRES can't go higher than 16, and ESPRESSO can. Wait, no, wait—if a star is 17, it's only detectable by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must be ≤16.

Wait, no, wait—the question says "stars with apparent V
