Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a certain type of nucleus to 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

First, the question says that the nucleus is X, defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium typically has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

The main goal is to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and velocity. The formula that comes to mind is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor. The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v is 0.96c, let me plug that in. So v² is (0.96c)^2. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714... Wait, wait, 1 divided by 0.28. Let me calculate that exactly. 1 / 0.28 is the same as 100/28, which simplifies to 25/7. 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, 0.28 is exactly 28/100, which is 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857...

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. Because the rest energy is mc², and the total energy is gamma multiplied by that.

The mass of Li-6: I think the atomic mass is around 6 grams per mole divided by Avogadro's number, but wait, maybe I should look up the actual mass. Alternatively, I can compute it from the known masses of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the nucleus consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So each proton is approximately 938, each neutron 939.565.

So let me calculate the total rest mass of Li-6.

3 protons: 3 * 938 =
