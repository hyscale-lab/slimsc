Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find their energy difference so they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the energy and lifetime of particles. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to h-bar over 2, where h-bar is Planck's constant divided by 2π.

So, ΔE * Δt ≈ h-bar / (2π), but often people just use ΔEΔt ≈ ħ/2. Wait, no, the exact formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

But another thing I remember is that the natural linewidth in spectroscopy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ), where τ is the lifetime of the state. So the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ΔE = ħ/(2τ). Let's compute that for both states.

First, for the state with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.055e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.275e-26 J.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states, not the uncertainty. Oh, right, because to distinguish between two states, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is less than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—they'd blur into one.

So, the energy difference ΔE_total between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait wait, no. Let me think again. Each state has its own uncertainty. So the total uncertainty in the system is on the order of the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the uncertainty in the energy difference. Because when you have two states, the uncertainty in measuring their energy difference would be the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or maybe that's not the case. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, to resolve two lines (which correspond to E1 and E2), the spacing between them (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their linewidths (uncertainties). Otherwise, the lines would overlap and you couldn't distinguish them.

So the condition is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.055e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.275e-26 J.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.055e-34) / (2e-8) ≈ 5.275e-26 / 10 = 5.275e-27 J.

Wait wait, τ2 is 1e-8, which is ten times τ1. So ΔE2 is 1/10 of ΔE1. So ΔE1 ≈ 5e-26 J, ΔE2 ≈ 5e-27 J.

Sum is about 5.5e-26 J.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be more than 5.5e-26 J.

But the options are given in eV. Oh right, so I need to convert Joules to eV.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.602e-19.

So, 5.5e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.43e-7 eV.

Wait, 5.5e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (5.5 / 1.6) * 1e-7 = about 3.43e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, that's 3.43e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be larger than that.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → much smaller than our 3.43e-7 eV? Wait, wait, wait: 3.43e-7 is 0.343e-6. So option A is 1e-9, which is 0.001e-6. That's much smaller, so not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 eV → 0.00001e-6 eV → even smaller, not enough.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 3.43e-7. So that's way bigger than needed.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 → 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, which is 1e-8 = 0.01e-6? Wait, 1e-8 is 0.01e-6? Wait, 1e-6 is a millionth, 1e-8 is a hundred millionth. So 1e-8 eV is 0.01e-6 eV. So that's larger than 3.43e-7, which is 0.343e-6. So 0.01e-6 is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.43e-7 (which is 3.43e-7 = 0.343e-6).

Wait, wait, 3.43e-7 is 0.343e-6 eV. So 1e-8 eV is 0.01e-6 eV. 0.01e-6 is smaller than 0.343e-6. So 1e-8 eV is too small. So the energy difference must be larger than 3.43e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger (1e-4 / 3.43e-7 is about 291), so that's way higher. So that would definitely be resolvable.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't get the exponents wrong.

Wait, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6.

So 3.43e-7 is about 0.343e-6 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 times larger. So that would be clearly distinguishable.

But wait, are the energy differences given in the options in the same terms? Let me recheck the options.

Options are A: 1e-9 eV, B:1e-11, C:1e-4, D:1e-8.

So the minimum required is about 3.43e-7 eV. So looking for an energy difference larger than that.

Option C is 1e-4, which is way bigger. So that would work.

Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.01e-6. That's smaller than 0.343e-6, so it wouldn't be enough.

So the correct option must be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should have considered the uncertainty in energy for each state separately, and then the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Because when you have two states with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the uncertainty in their separation would be ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute that.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.055e-34)/(2e-9) = 5.275e-26 J → 5.275e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

ΔE2 = (1.055e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.275e-26 /10 = 5.275e-27 J → 3.29e-8 eV.

So the sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be bigger than 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking back, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e4 * 3.62e-7 = about 291 times larger. So yes, that works.

But wait, the options given are A)1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8.

So which option is bigger than 3.62e-7 eV?

Looking at the options:

A: 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 0.000001 eV → way too small.

B: 1e-11 → 0.00000001 eV → nope.

C: 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4, which is 1e4 times larger than 3.62e-7. So yes, that's definitely larger.

D: 1e-8 → 0.00000001 eV → same as 1e-8, which is 0.00000001. Let's see, 3.62e-7 is 0.000000362. So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller. So not enough.

So the only option that's larger is C (1e-4 eV).

Wait, wait. Another approach: the uncertainty in the energy gives the minimum detectable difference. So the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be on the order of the uncertainty of the system. If you have two states, perhaps the uncertainty in their separation is the sum of their individual uncertainties. So the energy difference must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2).

So with the numbers: 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = 3.619e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

Looking at the options again, the only one that's higher is C) 1e-4 eV.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the uncertainty in energy is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert uncertainties to electron volts (eV)
Using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), we convert:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the minimum energy difference
To resolve the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} = 0.00001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is \( 1 \times 10^4 \) times larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). This is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
