Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down. The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about them moving or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, I should think about the electrostatic potential energy between them. Since these are point charges, the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. The formula is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But wait, this is a system of multiple charges. I think the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total. So for n charges, I have to consider all possible pairs.

Let me think about how many pairs there are. For 13 charges, the number of unique pairs is combination of 13 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2. So 13*12/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, in this setup, not all charges are moving around. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait a second, so the charges are arranged as one at the center (P) and twelve around it, each at a distance of 2 meters. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, and the distance between any two of the 12 charges? Oh, that's not given. Hmm, that's a problem because their mutual distances affect the potential energy. But wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so maybe all the 12 charges are fixed at their positions, and their mutual distances are such that they form a regular structure, like a regular dodecagon or something. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, considering that all the
