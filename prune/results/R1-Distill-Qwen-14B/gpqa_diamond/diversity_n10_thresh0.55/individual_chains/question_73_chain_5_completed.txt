Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. When they say relative speed, I think I need to calculate how fast one is moving with respect to the other. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds normally.

So the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, but wait, the direction matters. Oh wait, both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So subtracting v2 from v1, but I need to apply the formula.

Wait, no, the formula is when you have two frames. Let me make sure. The formula for when you want the velocity of an object in frame S' which is moving at velocity u relative to S. Hmm. Let me get the exact formula right. Oh right, the formula is (v' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)) ). So in this case, if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as the second's 0.5c, then the relative speed of the first as seen by the second would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)].

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the numerator. Since the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c, from their perspective, the first astronaut (moving at 0.6c) would be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by the denominator. Let me compute that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6 *0.5) since c² cancels. So 0.6 times 0.5 is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.142857, so about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c, and D has the same. So that's probably the relative speed part.

Now for the total energy of the system. The question is, what's the total energy when considering both astronauts. Wait, energy in relativity is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So I need to calculate the rest energy for each astronaut, multiply by their respective gamma factors, and sum them.

So astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², option B says E=4.96. So that matches with C's E.

Wait, but wait. What if the question is considering the system as a whole from the perspective of the rest frame? Because in that case, the energies are just additive, but perhaps they are considering the center of momentum frame or something else. But no, the problem says "the total energy of the system" and the astronauts are moving in the same direction, so the system's total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

So putting it together, the relative speed is about 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options:

Option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct option.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
