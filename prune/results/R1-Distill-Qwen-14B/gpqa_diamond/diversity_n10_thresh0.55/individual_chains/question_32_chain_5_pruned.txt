Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that the number of neutrons affects the mass, so I'll need to figure out the mass of this nucleus first.

Let me start by recalling the basics. The energy of a particle in a collider is usually given by the relativistic energy formula. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity here.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, right, so first I need to calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me compute beta first, which is v/c. So beta is 0.96. Then, beta squared is 0.96^2. Let me calculate that: 0.96 * 0.96. Well, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So, 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is ... let me think. The square of 0.28 is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let's calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute 28 into 100. 28*3=84, 28*3.5=98, oh wait, 28*3.5714 ≈100? Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 28 * 3.5714 = 28*(3 + 0.5714) = 84 + (28 * 0.5714). What's 28 * 0.5714? 28 * 0.5 is 14, 28 * 0.0714 is approximately 2 (since 28 * 0.07 is 1.96, and 28 * 0.0014 is about 0.0392; so 1.96 + 0.0392 = 1.9992). So 14 + 1.9992 is approximately 16. So 28*3.5714 is roughly 84 + 16 = 100. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but wait, I might have miscalculated that. Let me do it more accurately. Let me compute 1/0.28. 0.28 is the denominator. So 1 / 0.28 is equal to (100 / 28) = approximately 3.5714. So yeah, gamma is about 3.5714.

So gamma is 3.5714. Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Li has an atomic number of 3, which is the number of protons. So, the isotope Li-6 since 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of Li-6 would be needed here.

Wait, but
