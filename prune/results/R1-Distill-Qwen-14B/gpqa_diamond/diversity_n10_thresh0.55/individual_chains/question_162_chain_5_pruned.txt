Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that seems a bit unusual. Oh wait, I remember that in 2D spacetime, the metric can describe different geometries. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a 2D surface with constant negative curvature. Or wait, maybe it's a sphere if the curvature is positive. Hmm, no, pseudosphere is a term I associate with negative curvature, like a saddle shape.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2. Wait, but I thought pseudospheres are typically infinite in extent, but maybe in this context, it's a finite area? Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the metric. The general form of a 2D metric in coordinates (x,y) is something like ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So in this case, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm, what does that tell me about the geometry?

Wait, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So the metric blows up when 4 - x² - y² approaches zero, which would be when x² + y² approaches 4. So that's a circle of radius 2 (since 2² is 4) in the x-y plane. So maybe the metric is defined everywhere except where x²
