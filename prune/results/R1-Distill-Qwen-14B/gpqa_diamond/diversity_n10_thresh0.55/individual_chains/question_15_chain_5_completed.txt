Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says we've got two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law. Oh right, shorter period means closer orbit.

The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have the same radii. So same size stars, but different masses. But for transit probability, I think the star's radius is a key factor. Because the probability depends on the ratio (Rp / R*), where Rp is planet radius and R* is star radius.

Wait, but the question says both planets have Earth-like masses. Oh, but Earth's radius is fixed. Wait no, wait, the question says they have the same masses, but I'm not sure about their radii. Wait, no, the question is about transit probability. So I need to think about the likelihood of the planet's path crossing our line of sight, which depends on the orbital inclination. But the transit probability is also influenced by the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R* / a) * (1 / sin(i)), where i is the inclination, but I'm probably mixing up the formula. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (Rp / R*) multiplied by (R* / a), or something like that. Wait, maybe the probability is (R*/a) * (some factor). Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R*/a) * (sqrt(1 - e^2))/(1 - e), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), this simplifies. So for a circular orbit, the probability is (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2))) but e=0, so it's R* / a.

Wait, no, maybe the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (something else). Let me think. The transit probability, P, is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit. So it's (π R_earth^2) / (π a^2), but that's not exactly right because the planet's size isn't the only factor. Wait, no. The probability is the ratio of the star's disk area to the planet's orbital area, but wait, no. The transit probability is actually the fraction of the orbit where the planet could pass in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (something)). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is given by (R* + Rp) / a, but since Rp is much smaller than R*, it's approximately R* / a. So the higher R* is and the lower a is (closer orbit), the higher the probability.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius (R* same for both). So the probability depends on 1/a, where a is the orbital distance. Since a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law, which states that a^3 ∝ (M_star) * P^2. So for a given star mass and period, a is determined.

So for each planet, a can be calculated using a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4 π²). But since both planets are around stars with different masses, their a's will differ.

Let me think: Planet_1 has a period P1, Planet_2 has P2 = 3 * P1 (because period of Planet_1 is three times shorter). Host star of Planet_1 (Star_1) has mass M1 = 2 * M2 (M2 is mass of Star_2). So Star_1 is more massive.

Using Kepler's third law: a^3 ∝ M * P^2. So a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2)/(4 π²), and a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2)/(4 π²).

Given that P2 = 3 P1 and M1 = 2 M2, let's substitute.

a2^3 = G * M2 * (3 P1)^2 / (4 π²) = G M2 9 P1² / (4 π²).

a1^3 = G (2 M2) P1² / (4 π²) = 2 G M2 P1² / (4 π²).

So a2^3 = (9/2) a1^3 → a2 = (9/2)^(1/3) a1.

Wait, let me compute (9/2)^(1/3). 9/2 is 4.5. Cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Because a is the orbital radius, so a1 is smaller than a2. So since the probability is R* / a, and R* is the same for both stars, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so the transit probability is higher.

So transit probability P1 is R*/a1 and P2 is R*/a2. Since a2 = 1.65 a1, P2 = (R*)/(1.65 a1) = (R*/a1) * (1/1.65) = P1 * (1/1.65).

So P1 is higher. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of 1.65.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher than that.

Wait, let me recheck the math.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me write this again.

We have:

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2)/(4 π²)
a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2)/(4 π²)

Given that P2 = 3 P1, and M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting P2 and M2 into a2's equation:

a2^3 = G (M2) (3 P1)^2 / (4 π²) = G M2 9 P1^2 / (4 π²)
a1^3 = G (2 M2) P1^2 / (4 π²) = 2 G M2 P1^2 / (4 π²)

So a2^3 = (9/2) * (G M2 P1^2 )/(4 π²)

Which is 4.5 times the value of a1^3. So a2 = a1 * (4.5)^(1/3).

What is cube root of 4.5? Let's compute it numerically. 4.5 is 9/2.

Cube root of 9 is approx 2.08, cube root of 2 is 1.26. So cube root of 9/2 is approximately 2.08/1.26 ≈ 1.65.

Yes, so a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Thus, a1 is smaller, so R*/a1 is larger than R*/a2 by a factor of 1.65.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which depends on the ratio of the star's radius \( R_* \) to the planet's orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability of a transit depends inversely on the orbital distance \( a \). A shorter orbital period and a more massive host star both result in a smaller \( a \), increasing the transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the star's mass and \( P \) is the planet's orbital period, we calculate the orbital distances for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 \), while Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 3P_1 \). The host star of Planet_1 has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), where \( M_2 \) is the mass of the host star of Planet_2. Substituting these values:

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{G M_1 P_1^2}{4\pi^2}, \quad a_2^3 = \frac{G M_2 P_2^2}{4\pi^2}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 3P_1 \) and \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), we find:

\[
a_2^3 = \frac{G M_2 (3P_1)^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{9G M_2 P_1^2}{4\pi^2}.
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{G (2M_2) P_1^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{2G M_2 P_1^2}{4\pi^2}.
\]

Taking the ratio:

\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{9/2} = 4.5 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (4.5)^{1/3} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

From the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the factor is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct, as Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the factor is not 2.7.

The researchers should observe Planet_1 due to its higher transit probability.
