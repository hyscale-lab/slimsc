Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the initial step is mixing the acetic acid with water. Since we're adding equal volumes, the concentration should change.

So, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution. The formula is C1V1 = C2V2. Here, the volume doubles, so the concentration should be halved.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M. Mixing with equal volume (20 cm³ each), so total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. So I need to find the equivalence point first.

How do I find the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence? The initial moles of acetic acid will determine that. The volume of the diluted solution is 40 cm³ (20+20), concentration 0.025 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH needed is same as moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is 10 cm³ of NaOH. At 25% titration, we've added 25% of 10 cm³ → 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, so at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added to 40 cm³ of acetic acid solution. Now, let's find the pH at this point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me calculate the moles.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So the reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And acetate is 0.00025 mol.

The total volume now is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is about 4.26.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 0.00075 / 0.
