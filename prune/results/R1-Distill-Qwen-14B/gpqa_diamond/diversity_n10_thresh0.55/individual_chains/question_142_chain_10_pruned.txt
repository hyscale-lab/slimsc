Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what exactly is this matrix telling me?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me make sure I parse that correctly. Oh right, each term is an outer product. So each |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, same for |1><1|. So adding those together and multiplying by 1/2.

Let me compute that. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Multiply that by 1/2, and ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So it's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Wait, but what does this represent? Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It can also be seen as the completely mixed state, which is like a classical mixture of |0> and |1> with equal probabilities. So it's not a pure state because the trace of ρ squared isn't 1. Let me check: ρ squared is [[ (1/2)^2, 0 ], [0, (1/2)^2 ] ] which is [[1/4, 0], [0, 1/4]]. The trace is 1/2, so yeah, not pure.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center, I think.

Wait, how does the Bloch vector work? Each qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. For a general state |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>, the Bloch vector is [x, y, z] where x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, z = cosθ. But wait, that's for pure states. For mixed states, it's a bit different.

Wait no, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general density matrix for a single qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So in this case, our ρ is (I)/2. Because when you expand (I + r·σ)/2, if r is zero, you get I/2.

So if ρ is I/2, then r must be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the center of the sphere. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which would be the correct answer. Let me check the other options just in case.

Option A: (1,1,0) — that would be somewhere on the Bloch sphere, but the components here would have a magnitude of sqrt(2), which is larger than 1, so that can't be right because the Bloch vector components can't exceed 1 in magnitude.

Option B: (0,0,1) — that's the north pole of the Bloch sphere, which would be the state |0>. But our state is a mixed state
