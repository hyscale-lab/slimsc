Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm. So, I'm thinking this is an electrostatic potential energy problem because all the charges are stationary, and we're looking for the potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, there's no external work to consider, just the interactions between the charges themselves.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the fixed charge, right? But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because they're all at the same point P distance from the 13th, but their positions relative to each other matter too.

Wait, no. The 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, each of those 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. But their distance from each other can vary, but in this case, perhaps they are all at the same point, but that can't be because they can't all be at the same point if they are constrained to 2m from P. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are each located 2 meters away from point P, but their positions are arranged in a way that they're all at 2m from P, forming a sphere or something, but their mutual distances are something we can arrange. But to minimize the potential energy, we might need to consider their arrangement.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the minimum energy of the system." So, we're looking for the configuration that gives the least (most negative) potential energy. Because potential energy is lowest (most negative) when like charges are as close as possible, right? But wait, in this case, all the charges are positive, since each is 2e. Because e is positive (elementary charge), so 2e is positive.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think: the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2m away from P. Each of these 12 has charge 2e. So, the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e, so they're all positive. So, to minimize the potential energy, we need to arrange the 12 charges as close as possible to each other, because that would create the maximum repulsion, hence the most negative potential energy.

Ah, but what's the minimum possible energy? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the potential energy between two charges is given by U = k * (q1 q2) / r. So, when like charges are placed closer together, the potential energy becomes more negative, which is lower. So, the lower the potential energy, the more stable the system is. So, to get
