Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I think this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's only got dx and dy. So it's describing some kind of space with coordinates x and y. Oh, right, in two dimensions, this would be a surface, maybe something like a sphere or a pseudosphere.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere. So the metric probably has negative curvature. But I'm not sure how to tell that directly from the metric. Maybe by looking at the form of the line element.

The standard metric for a sphere in 2D is ds² = (r²/(1 + (r²/(4a²))(x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. Let me think about that.

The Poincaré disk model has the metric ds² = (4/( (1 - x² - y²)^2 )) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's similar to what's given here. Let me compare. In our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 3
