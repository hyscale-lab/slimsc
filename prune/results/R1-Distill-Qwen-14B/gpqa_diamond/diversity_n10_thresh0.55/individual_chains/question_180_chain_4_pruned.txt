Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves charges and energy in an isolated system. 

Alright, the problem states there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice the charge of a proton. And their mass is negligible, so I can probably ignore any kinetic energy considerations and focus purely on electric potential energy.

The setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. 

Wait, so the 13th charge is at point P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters from the central charge, which is the 13th one.

I think the minimum energy would occur when the system is in the most stable configuration. Since all charges are the same, they'll all be of the same sign, right? Because if they were opposite, some might attract and others might repel. But wait, since all are 2e, they're all positive or all negative? Well, electric potential energy depends on the sign of the charges. If all are positive, then each pair would repel, leading to higher potential energy. Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy," which is the lowest possible potential energy. Hmm, wait a minute, but for like charges, the potential energy increases with distance because they repel. So
