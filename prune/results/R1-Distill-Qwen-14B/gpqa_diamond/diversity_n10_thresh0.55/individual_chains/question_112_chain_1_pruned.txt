Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize this state because when it says "proportional", it doesn't necessarily mean it's normalized. So normalization is the first step.

The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So these are the standard basis states, and I can represent |alpha> as a vector in this 2D space.

Let me write |alpha> as a vector. So, the components are (1+i, 2-i). Wait, no, wait—because when you write |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, the vector is [a; b]. So here, a is (1+i) and b is (2-i). So the vector is [1+i, 2-i]^T.

But to find the probabilities, I need the state to be normalized. So the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let me compute that.

|a|^2 is |1+i|^2. The modulus squared of a complex number is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

|b|^2 is |2-i|^2. 2^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the actual |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Next part of the question: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A, where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would be:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, because when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Hmm
