Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity... I remember that method uses the Doppler shift to detect planets. So when a star has a planet orbiting it, the planet's gravity makes the star wobble, causing the spectral lines to shift a tiny bit. The shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says both host stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with masses like Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things.

Planet #1's spectral line shifted by 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shifted by 7. I'm trying to remember how the shift relates to the planet's properties. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is the measure of this shift. So K is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the star's mass, right? But wait, since both stars have the same mass, that factor would cancel out when comparing K for both planets.

But wait, the formula for K is K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star + M_p)^(1/3)} ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Oh wait, the RV method relates the star's velocity to the planet's orbit.

Another approach: the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/ P) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, eccentricity e is zero, so that term is 1. And since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_* ) )^(1/3) ) / ( P^(1/3) ) ) * something... Wait, maybe I should think about the formula K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (P)^(1/3)) ) ). Hmm, perhaps that's getting too detailed.

Wait, another thought: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2
