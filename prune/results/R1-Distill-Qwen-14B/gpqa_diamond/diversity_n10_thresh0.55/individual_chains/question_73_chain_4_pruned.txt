Okay, so I've got this physics problem about relativistic speeds and energy. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts, their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, when dealing with relativity, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics. I remember that velocities don't just add up normally when they're that high. So for the relative speed, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

But wait, the relative speed in this context... Let me clarify. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's velocity? Or is it the other way around? Oh, but the question says "relative speed", so it's the speed of one as seen from the other. Let's pick A and B. So if A is moving at 0.6c, what's B's speed relative to A?

Wait no, actually, I think the formula is for when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then an object moving at v in S would have a velocity v' in S' given by (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/cÂ²).

So in this case
