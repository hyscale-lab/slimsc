Okay, so I've got this problem here about crystal planes and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal lattice where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles between them are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a cubic structure would be the edge length a. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters might be a bit different. Oh, right, because the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees.

The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) multiplied by some factor involving the angles. Wait, more specifically, I think the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) multiplied by [ (1 + cos α)/2 + (1 + cos β)/2 + (1 + cos γ)/2 ] when the structure is rhombohedral. Or maybe it's a different formula. 

Wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think. Oh right, for a general rhombohedral system where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the interplanar
