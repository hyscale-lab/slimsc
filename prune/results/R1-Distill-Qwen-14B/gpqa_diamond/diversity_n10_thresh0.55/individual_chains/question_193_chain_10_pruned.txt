Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are all in terms of how N depends on r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is the inverse of parallax (plx in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, it's d = 1 / plx, where plx is in arcseconds. So if parallax increases, the distance decreases, right? Because higher parallax means closer stars.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me express N in terms of d. Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is equal to d^5, right? Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and taking reciprocal gives d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So N is proportional to d^5. So if distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, the options are about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Hmm, I think I might have gotten confused. Because N is the total number, but the question is about how it changes with r, which I think is the distance variable. Wait, maybe the question is about the number of stars in a shell between r and r+dr, so like the differential number of stars. Because if N is the number in a region, how does the density change with distance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number per unit volume. Let me think again. The number of stars as a function of parallax
