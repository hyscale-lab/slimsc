Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one, NaCN, and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, I remember that reactions with ketones and nitriles might involve some nucleophilic addition or substitution. Let me think. The first reaction starts with butan-2-one, which is a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, what's happening here? Oh right, that looks like the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation typically involves a ketone reacting with cyanide ions in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Wait, so butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. But for the cyanohydrin formation, you usually need an acid catalyst. So reagent A is probably that acid. The options for A in the choices are H3O+ and NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, so it could help in protonating the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

Looking at the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. So if A is H3O+, that would make sense. That's option A or B. If A was NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3- ions, perhaps that's a different scenario. Wait, but HSO3- is a weaker acid than H3O+. NaHSO3 is more of a mild acid, maybe for other reactions like epimerization or something else.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and the product is a butanoic acid with the same substituent. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

The typical way to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids is through hydrolysis. But the conditions matter. Nitrile hydrolysis can be done
