Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it's about. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it there's a small cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and it's not centered at the conductor's center because the distance between the centers is s. Oh, and r is smaller than R, so the cavity is entirely within the conductor.

Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are bigger than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor is uncharged, any charge introduced inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. But wait, because the cavity isn't centered, the induced charges might not be symmetric. Hmm, but wait, the conductor is a sphere. Oh, but the position of the cavity affects the induced charges.

Wait, but the conductor is a sphere, so regardless of where the charge is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution would be uniform because the conductor is a sphere. Because any internal charges in a spherical conductor would induce charges on the inner surface, but the outer surface would have a uniform distribution since the conductor itself is symmetric. Oh wait, but the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we add charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor was uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's walls) must have -q, which then would make the outer surface have +q, since the total conductor's charge is zero. Or wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So placing +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to be -q, so the outer surface must be +q to make the total conductor's charge zero. Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. If the inner surface is -q, then the outer must be +q to make the total zero? Because the conductor's initial charge is zero. So yes, the outer surface would have +q. 

But wait, the cavity is not centered, so would the outer surface still be symmetric? Hmm, since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution regardless of where the charge inside is placed. Because the conductor's outer surface would adjust to maintain the overall charge on the conductor. But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the outer surface is +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the conductor's total charge is (-q) + (+q) = 0. But wait, no, because when you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface becomes -q, but the conductor's outer surface must carry +q to balance, because the conductor's net charge is zero. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The conductor is initially neutral. When you place +q inside the cavity (which is inside the conductor), the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the +q in the cavity will attract -q on the inner surface. Then, the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. The inner is -q, so the outer must be +q to make the conductor's total charge zero. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the problem says the conductor is uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor (outer surface) must be zero because it was uncharged. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor itself doesn't have any net charge; the charges are on the surfaces. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor becomes -q, and the outer surface becomes +q. So the conductor's net charge is zero (because inner is -q, outer is +q). Oh, I see. So the outer surface has +q, but the conductor's overall charge is zero because the inner is -q and the outer is +q.

Wait, but I thought the conductor was uncharged. So putting a charge inside the cavity would cause it to have induced charges, but the conductor's net charge remains zero. So the outer surface must have +q, and the inner surface -q. 

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P is due to all the charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface that includes P. But since P is outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface would include the conductor. Now, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the Gaussian surface would enclose all the charge inside the conductor, which is the +q on the outer surface.

Wait, but wait. The conductor's outer surface is a spherical shell with radius R, and it's uniformly charged with +q. So the electric field outside the conductor (since P is outside) would be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center. That's because for a spherical shell with charge Q, the field outside is Q/(4πε₀ r²). So in this case, since the outer surface has +q, the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but the options are given. Let me check the options. Option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's what I'm thinking. But wait, why are the other options there? Let me think again.

The position of the cavity and the point P's distance to the cavity's center is l, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the cavity's location (s) and the angle theta may not affect the electric field outside, because the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged. The field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center, L.

Wait, but wait, the Gaussian surface is outside the conductor, so all the induced charges (inner and outer) contribute. But the inner charges are inside the conductor, and for a Gaussian surface outside, the enclosed charge is the sum of inner and outer charges. Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q, and the inner has -q. So the Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose +q (from the outer surface) and the point is outside, so the field is due to the +q on the outer surface.

So the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². So looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but some of the other options involve l and s. Why would they be there? Oh, perhaps if the conductor wasn't a sphere. But in this case, it's a sphere, so the outer surface is symmetric, so the field depends only on the total enclosed charge. So s and l shouldn't matter.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's walls). To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The point $P$ is located outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, $+q$. The field is independent of the position or distribution of the charge inside the cavity, as the conductor's outer surface ensures a symmetric charge distribution.

3. **Gaussian Surface and Field Calculation**:  
   Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at $P$ is determined by the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface (the outer surface of the conductor). The field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of Other Parameters**:  
   The parameters $l$ (distance from $P$ to the cavity's center), $s$ (distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity), and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$) do not affect the electric field at $P$ because the conductor's outer surface is uniformly charged, and the field outside depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Among the given options, the one that matches the derived expression is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
