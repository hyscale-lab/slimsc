Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out where the given density matrix is located in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Right, density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since this is ρ, I should probably find its position in the Bloch sphere or maybe the qubit space representation.

Wait, qubit space is usually represented by a vector in a three-dimensional space, right? The Bloch vector has components (x, y, z), and any single-qubit state can be written as (x, y, z) where x² + y² + z² = 1 for a pure state. But wait, this ρ might not be a pure state. Let me check that.

A pure state density matrix has trace 1 and is idempotent (ρ² = ρ). Let me compute the trace of ρ. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So the diagonal elements are (1/2, 1/2), so the trace is 1. So that's correct. But is it a pure state?

Alternatively, I can compute the eigenvalues. The matrix |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, same with |1><1|. So adding them gives a diagonal matrix [1, 1], then multiplied by 1/2, so the diagonal becomes [1/2, 1/2]. The eigenvalues are 1/2 and 1/2. So the eigenvalues are equal. That suggests it's a mixed state because for a pure state, one eigenvalue would be 1 and the other 0.

Wait, but wait another moment. Actually, if a density matrix has equal eigenvalues, like both 1/2 here, that implies it's a completely mixed state. For a single qubit, the completely mixed state is (I/2), which is what we have here. So ρ = I/2. So that's the maximally mixed state.

Now, how is this represented in the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = (x, y, z), where x = Tr(ρ X), y = Tr(ρ Y), z = Tr(ρ Z), with X, Y, Z being the Pauli matrices.

So let me compute each component.

X = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

First, compute Tr(ρ X). Let's compute ρ first. ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements 1/2.

Now, ρ X would be (1/2) |0><0| X + (1/2) |1><1| X.

But |0><0| X is [[0,1],[0,0]], and |1><1| X is [[0,0],[1,0]]. So adding them, you get [[0,1],[1,0]], but multiplied by 1/2. So ρ X is (1/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as (X)/2.

Wait, but wait, actually, maybe I should compute X multiplied by ρ. Because Tr(ρ X) is the trace of ρ multiplied by X, not X multiplied by ρ. Because the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, Tr(AB)=Tr(BA).

Wait, so ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is diagonal [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ρ X is [[ (1/2)(0), (1/2)(1) ], [ (1/2)(1), 0 ] ].

So ρ X = [[0, 1/2],[1/2, 0]].

The trace of ρ X is the sum of the diagonal elements: 0 + 0 = 0.

Similarly, Tr(ρ Y). Let's compute Y: [[0, -i],[i,0]].

ρ Y is (1/2) |0><0| Y + (1/2)|1><1| Y.

But |0><0| Y is [[0, 0], [0, 0]] because |0><0| is diagonal, and multiplying by Y (off-diagonal) would give zero. Similarly, |1><1| Y is also zero. So ρ Y is zero matrix. So Tr(ρ Y) is 0.

Tr(ρ Z) is Tr( (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) Z ). Z is diagonal, so |0><0| Z is |0><0|, and |1><1| Z is -|1><1|. So ρ Z is (1/2)( |0><0| - |1><1| ) which is [[1/2, 0], [0, -1/2]]. The trace is 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0.

So the Bloch vector components x, y, z are all zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0). So that's the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, the origin is the completely mixed state, which makes sense because ρ is (I/2), the maximally mixed state.

Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct answer would be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we compute the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \), where the components are given by:

\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho X), \quad y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y), \quad z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z),
\]

with \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) being the Pauli matrices.

### Step 1: Compute \( \rho \)
The density matrix \( \rho \) is diagonal with elements \( \frac{1}{2} \) on the diagonal:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( x = \text{Tr}(\rho X) \)
The Pauli \( X \)-matrix is \( X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). Multiplying \( \rho \) and \( X \), we get:
\[
\rho X = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The trace of \( \rho X \) is the sum of the diagonal elements:
\[
x = \text{Tr}(\rho X) = 0 + 0 = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y) \)
The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix is \( Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). Since \( \rho \) is diagonal and \( Y \) is off-diagonal, the product \( \rho Y \) is zero:
\[
\rho Y = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Thus:
\[
y = \text{Tr}(\rho Y) = 0.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z) \)
The Pauli \( Z \)-matrix is \( Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \). Multiplying \( \rho \) and \( Z \), we get:
\[
\rho Z = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The trace of \( \rho Z \) is:
\[
z = \text{Tr}(\rho Z) = \frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0.
\]

### Step 5: Bloch vector
The Bloch vector is:
\[
\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0).
\]

### Conclusion
The density matrix \( \rho \) corresponds to the origin in qubit space, which represents the completely mixed state. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** \( (1,1,0) \): Incorrect.
- **B)** \( (0,0,1) \): Incorrect.
- **C)** \( (0,0,0) \): Correct.
- **D)** \( (1,1,1) \): Incorrect.
