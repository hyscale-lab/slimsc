Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, such that it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation is given by Aij. Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Then, find the average value of that operator. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. First, I should find the state |alpha> normalized. Because it's proportional to that given combination, I'll need to normalize it.

So, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the norm. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i). Wait, wait. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2, because |a|² + |b|² is the squared norm for a state a|up> +b|down> when |up> and |down> are orthonormal.

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|² is a² + b². So, 1² +1²=2.

Similarly, |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, since the basis is |up> and |down>, the matrix is 2x2. Let me write it:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no. Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal ones are hbar/2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, operators are usually Hermitian, right? Because they represent observables. But wait, looking at the matrix, it's anti-symmetric. Because A_12 = (hbar/2), A_21 = (hbar/2). Wait, no, A_ij is same for i≠j. So for a 2x2, the matrix would be:

0   hbar/2
hbar/2   0

Wait, but that's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian. Because A_ij = A_ji*, but in this case, A_ij is real, so it's symmetric. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of such a matrix can be found. Let me think, the eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) =0.

So the matrix is:

[-λ   hbar/2
 hbar/2   -λ ]

Determinant is λ² - (hbar²/4) =0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait, so the operator's eigenstates are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, because the operator looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, the
