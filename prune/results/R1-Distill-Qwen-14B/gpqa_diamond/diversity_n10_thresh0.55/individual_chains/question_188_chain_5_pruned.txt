Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

First, let me remember what a rhombohedral crystal looks like. I think it's a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait, no, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic, right? Or maybe not? Wait, no—rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is actually a form where all the edges are equal, and all the face angles are 60 degrees, but in this case, the angles are given as 30 degrees each. So maybe it's a special case.

Wait, no, the rhombohedral system has all a, b, c equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all equal too. But in this problem, the angles are 30 degrees each. So it's a rhombohedral structure with a =
