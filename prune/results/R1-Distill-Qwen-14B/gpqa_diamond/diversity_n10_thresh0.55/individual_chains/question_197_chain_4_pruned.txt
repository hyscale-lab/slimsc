Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay.

First, let's look at the spectral data given. The IR shows strong peaks. The first peak is in the 3400–2500 cm-1 region, which I think usually corresponds to O-H stretches (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H. But the other strong IR peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indicator, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1610 and 1450 might be related to conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings. Wait, aromatic C=C stretching is around 1450–1600 cm-1. So maybe the compound is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. Let's break down the peaks:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. High chemical shift, which makes me think of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, sometimes aldehydic protons are around 9-10, but that's usually a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange broadened peak, like an -OH. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH would have a broad peak, maybe around 12 ppm? Hmm, not sure. Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually very broad and around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 ppm fits that. But wait, if it's a ketone, why the high peak in NMR? Maybe it's something else.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually deshielded and appear as a
