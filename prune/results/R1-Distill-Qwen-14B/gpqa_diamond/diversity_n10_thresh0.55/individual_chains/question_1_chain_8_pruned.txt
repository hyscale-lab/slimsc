Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me two energy states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. I'm supposed to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two levels.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy and lifetime of a state. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The energy uncertainty is related to the inverse of the lifetime. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But sometimes people approximate it as ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt, ignoring the constant factor.

So the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt). The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be determined. For very short lifetimes, the energy is less precisely known.

In this problem, we have two states with different lifetimes. But wait, how does that relate to the energy difference between them? Oh wait, the question is about resolving two distinct energy levels. To clearly distinguish two states, the energy difference ΔE between them should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the uncertainty is comparable to the energy difference, you can't tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2, where τ is the lifetime. The maximum uncertainty would be the larger of the two, because whichever has the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. Or wait, no. If the states are E1 and E2, maybe the relevant uncertainty is the minimum of the two? Because the measurement has to be precise enough to resolve the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let's think more carefully. Suppose we have two states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are τ1 and τ2. The uncertainty in each energy is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/τ1 and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/τ2. To resolve E1 and E2, the separation ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps the larger uncertainty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each state's energy is known to within their own uncertainties. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, ΔE2
