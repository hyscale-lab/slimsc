Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the concepts involved here.

First, I remember that when a medium is moving, it can affect the observed speed of light within that medium, but I'm not exactly sure how. I recall that the index of refraction, n, is related to the speed of light in the medium. Normally, in a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But this is when the medium isn't moving relative to the observer.

Wait, but in this problem, the glass is moving. So how does that affect things? I think I need to consider how velocities add in different reference frames, maybe using special relativity. But wait, the glass is moving at v, which I assume is much smaller than the speed of light, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I can treat it using the Galilean transformation since v is small, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, no, the speed of light in any inertial frame should still be c according to special relativity. But I'm a bit confused because the problem is about the speed of light in the glass, which is a medium. So I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me try to break it down. Normally, the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But since the glass is moving, I might need to adjust for that motion relative to the lab frame.

Wait, when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light in the medium doesn't just add the velocities in a simple way. Because light is electromagnetic waves, and their speed is dependent on the medium's properties as well as the motion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this by considering the medium's motion and how it affects the speed of light according
