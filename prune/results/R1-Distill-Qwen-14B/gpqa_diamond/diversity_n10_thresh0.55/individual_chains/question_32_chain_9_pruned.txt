Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not super clear on the specifics. The question is about finding the energy when the speed is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, Li with 3 neutrons – that's lithium-6, right? Because lithium has 3 protons normally, so adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons in total. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Alright, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases. So the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; we need to use the relativistic formulas.

The formula for the total energy of a particle is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, is the energy given here the kinetic energy or the total energy? Because sometimes people mix those up. The question says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or does it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem statement says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So I think
