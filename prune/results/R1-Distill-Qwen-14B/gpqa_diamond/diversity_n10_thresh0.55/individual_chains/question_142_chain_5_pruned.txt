Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projections (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so their density matrices have a trace of 1 and are positive semi-definite.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit density matrix? Oh right, for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a 2x2 matrix. A general qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So the given ρ here is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s in the top-left and 0 elsewhere, except the diagonal. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 0s except the bottom-right. So adding them would give a diagonal matrix with 1s in both diagonal positions. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 0.5.

So ρ is a 2x2 matrix:
[0.5 0
0 0.5]

Wait, I remember that the density matrix can also be written in terms of the Blo
