Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. Let me break down the given information.

1. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an element with a heavier isotope. Maybe it's something like chlorine, which has a common isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or perhaps another element with multiple isotopes.

2. X reacts violently with liquid Y. I'm thinking maybe Y is water (H2O) or perhaps another liquid like an alcohol or something else. Violent reactions could be like a metal reacting with water, but I'm not sure yet.

3. The reaction releases gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm. So each molecule of W has an equal number of n and p. The only atoms I can think of where n equals p are those with atomic number 1 (H), 2 (He), 6 (C-12), 8 (O-16), etc. Wait, but the molecule is a gas, so perhaps it's something like H2O, but no, H2O has 8 neutrons in oxygen and 1 in each H. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a molecule like CO2? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the gas
