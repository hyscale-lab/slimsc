Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, the star itself moves a bit in the opposite direction, causing the spectral lines to shift periodically. The size of that shift depends on the mass of the planet and how close it is to the star, I think.

The question says there are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. They each have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. So, same star masses and same planet masses. Both planets have circular orbits. 

For planet #1, the spectral line shift is 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but the question is about the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So, how does the shift relate to the orbital period?

I think the shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ), but wait, since M_p is much less than M_star, the denominator is approximately 1. So K ≈ (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * ( (1 AU) / a )^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, the RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude K, which depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). But since M_p is much less than M_star, it's approximately K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ). 

Wait, so K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period P. Because K = (something) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)). So, if K is larger, then P is smaller. Because K is inversely proportional to P
