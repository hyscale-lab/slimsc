Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and time measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the exact formula might vary based on the exact formulation. Sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, and sometimes just ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the context. I think for this problem, using ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt might be the way to go, especially since we're looking for the minimum detectable energy difference.

So the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of the states. I suppose the uncertainty in time Δt is related to the lifetime of the state. If the lifetime is shorter, the uncertainty in energy would be higher, making it harder to distinguish small energy differences. Conversely, if the state lasts longer, the uncertainty in energy is smaller, so we can detect smaller differences.

Wait, the question says "we want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

So for each state, I need to compute the uncertainty in energy based on their lifetimes. The energy difference between the two levels (E2 - E1) should be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Or wait, maybe each has its own uncertainty, but the overall uncertainty would depend on some combination. Hmm, maybe I should compute the uncertainty for each state and take the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE should be such that it's larger than the uncertainty from each state, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Each energy level has its own lifetime, so each has its own ΔE. To resolve two levels, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from both? Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty between them?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's approach this step
