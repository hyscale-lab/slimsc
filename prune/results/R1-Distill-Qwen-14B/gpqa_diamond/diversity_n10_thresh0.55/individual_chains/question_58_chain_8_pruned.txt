Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the results non-physical. So regularization is a way to handle these infinities, maybe by introducing a cutoff or something.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. I think QED is renormalizable, which means you can absorb the infinities by redefining the parameters. But does it require regularization? I think regularization is a step in the process, but maybe it's not always necessary if the theory is renormalizable. Or wait, maybe not. Because even if a theory is renormalizable, you might still use regularization techniques as part of the calculation process before renormalization. So QED probably does require regularization, but since it's renormalizable, you don't need as much or it's manageable.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory and non-abelian, so it's more complicated. QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative methods work. But wait, do you need regularization in QCD? I think yes, because it's a non-abelian gauge theory with more complex divergences. Also, things like confinement might require different treatments, but I'm not sure if that relates to regularization.

Superstring Theory is a theory of everything, combining general relativity and quantum mechanics. It's a type of string theory that includes supersymmetry. String theories in general don't have the same kinds of divergences as point particle theories because strings are extended objects. I think that string theories don't require the same regularization because they have better high-energy behavior, maybe even being finite. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they ever have divergences? I remember that in the early days of string theory, there were issues with divergences, but with the introduction of conformal field theories and the right formulations like in the AdS/C
