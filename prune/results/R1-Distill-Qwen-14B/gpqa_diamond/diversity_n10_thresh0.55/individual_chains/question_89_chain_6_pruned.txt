Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think about each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Because the molecule is 1,3-dibromo, wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So it's a four-carbon structure in a diamond-like framework. The 1 and 3 positions have bromine atoms. So if we eliminate two Br atoms, probably from adjacent carbons? Wait, no. Wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent. So perhaps it's a di-elimination? Or maybe it's a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, 1 and 3 are across from each other. Hmm. Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has four carbons in a chair-like structure. Positions 1 and 3 are on opposite ends, perhaps. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two opposite carbons of the adamantane structure.

Wait, but elimination reactions usually happen
