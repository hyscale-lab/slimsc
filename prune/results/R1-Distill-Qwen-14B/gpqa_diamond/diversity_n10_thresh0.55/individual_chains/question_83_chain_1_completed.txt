Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then, when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, the pH changes depending on how much of the base has been added.

First, let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the equivalence point volume for the titration.
3. Find out the pH at 25% titration (which is a quarter of the equivalence point volume added).
4. Find the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me start with step 1. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). 

The moles of acetic acid before dilution are volume (L) multiplied by molarity. So, 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by total volume: 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol. 

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The reaction consumes acetic acid and produces acetate ions. For every mole of NaOH added, a mole of acetic acid is converted to acetate.

So, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol
Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 mol
Moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol

The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, but wait, the pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) which is about 4.736 (since log(1.85e-5)= -4.736, so pKa is 4.736).

So, plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = 4.736 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)
Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333. Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.736 - 0.477 ≈ 4.259. Rounding to two decimal places gives about 4.26.

Wait, but the options have 4.26 as an option (option A). But wait, I have to check the other part as well.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of acetate ion at equivalence point are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:
CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is small, so the hydrolysis is not extensive. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be the [OH^-] produced. Then,

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11
x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485, so pH is 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515, approximately 8.52.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that would match.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Another approach for the equivalence point is to calculate it considering the hydrolysis of acetate.

Wait, another thought: I might have miscalculated the Kb. Let me double-check Ka and Kb.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10. That part was correct.

So the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M acetate. The Kb expression is correct, and the calculation seems right. So pH would be around 8.51, which is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but let me check another approach for the equivalence point. The solution is 0.02 M in acetate. The pH can be calculated using the formula for weak bases.

The formula is pH = pKa + pKw/2, but wait, that's when the solution is a 1:1 salt, but no, that's for when the solution is a strong acid and strong base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the solution is a salt of a weak acid, the pH is determined by the Kb as I did.

Wait, let me re-calculate the Kb and x.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

pOH = log(3.288e-6) = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. pH = 14 -5.485 = 8.515. So 8.51, which rounds to 8.52.

So option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which matches.

Wait, but another possibility: when we reach the equivalence point, sometimes the solution's pH can be found using the formula for the hydrolysis of acetate. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation instead of the approximation.

Let me try that. So the equation is:

x^2/(0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10

Assume x is small compared to 0.02, so it's negligible. So the approximation holds, as 5e-10 * 0.02 is 1e-11, whose square root is 1e-5.5, which is 3e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the assumption is valid.

So equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

Now, for 25% titration, I got pH 4.26. Let's see the options. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches.

Wait, but let me check another option. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me re-express the 25% titration.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. Moles of NaOH: 0.0025 L * 0.1 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

After reaction, moles of acetic acid: 0.00075, moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is about 4.736.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) = -0.477.

So pH = 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259, which is 4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 and at equivalence is 8.52. So option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches. So the answer would be A.

Wait another thought: sometimes in dilution, are there any other factors? Let me check the initial dilution again.

Yes, initial volume 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles: 0.02 L * 0.05 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ water, total volume 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

So I think I did everything right. So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by calculating the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.02 \, \text{L} \times 0.05 \, \text{M} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 1: pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

Initially, there are 0.001 mol of acetic acid. After the reaction, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid remains, and 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) is formed. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.736\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.736 - 0.477 = 4.259 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Step 2: pH at the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \(x\) be the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - [OH^-]}.
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M, we approximate \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x \approx 0.02\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \(K_b = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}\):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. These values match option **A**.

**Answer: A**
