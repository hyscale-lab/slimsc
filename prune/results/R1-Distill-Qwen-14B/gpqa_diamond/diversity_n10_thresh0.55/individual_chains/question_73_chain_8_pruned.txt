Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So, both are moving in the same direction. But wait, the question is about their relative speed. Oh right, relative speed is the speed of one object as seen from the other's frame of reference. So I can't just subtract the speeds directly because we're dealing with velocities close to the speed of light—relativity effects come into play.

I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. The relative velocity formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the second object and v is the velocity of the first as observed from the stationary frame. Wait, no, actually, I should get this right. Let me think: if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B is moving at v in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. If I'm in the frame of astronaut A, which is moving at u (say, 0.6c), and I want to find B's velocity, which is moving at v (0.5c) in the same direction as A's frame. So from A's perspective, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (
