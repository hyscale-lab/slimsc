Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, and HIRES can go up to 16. So wait, brighter stars have lower magnitudes, right? Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Magnitudes are a bit tricky. The lower the apparent magnitude, the brighter the star. So if a star has an apparent V magnitude of, say, 16, it's dimmer than a star with 15. 

The question is about which stars are detectable by both spectrographs. So any star that is bright enough (apparent magnitude ≤ 17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES) would be detected by both. Wait, but wait, no: because each spectrograph has its own limit. So the star must be within both limits. So the apparent magnitude must be ≤16 because HIRES can't see beyond 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So any star that's ≤16 mag in V would be detected by both.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, that wording is a bit tricky. Brighter than 17 mag would mean the star's V mag is less than 17. Because higher magnitude means dimmer. So if a
