Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me start by going through the given information step by step.

The question says the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Hmm, I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or something more acidic like a carboxylic acid. But then, the problem says several peaks in the NMR including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl would be like CH₂=CH groups, so that's sp² hybridized. So maybe the compound has a double bond, perhaps part of a ring or an alkene.

The FTIR also has strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, or maybe it's an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. Another thought: maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. For example, in a ring like benzene, the C=C stretch is around 1
