Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution or elimination reaction, maybe a Hofmann elimination or something else... Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, another thought: maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an ester or something else. Alternatively, I think that when a compound with a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo some kind of addition or substitution.

Let me start by analyzing the spectral data for compound X.

First, the IR data: peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1. That broad region suggests O-H stretching, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of a peak around 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Also, the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbony
