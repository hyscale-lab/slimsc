Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is given as c multiplied by a matrix S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are used for spin-1/2 particles, which a muon is, since it's a lepton like an electron but heavier. So the intrinsic angular momentum operator components are typically represented using these matrices multiplied by some constants.

Let me think about the structure. The matrix S given looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y. But wait, the operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, so A_y = c * S.

Wait, what's the expression for the angular momentum operator? Oh right, the spin angular momentum S for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But wait, in this case, the constant c is h/(4π). Hmm, let me make sure I get the constants right.

Wait, Planck's constant h is related to ħ (h-bar) by ħ = h/(2π). So let's compute c: c = h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) * (1/2) = ħ*(1/2). So c is ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Because c is h/(4π) which is ħ/2 since ħ= h/(2π). Oh wait, wait, let me compute that again. Let's see: h/(4π) is equal to (1/(2π)) * h/2. But ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4pi) = ħ/2. Yes.

So A_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. Now, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices. Their eigenvalues are known to be ±1. Because, when you solve for the eigenvalues of σ_y, for example, you'll get eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Wait, but the operator A_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σ_y. Since σ_y's eigenvalues are ±1, A_y's eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvalue equation is A_y |φ> = a |φ>, so a would be ± (ħ/2). But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so (ħ/2) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait, that doesn't match any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +2πh or –2πh, and the real parts are +h/(4π) or –h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of A_y are real? Or wait, no—wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, the matrix A_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, and σ_y is a Hermitian matrix because it's a Pauli matrix. So A_y is Hermitian because it's a real scalar multiplied by a Hermitian matrix. So the eigenvalues of A_y must be real. So any option suggesting that the eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts is incorrect. So options A and B can be eliminated because they have imaginary parts in the eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So is S Hermitian? Let me check: the conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. Because S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, A_y is c times S, so c is a real constant, so A_y is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real. So any option that says the eigenvalues have an imaginary part is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect. So that leaves options C and D.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are ±ħ/2. Because A_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So a = ± ħ/2.

But ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), but the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are wrong, as I thought.

So now, looking at the options C and D. Let's read them again.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of the operator A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, A_z. Hmm. Let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator, A², for spin-1/2 particles is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * ( σ · σ ) I think. Wait, for spin-1/2 particles, the square of the spin operator S is S² = ( (ħ/2)^2 ) ( σ · σ ) * 3? No, wait, maybe I'm confusing with something else. Wait, the spin angular momentum operator is S = (ħ/2) σ, so S² would be (ħ/2)^2 (σ · σ) I. But σ · σ for each component is σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z². Oh, but wait, for Pauli matrices, each σ_i squared is identity matrix. So σ_x² = I, σ_y² = I, σ_z² = I. So σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² = 3I. So S² = (ħ²/4) * 3 I. So S² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any state that is an eigenstate of S_y would be an eigenstate of S², because S² is the same for all states. So A^2 is (ħ²/4) * 3 I. So when you apply A^2 to any eigenvector of A_y, it would just multiply by a scalar. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A². Therefore, option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But it also says that they are not eigenfunctions of A_z, the Z-component. Hmm.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S_x are not eigenstates of S_z, and vice versa. Because S_x and S_z don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of S_y, it can't be an eigenstate of S_z. So in our case, the eigenfunctions of A_y (which is proportional to S_y) are eigenfunctions of A^2 (because A^2 is a scalar multiple of identity) but not of A_z. So option C's statement is correct.

So option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are the standard basis vectors, like |0> and |1>, but the eigenfunctions of Ay would be the eigenvectors of Ay. So if the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form a basis for the vector space, but the statement is a bit ambiguous. I'm not sure what it's exactly saying. But whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the space, but that's always the case for any Hermitian operator. So the eigenfunctions φ are a basis for the space, but the option says "the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Maybe it's not correct because the basis functions are usually the standard basis, not the eigenvectors unless the operator is diagonal in that basis.

Alternatively, the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis vectors of the operator. The operator is 2x2, so its basis is the standard basis. But if the operator is diagonal, then the basis vectors are eigenvectors. But in this case, Ay is not diagonal. So the standard basis is not the same as the eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenfunctions φ are not the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So option D is incorrect.

So combining all this, the correct statement is option C.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The Pauli Y matrix \( S \) is Hermitian, with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot S \) (where \( \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, so any statement suggesting nonzero imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

2. **Eliminating Options A and B:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \), which is also incorrect for the same reason.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix (since \( A^2 = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 (\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + \sigma_z^2) = \frac{3\hbar^2}{4} I \)), making it the same for all states.
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes Option C correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the eigenvectors of \( A_y \), which are not the same as the standard basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). Thus, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
