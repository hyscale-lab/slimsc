Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The form is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So I should write that out properly.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators are related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh right, S here looks a lot like σy. Let me check: the standard σy is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Yes, that's exactly S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±ℏ/2, but wait, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by factors. Because the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are (ℏ/2) σ matrices. Oh right, because spin operators are (ℏ/2) * Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is c·S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute what that is in terms of ℏ. Since h is Planck's constant h = 2πℏ, so h/(4π) is (2πℏ)/(4π) )= ℏ/(2). So c is ℏ/2.

So Ay = (ℏ/2) * σy. Wait, but the spin matrices are (ℏ/2)σ, so Ay is essentially the Y component of the spin operator. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be ±ℏ/2.

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so when multiplied by ℏ/2, the eigenvalues become ±ℏ/2.

So the possible eigenvalues a are ±ℏ/2.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±h/4π? No
