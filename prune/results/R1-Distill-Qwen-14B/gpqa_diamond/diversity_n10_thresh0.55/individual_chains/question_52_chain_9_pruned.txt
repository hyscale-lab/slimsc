Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots on its surface affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but wait. The spots are dark, so they're cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the spots cover part of the surface, the star's overall Teff is lower. But how does that affect the photospheric conditions where the Ti lines form?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star isn't spotted, the ratio is higher, and when it is, it's lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. I remember that Ti lines are often used as temperature indicators in stellar atmospheres. 

The photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Saha equation and Boltzmann equation apply. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The ratio we're looking at is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Let's think: if the temperature decreases, how does the ratio change?

Wait, the ratio is n_level1 / n_level2, so when the temperature drops, how does that affect each term? Let's compute the ratio.

The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because (n2/n1) is (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), so (n1/n2) is the inverse.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

So when temperature T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller (since T is in the denominator, and it's negative). So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease when T decreases. Wait, no, because as T goes down, the exponent (-ΔE/(k T)) becomes a larger negative number. Wait, ΔE is positive since E2 > E1. So for higher E2 than E1, the exponent is negative.

Wait, let me clarify. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. So the exponential term becomes smaller. So n2/n1 is (g2/g1) multiplied by a smaller number. So if T decreases, the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. 

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels decreases. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. So when T is lower (with spots), the ratio (n2/n1) is lower. Which makes sense, because the exponential term is smaller. 

But wait, the ratio in the problem is the ratio of the number of Ti in two levels. So if the ratio of n1 to n2 is higher when the star has spots (because the ratio n2/n1 is lower), that would mean that the number of atoms in the lower level (n1) is higher relative to the higher level (n2) when the temperature is lower. This is because lower temperatures make the thermal excitation to the higher level less likely.

So now, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio (n1/n2 or n2/n1) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me rephrase: when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So the ratio (say, n2/n1) is lower in spots. So the ratio without spots is higher.

So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

But to compute this, we need to relate the two temperatures. The effective temperature changes from 6000 K to 5500 K. So T1
