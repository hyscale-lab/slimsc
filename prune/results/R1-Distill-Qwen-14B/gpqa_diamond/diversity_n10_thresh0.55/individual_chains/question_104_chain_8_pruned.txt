Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method looks at the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's existence and some of its properties.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, each having a planet similar to Neptune. So both stars are like our Sun, and the planets have about the same mass. They found the planets using the RV method, and each shows a periodic shift in their spectral lines.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. They’re asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The velocity semi-amplitude is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. I remember the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π * (P * (1 day in seconds)) )) )

But wait, since the planets are much less massive than the stars, M_p is negligible compared to M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, actually, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (2π) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ] * ( (1) / ( (P * (1 day in seconds) ) ) ) )

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P. Since both planets have the same mass and same star mass, the relationship between K and P might come into play.

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) / sqrt(1 - e²) )

But because the planets have circular orbits (e=0), that term goes away. Also, since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars. So M_p is the same for both planets (Neptune mass) and M_* is same as Sun.

So if I can express K in terms of P, then K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let me think. Let me rearrange the formula. Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ), but wait that might not be exactly right.

Wait, no. Let's write the formula correctly. The semi-amplitude K for the radial velocity is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (2π) * (1 - e²
