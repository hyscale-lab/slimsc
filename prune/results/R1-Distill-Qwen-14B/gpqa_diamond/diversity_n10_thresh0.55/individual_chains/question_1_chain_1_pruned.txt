Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, okay, let's try to break it down. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The question is asking which energy difference would let us clearly distinguish between these two energy levels.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a system are related to their lifetimes through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, maybe it's just Planck's constant? I think it's ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, maybe the approximate formula is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. No, wait, the exact form is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But sometimes people use it as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ for order of magnitude estimates.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (time uncertainty). So, if the lifetime is longer, the energy uncertainty is smaller, and vice versa.

The energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the uncertainty for them to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart—they sort of blur together.

Wait, so for each state, we can calculate the energy uncertainty based on their lifetimes. The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater
