Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So the structure is kind of like a cube that's been deformed a bit.

The given data: the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter, so that's the 'a' in a cubic system. Oh wait, but rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait no, I think it's part of the cubic system as a special case. Because in the cubic system, if all angles are 90 degrees, it's cubic. If all angles are equal but not 90, like 60, then it's rhombohedral.

So the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstrom here? Or is it the interatomic distance? Because sometimes people use 'a' as the lattice parameter, which is the edge length of the unit cell. So yeah, I think a is 10 here.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Wait, that's interesting because in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are usually 60 or 90, but I guess 30 is possible too. But the formula for interplanar distance might be the same regardless.

The interplanar distance d(hkl) is calculated using the formula: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a
