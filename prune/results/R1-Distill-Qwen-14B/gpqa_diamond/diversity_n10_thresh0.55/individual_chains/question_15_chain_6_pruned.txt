Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, given the information provided. Let me start by recalling what factors influence the transit probability of a planet. 

From what I remember, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in the star's brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. But I think there are other factors too.

Wait, the transit probability formula I think is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a^2 (1 - e^2)) )^(1/2), but wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability for a planet to transit is approximately (R / a), where R is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But that's a simplified version, right?

Wait, more accurately, the probability P that a planet transits its star is given by P =
