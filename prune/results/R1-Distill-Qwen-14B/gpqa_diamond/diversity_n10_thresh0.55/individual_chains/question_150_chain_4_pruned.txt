Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's all about. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I have to figure out the final product from the options given.

First, I'll need to figure out the structure of the starting compound using the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So that's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's calculate: 18-9=9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond (1), and maybe another ring or double bondâ€”wait, 3 (benzene) + 1 (double bond) = 4, so one more, which is another ring or double bond. Hmm, or maybe more rings. Alternatively, other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data: The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Starting with the 9.72 ppm triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. But wait, the triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and show up as singlets, but maybe in some cases they can show coupling. Alternatively, another possibility: maybe an acidic proton, like from a phenol or something else.

Wait, but let's think about the other peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each integrating to 2H. They could be from para-substituted benzene rings, maybe with substituents. For example,
