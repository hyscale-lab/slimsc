Alright, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, the question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy. The options are A to D, so I have to calculate and choose the correct one.

Wait, first, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus usually has 3 protons. Wait, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Li-6 is a common isotope, yeah.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the energy is relativistic, so I think I need to use the relativistic energy formulas. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes in particle physics, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, no, sometimes it refers to the total energy. I need to be careful here.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So I'm guessing this is the total energy per nucleus. Because when you talk about the energy of the collider, it's the total energy imparted to each ion. So each nucleus is accelerated to a certain speed, and we need to find the total energy.

So the formula for the total energy (E) of a relativistic particle is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me calculate gamma first. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0c²) for Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is needed. Wait, the mass is approximately that of a nucleus with 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, wait, because the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less due to binding energy. Hmm, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can approximate using the sum of individual nucleon masses, or maybe just take the atomic mass.

Wait, but wait, the exact mass is probably needed for precision. So perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the proton mass as the nucleon mass, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, the problem says "nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons", which is Li-6. So its atomic mass is approximately 6.015 g/mol or something like that. Wait, but in terms of mass in GeV/c², each proton is about 938 MeV, each neutron is about 939.565 MeV, I think. Let me recall the exact numbers. Proton mass is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is approximately 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's calculate that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3 * 939.565 = let's see: 939.565 *3. 900*3=2700, 39.565 *3=118.695. So 2700 + 118.695 = 2818.695 MeV.

Add both together: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So 5633.511 MeV is the rest mass energy. That's 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's just the sum of the individual nucleons. The actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less because of the binding energy. But in the absence of exact values, perhaps the problem expects me to use this approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem just uses the proton mass as the mucleon mass, but that might not be accurate. Wait, let me think. Since the question is about the energy of the nucleus, which is roughly the sum of the masses of the nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mucleon mass as approximately 938 MeV/c².

Wait, another approach: the mass of Li-6 is about 6 nucleons. So 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. But the actual mass is a bit less because the binding energy. But perhaps the problem expects me to use 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, but if I use the exact mass, it's better. Let me check some known values. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ ?

Calculating 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.015 *931.5 = 13.9725 MeV, so total is 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is about 5.603 GeV.

So using the exact atomic mass, the rest energy is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but note that the actual mass is 6.015 u, so 6.015 *931.5 ≈ 5602.97 MeV, which is 5.603 GeV.

So the rest mass energy m0c² is 5.603 GeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m0c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.603.

First, 3 *5.603 =16.809.

0.5714 *5.603.

0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.0714 *5.603≈0.402.

So 0.5714 *5.603≈2.8015 +0.402=3.2035.

Total E≈16.809 +3.2035≈20.0125 GeV.

Hmm, so around 20 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419 GeV, option B is 23.069, and A is 18.475.

Wait, but my approximation might be a bit rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Gamma is exactly 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, as before. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603:

First, 5.603 *3 = 16.809.

5.603 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

5.603 * (4/7) = ?

5.603 /7 = approximately 0.8004, multiplied by 4 is 3.2016.

So 16.809 +3.2016≈20.0106 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation with more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, 0.96c, let's compute gamma precisely.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 exactly, as before. So 3.57142857...

So 3.57142857 *5.603.

Wait, 5.603 *3.57142857.

Let me compute:

3.57142857 ≈ 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, 25/7 = 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.603. Let me compute 25 *5.603 =140.075, then divide by 7.

140.075 /7 =20.0107 GeV.

So approximately 20.0107 GeV.

So the total energy is about 20.01 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher, and option D is 21.4, which is way higher.

Wait, but wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the rest mass is incorrect. Because if the actual rest mass is higher, the energy would be higher.

Wait, I used the atomic mass of Li-6 as 6.015 u, but perhaps the problem uses the mucleon mass as 938 MeV. So let me recalculate with m0c² as 6 *938 MeV.

6 *938 MeV = 5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Hmm, let's compute:

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628 =2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628 ≈ 0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404 =3.218.

So total E is 16.884 +3.218 ≈20.102 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.102 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is close.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation for the rest mass is causing the discrepancy. Let me think again.

The exact rest mass of Li-6 is 6.015116 u. Then, using 1 u =931.494 MeV/c².

So 6.015116 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.015116 *931.494 ≈ 0.015116 *930 = approx 14.03 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.964 +14.03 ≈5603 MeV =5.603 GeV.

Wait, but then the calculation with 5.603 GeV gives E=20.01 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132) but perhaps not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes using the proton mass for calculating the rest energy of the nucleus, which would be 3*(proton mass) +3*(neutron mass), which is more precise.

Wait, let's get more precise with the masses. The proton mass is 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is 939.5654 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3 *938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 *939.5654 = 2818.6962 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.6962 =5633.5122 MeV =5.6335122 GeV.

So using this exact value, m0c² =5.6335122 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m0c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6335122 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 3 *5.6335122 =16.9005366.

0.57142857 *5.6335122 = ?

Let me compute 5.6335122 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7. So 5.6335122 *4/7.

Multiply 5.6335122 by 4: 22.5340488.

Divide by 7: 3.2191498.

So 3.2191498.

Adding to 16.9005366 gives 16.9005366 +3.2191498 =20.1196864 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, but let me compute 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.6335122 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact value.

3.5714285714... is 25/7.

So 25/7 *5.6335122 = (25 *5.6335122 ) /7.

25 *5.6335122 =140.837805.

Divide by 7: 140.837805 /7 ≈20.119686 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.119686 GeV. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.012 GeV higher. Perhaps I made a calculation error or the problem is using a different mucleon mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy in terms of the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, wait, that's a crucial point. Because the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is the collider's energy. Does that refer to the kinetic energy or the total energy (rest + kinetic)?

In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or wait, sometimes the total energy. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, I think in colliders, the energy is the kinetic energy. Because the rest mass is small compared to the kinetic energy, but wait, in this case, for heavy ions, the rest mass isn't negligible.

Wait, let's think again. The question asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c.

So, the speed is v =0.96c.

In relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m0 c².

So, if the energy is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m0 c².

But if the energy is the total energy, then E_total = gamma * m0 c².

So which one does the question refer to?

The question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

Usually, collider experiments specify the kinetic energy or the beam energy, which is the total energy minus the rest mass. Or wait, no, wait, for high-energy particles, the beam energy is often given as the kinetic energy.

Wait, for example, the LHC typically reports its energy as the proton's kinetic energy, but I'm not sure about RHIC. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy is given. Hmm.

But in this case, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy because when you have a speed given, you can compute the gamma and thus the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rest frame.

But given that the problem uses the speed to find the energy, I think the energy refers to the total energy, not the kinetic. Because the speed is given, so the gamma is based on the speed, and the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass.

So, the calculation I did earlier, which resulted in approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Wait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 25/7 *5.6335122.

Compute 5.6335122 *25 =140.837805.

Divide by 7: 140.837805 /7 =20.119686 GeV.

So approximately 20.119686 GeV, which is about 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy between my calculation and the option? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, let's compute the exact rest mass using precise values.

Each proton: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron: m_n = 939.5654 MeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3*(938.272) =2814.816 MeV.

3*(939.5654)=2818.6962 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.6962 =5633.5122 MeV =5.6335122 GeV.

Gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6335122 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335122.

Let me compute this as:

5.6335122 *3 =16.9005366.

5.6335122 *0.57142857.

Wait, 0.57142857 is 4/7. So 5.6335122 *4 =22.5340488.

22.5340488 /7 ≈3.2191498.

Adding to 16.9005366: 16.9005366 +3.2191498 =20.1196864 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.0123 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check the exact atomic mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015116 u.

So 6.015116 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964 MeV.

0.015116 u *931.494 MeV/u =0.015116 *931.494 ≈14.047 MeV.

Total =5588.964 +14.047 =5603.011 MeV =5.603011 GeV.

So using this, the m0c² is 5.603011 GeV.

Then E =3.57142857 *5.603011.

Compute:

3 *5.603011 =16.809033.

0.57142857 *5.603011 ≈3.2015.

Total E≈16.809033 +3.2015 ≈20.0105 GeV.

Which is about 20.0105 GeV, but that's not matching option C either.

Wait, but earlier when I used 5.6335 GeV, the result was ~20.1197 GeV, which is closer to option C. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, not their actual atomic mass.

Thus, perhaps the correct calculation is 20.1197 GeV, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let's recalculate the rest mass precisely.

Wait, another approach: the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015116 u. So 6.015116 u *931.494 MeV/u = ?

So 6.015116 *931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.015116 *931.494 = let's compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005116 *931.494.

Compute 0.005 *931.494=4.65747.

0.000116 *931.494 ≈0.10805.

So 4.65747 +0.10805 =4.76552.

So 0.005116 *931.494 ≈4.76552.

Now, 9.31494 (from 0.01) +4.76552 (from 0.005116) =14.08046 MeV.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.964 +14.08046 =5603.04446 MeV =5.6030446 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6030446 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6030446.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

First, compute 3 *5.6030446 =16.8091338.

Then compute 0.57142857 *5.6030446.

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7.

4/7 *5.6030446 = (5.6030446 *4) /7 =22.4121784 /7 ≈3.20174.

So adding 16.8091338 +3.20174 =20.0108738 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV, which is ~20.01 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, given v=0.96c, beta = v/c =0.96.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96²) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let's see. Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m0c².

So with gamma =3.57142857.

Kinetic energy E_kinetic = (3.57142857 -1)*5.6030446 GeV.

= 2.57142857 *5.6030446.

Compute that.

2 *5.6030446 =11.20609.

0.57142857 *5.6030446 ≈3.20174.

So total E_kinetic ≈11.20609 +3.20174 =14.40783 GeV.

But that's only about 14.4 GeV, which is not matching any option. So the energy given in the problem must be the total energy.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass as 6 *938.272 MeV, as that's a standard approximation.

So 6 *938.272 =5629.632 MeV =5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E =3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632.

Again, 5.629632 *4 =22.518528.

Divide by7:22.518528 /7≈3.2169326.

So total E≈16.888896 +3.2169326 =20.1058286 GeV.

So about 20.1058 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But why is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise values would give a more accurate result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of beta as 0.96, so gamma is calculated as follows:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.57142857.

But perhaps the exact calculation should not approximate and carry more decimal places.

Wait, let's recalculate gamma with more precision. Let's compute the exact value.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly, as 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 =3.5714285714...

So no error there.

But perhaps the rest mass is taken as 5.6335 GeV, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which is closer to option C (20.132 GeV).

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of a more precise value of the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has an error in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy using the exact expression without approximations.

Let me compute gamma as 3.5714285714285714.

Now, E =gamma * m0c².

Given m0c² =5.6335122 GeV.

E =3.5714285714285714 *5.6335122.

Let me compute this using the exact multiplication.

3.5714285714285714 *5.6335122.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.6335122 =16.9005366.

0.5714285714285714 *5.6335122.

Compute 5.6335122 *0.5 =2.8167561.

5.6335122 *0.07142857142857142.

Wait, 0.07142857142857142 is 1/14.

So 5.6335122 /14 =0.40239372857 GeV.

So 2.8167561 +0.40239372857 =3.2191498286 GeV.

Adding to 16.9005366:

16.9005366 +3.2191498286 =20.1196864286 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.119686 GeV.

Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.0123 GeV higher. Hmm, but why?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3 * (938.272 MeV) = 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 * (939.5654 MeV) =3 *939.5654 =2818.6962 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 +2818.6962 =5633.5122 MeV =5.6335122 GeV. That's correct.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6335122 =20.119686 GeV.

So, the energy is approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

But my calculation gives 20.1197 GeV, which is 20.12 GeV when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to four decimal places, and the option is 20.1320 GeV, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps during calculation, I should carry more decimal places.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6335122 with more precision.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6335122.

Let me compute 3 *5.6335122 =16.9005366.

0.57142857 *5.6335122.

Compute 0.57142857 *5.6335122:

Let me compute this as:

5.6335122 * (0.5 + 0.07142857)

=5.6335122 *0.5 =2.8167561

5.6335122 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is approximately 1/14.

5.6335122 /14 = 0.40239372857.

So 2.8167561 +0.40239372857 =3.21914982857.

Adding to 16.9005366 gives:

16.9005366 +3.21914982857 =20.11968642857 GeV.

So 20.1196864 GeV.

Hmm, the option is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.0123 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 6.015116 u. So 6.015116 *931.494 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute this precisely.

6.015116 *931.494 = ?

Compute 6 *931.494 =5588.964.

0.015116 *931.494 = ?

Compute 0.01 *931.494 =9.31494.

0.005116 *931.494.

Compute 0.005 *931.494 =4.65747.

0.000116 *931.494 ≈0.10805.

So 4.65747 +0.10805 =4.76552.

So 0.005116 *931.494 =4.76552.

Adding to 9.31494 gives 9.31494 +4.76552 =14.08046.

So total rest mass energy is 5588.964 +14.08046 =5603.04446 MeV =5.6030446 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6030446.

Compute:

3 *5.6030446 =16.8091338.

0.57142857 *5.6030446 = ?

5.6030446 *0.57142857.

Again, 5.6030446 *4 =22.4121784.

Divide by7: 22.4121784 /7 =3.20174 GeV.

So 16.8091338 +3.20174 =20.0108738 GeV.

So about 20.01 GeV.

Hmm, now I'm getting confused. Earlier, using the sum of individual nucleon masses, I got ~20.12 GeV, but using the exact atomic mass, I get ~20.01 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.01; option C is 20.132, which is close to the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus as 6 times the mass of a proton, which is 938 MeV.

So 6 *938 =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV.

E =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

5.628 *0.5=2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857 ≈0.402.

Total: 2.814 +0.402 =3.216.

So E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV) when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, but 20.1 is 20.1000 GeV, but the option is 20.132, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is taken as 5.633 GeV, leading to E=20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is about 20.13 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6335122 exactly.

Let me compute:

3.57142857 *5.6335122.

Compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6335122.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0335122.

0.03 *3.57142857 =0.107142857.

0.0035122 *3.57142857 ≈0.01253.

So 0.107142857 +0.01253 =0.11967.

So 3.57142857 *0.0335122 ≈0.11967.

Adding to the 2.142857142 gives 2.142857142 +0.11967 =2.262527142.

So 3.57142857 *0.6335122 ≈2.262527142.

Adding to the initial 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.262527142 =20.11966999 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV.

Rounding to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.0123 GeV higher.

Ah, perhaps the problem expects us to account for the binding energy. Wait, but that's what I did when using the exact atomic mass, but that led to a lower energy.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the rest mass as 6 * (938 MeV) =5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 =20.1 GeV.

Which is 20.1000 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is 0.032 GeV higher.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to select the closest option, which is option C (20.132 GeV), as it's the closest to my calculation when using the sum of individual nucleon masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic kinetic energy, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the energy in terms of the rest mass of the nucleus.

Wait, another approach: compute the total energy as E=gamma * m0 c², where m0 is the rest mass of Li-6.

But perhaps I should use the exact values provided by the problem, which says that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6.

Assuming that the problem expects me to use the mass of a lithium nucleus as approximately 6 times the mass of a proton (since 3 protons and 3 neutrons), perhaps I should proceed with that.

But without exact data, it's hard to say. Given the options, the closest calculation to my detailed steps is option C, 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information and Formulas
1. **Nucleus Identification**: The nucleus \( X \) is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass number \( A = 6 \).
2. **Relativistic Energy Formula**: The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:
   \[
   E = \gamma m_0 c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Lorentz Factor**: For a particle moving at speed \( v = 0.96c \), the Lorentz factor is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
   \]
4. **Rest Mass Energy**: The rest mass of Li-6 can be approximated using the sum of the masses of its nucleons:
   - Proton mass: \( m_p \approx 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
   - Neutron mass: \( m_n \approx 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
   - Total rest mass energy:
     \[
     m_0 c^2 = 3m_p + 3m_n = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 5633.512 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633512 \, \text{GeV}
     \]

### Calculation of Total Energy
Using the relativistic energy formula:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]
Substitute \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.633512 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633512 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into components:
\[
E = (3 \times 5.633512) + (0.5714 \times 5.633512)
\]
1. \( 3 \times 5.633512 = 16.900536 \, \text{GeV} \)
2. \( 0.5714 \times 5.633512 \approx 3.21915 \, \text{GeV} \)

Adding these:
\[
E \approx 16.900536 + 3.21915 = 20.119686 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.1197 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A)** \( 18.475 \, \text{GeV} \): Too low.
- **B)** \( 23.069 \, \text{GeV} \): Too high.
- **C)** \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \): Closest to the calculated value.
- **D)** \( 21.419 \, \text{GeV} \): Too high.

Thus, the closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, given the speed \( v = 0.96c \) for the Li-6 nucleus, is approximately \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \).
