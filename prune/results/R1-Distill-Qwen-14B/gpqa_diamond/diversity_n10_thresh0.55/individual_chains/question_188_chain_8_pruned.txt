Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance—oh right, that's the d-spacing. The formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), or something like that. Or wait, maybe it's a more general formula that applies to any crystal system. Let me think. Oh yeah, for a general crystal, the formula is d_hkl = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl)cosα )) ), but wait, that's specific to cubic systems. No, wait, maybe I'm mixing up formulas.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all the angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are all the same, 30 degrees here. So the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosγ ) — since all angles are equal, γ is 30 degrees.

So the given problem is for the (111) plane, meaning h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging these into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1 + 1 + 1) - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) cos(30°) )

Wait, let me compute that step by step. The numerator is a, which is the interatomic distance, given as 10 Angstroms.

The denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*cos30°). Because h, k, l are all 1, so h squared is 1, same for k and l. So 1+1+1 is 3. Then the second part is 2*(hk +
