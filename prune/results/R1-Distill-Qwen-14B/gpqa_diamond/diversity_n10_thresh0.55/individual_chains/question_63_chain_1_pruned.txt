Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule composed of atoms X and Y. It's in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, the model here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Right, I remember that in such a model, the molecule's energy comes from both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

So, when a photon is absorbed, it causes a transition to the next state. But what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? I think that in rotational-vibrational spectra, the transitions can involve changes in both rotational and vibrational levels. But the next state with the lowest energy is probably the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational excitation.

Wait, no. The fundamental vibrational state is the ground state (n=0), and the first excited vibrational state is n=1. But in terms of energy, the vibrational levels are quantized with spacing that's higher than the rotational levels because vibrational energy spacing is larger. So the transition from the ground state (both vibration and rotation) to the first excited state would likely be a vibrational transition, because that's a higher energy jump, but wait, the question says the next state with the lowest
