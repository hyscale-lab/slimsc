Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's see what I can do.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through three reagents: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should try to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but wait, aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and split into a singlet if there are no adjacent protons. Oh wait, unless it's adjacent to another group. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a formyl group attached to a double bond next to another CH2 group.

Wait, looking at the options, they all have some aldehyde or aldehyde-like structures. Options A, B, C, D all have 'enals' or 'al' at the end, indicating an aldehyde group.

Next, the 6.98 ppm doublet (2H), 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). These look like aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted phenyl groups. The coupling pattern is a doublet for each, which is typical for para-substituted aromatic rings. So perhaps we have two phenyl groups attached to the molecule.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet suggests exchange or possibly hydroxyl protons. But wait, 2H? That's unusual for a hydroxyl group because hydroxyls are typically single, but maybe it's adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons on a double bond, or maybe part of an enol structure.

The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. Like an OCH2 group. So perhaps a methylene next to an oxygen, like an ether
