Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and major products for each part A, B, and C. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question provides three separate reactions, and I need to determine the products for each. Each option (A, B, C, D) gives possible products for all three parts. I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Wait, so sodium ethoxide is a strong base, which probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile in some reactions, but here it's reacting in a Michael addition. The Michael donor is the species that forms the enolate, right? Oh wait, actually, in the Michael addition, the enolate acts as a nucleophile. So which is the donor and which is the acceptor?

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form a stable enolate. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's the Michael acceptor. Because in the Michael reaction, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acceptor.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Wait, but wait, dimethyl malonate is CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. If it loses a proton to form an enolate, the enolate would have a negative charge on the central carbon. Then, when it attacks the acrylate, which is in the form CH₂=CHCO₂Me (but with a p-tolyl group in the E position — so the structure is more like CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO₂Me? Wait, no, the structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOR. So methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p
