Okay, so I've got this question about a drug's effect on mitochondria in a cell line. Hmm, I need to figure out which experiment won't help determine the mitochondrial role. Let's break it down.

The question says the drug is being tested on HEK293 cells. The experiments listed are four different methods. I think each method targets something different about the mitochondria. The point is to find which one doesn't relate to the mitochondria function.

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria, then using a Glucose Uptake Assay. Wait, differential centrifugation isolates mitochondria. If they do that, then using a kit to measure glucose uptakeâ€”glucose is a substrate for cellular respiration. But wait, the mitochondria are involved in breaking down glucose's products. Or do they handle other fuels like fatty acids? Or maybe this assay measures how much glucose the cells take in. But if mitochondria are involved in energy production, perhaps the drug affects glucose uptake. So this might show if mitochondria are functioning because if they're compromised, maybe less ATP, which could affect glucose uptake. So this experiment could be relevant. So it's probably not the answer.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and luminometer after adding luciferin. Hmm, wait, luciferase is an enzyme that uses luciferin to produce light. If the cells are transformed with it, maybe they are using it as a reporter. But wait, mitochondria are involved in apoptosis as well, like with cytochrome c release. Oh wait, maybe this is about ATP levels. Because luciferase requires ATP to function. Or
