Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that relativistic speeds involve some special relativity concepts, so I'll have to think about how that works.

First, let's break down the problem. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, the first astronaut (let's call him A) has mass 2m and velocity 0.6c. The second astronaut (B) has mass 3m and velocity 0.5c.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed is the difference in their velocities. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally because of the speed limit c. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is: 

v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²))

Wait, wait, let me get that right. If object A is moving at u and object B at v (same direction), then the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Oh, no, wait, if B is moving at v and A at u, then from B's frame, A's velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, u is 0.6c (A's speed), and v is 0.5c (B's speed). Wait, but wait, actually, the relative speed should be the speed of A as seen from B's frame, right? So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c.

So substituting into the formula:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplify the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator: (0.3c²)/(c²) is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0
