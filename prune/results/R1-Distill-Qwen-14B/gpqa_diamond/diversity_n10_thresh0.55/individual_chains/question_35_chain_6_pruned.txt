Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about angular momentum operators. Hmm. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon. It says Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

0  -i
i   0

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options A to D, I have to pick the correct statement regarding this calculation.

Wait, so first I should compute the matrix Ay. Since c = h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let's write that out:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix elements are:

Top left: 0
Top right: -i * h/(4π)
Bottom left: i * h/(4π)
Bottom right: 0

So the matrix is:

[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , 0 ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0.

The matrix Ay - aI is:

[ -a , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-
