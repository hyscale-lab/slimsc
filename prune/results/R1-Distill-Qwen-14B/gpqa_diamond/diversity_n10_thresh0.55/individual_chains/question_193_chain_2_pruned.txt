Okay, I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, the question says that astronomers observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the power of 5, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and the distance.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh right, plx = 1/distance, where distance is usually in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds. So if plx increases, the distance decreases because they're inversely proportional.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/d, where d is distance. So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. Then 1/(plx)^5 would be (1/plx)^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, wait, no, let me double-check. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Oh, wait, that's N increasing as distance increases? That seems counterintuitive because usually, you'd expect fewer stars at greater distances because they're fainter or more spread out. But the
