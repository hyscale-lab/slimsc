Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm, what melts around there? Maybe something like ice, but that's way lower. Wait, 277 K is 4 degrees Celsius. Maybe something like a solid that melts at that temperature. Not sure yet.

When X reacts with a certain keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. Oh wait, that makes me think of something like NaOH or KOH, which are strong bases and are used in various reactions. But wait, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is something like sodium or potassium? But wait, I'm not sure yet.

Let's break down the problem. The reaction between X and Y produces gas W. W's molecule has same neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, what if W is H2O? Because H2O's molecule has 2 H and 1 O. But H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2*(1) and 8. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons (since O is usually 16, 8p, 8n). Each H has 0 neutrons. So total neutrons: 8. Protons: 2*(1) +8= 10. Wait, that doesn't match. So W isn't H2O.

What else? Maybe CO2? No, CO2 has C (6p, 6n?), O (8p, 8n). So CO2 molecule: C has 6p and 6n (if it's carbon-12), O has 8p, 8n each. So protons: 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 16 = 22. Oh wait! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule? No, wait, each CO2 molecule has one C and two O. So for each O, 8p and 8n. So for CO2, total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 (from C) + 2*(8) = 22. Oh, that fits. So W is CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. So gas W is CO2. Then, the reaction between X and Y produces CO2, a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

So what could Y be? Let me think. If X is a metal, maybe Y is an acid. Let's say X is a carbonate. Wait, if X reacts with an acid, Y could be an acid, producing CO2. Alternatively, X could be a metal carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with HCl gives CO2, NaCl, and H2O. But then a precipitate wouldn't form unless maybe Y is a different acid.

Wait, but in the question, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. So perhaps X is a metal hydroxide and Y is an acid. But if X is a hydroxide, reacting with an acid would produce a salt and water. But then CO2 is a gas, which suggests perhaps carbonate reacting with acid.

Wait, another approach. If X is a metal carbonate, reacting with an acid Y would produce CO2 gas, the acid's salt, and water. But then the precipitate G would be the salt. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to give CO2, CaCl2, and H2O. But CaCl2 is soluble, so maybe Y isn't a strong acid. Alternatively, if Y is a weak acid, maybe the salt isn't soluble. Hmm.

Wait, but if X is a metal, maybe X is sodium. Sodium reacting with water (Y) produces H2 gas, but that's not CO2. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, but the reaction is X with Y gives CO2. So perhaps X is a metal, Y is a carbonate, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice? But that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is approximately 4°C. Hmm. Maybe some other material. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate which, upon heating, decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. Wait, but heating a carbonate usually produces the metal oxide and CO2. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. The melting point of CaO is about 2880°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Maybe a metal oxide that's solid at room temperature but melts around 277 K. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal bicarbonate or something else.

Wait, let's think differently. What if the precipitate G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and leaves a metal oxide. But the melting point of the metal oxide is about 277 K. Hmm, that's a low melting point for a metal oxide. Most metal oxides have higher melting points. Maybe it's a different kind of oxide. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound.

Wait, maybe when G is heated, it releases B, which is a gas. Because if B's melting point is 277 K, perhaps it is a solid under normal conditions but melts at that temperature. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that becomes liquid near that temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the gas W being CO2. So in the reaction, X and Y produce CO2. Let's think about possible X being a carbonate. So if X is Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4, then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. The CO2 is released as gas. The precipitate would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm, but that wouldn't precipitate. So perhaps Y is a carbonate and X is a metal. Or maybe X is a metal hydroxide.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate reacting with an acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So when X reacts with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, which is a keto acid?), the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is something like a strong base, like NaOH. Because when you neutralize an acid with a base, you get a salt and water. For example, if you have a carboxylic acid reacting with NaOH, you get a sodium salt (like sodium acetate) and water. The product would have, in the salt, the acetate ion. Wait, but the product in this case would be the salt, which has the acid's oxygen.

Wait, but the product of X and the keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is a water molecule? No, because that's H2O, which has O and H. Alternatively, maybe the product is an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction where a keto acid (like a ketone with a COOH group) reacts with a strong base. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldol addition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester. No, that's usually from acid and alcohol.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction between X and the keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a dehydrating agent, causing the keto acid to lose water. For example, if X is something like PCl5 or H2SO4, which can act as dehydrating agents. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, if X is a metal, like sodium, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid. Then, sodium reacts with acetic acid to produce sodium acetate and hydrogen gas. But sodium acetate has more than two oxygen atoms. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out what Substance X is based on the other clues. The fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope suggests that maybe the element has multiple isotopes, like chlorine (Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl) or something else.

Wait, the problem says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X need to be calculated. So X contains multiple elements. For example, sodium has a single common isotope (23Na), but maybe in X, one of the elements has multiple isotopes. But wait, the problem says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." So X could be a compound with two elements. For example, NaCl. Then the lightest element is Na, the heaviest is Cl. Their atomic masses would be added.

So what's the atomic mass of Na and Cl? Na is about 23, Cl is about 35.5. So 23 + 35.5 = 58.5. But looking at the options, the choices are 25, 29,31,35. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule, but that's unusual. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like a metal with a heavier isotope. Wait, but if X is an element, then it's a single element, so only one element is present. But the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", so X must be a compound with at least two elements.

Wait, for example, maybe X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then the elements are Na, C, O. So the lightest element is C (atomic number 6) or perhaps O (8)? No, wait, the elements are Na (11), C (6), O (8). So the lightest is C, the heaviest is Na. Their atomic masses: C is ~12, Na is ~23. 12 +23=35. That's option A)35. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

But let's check the other parts. If X is Na2CO3, reacting with Y (maybe H2SO4), would produce CO2 gas. The precipitate would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so that's not a precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is an acid that reacts with Na2CO3 and produces a precipitate. Maybe Y is a metal chloride that's not very soluble. Wait, sodium carbonate reacts with a metal chloride (like CuCl2) to produce a precipitate of the metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3 + CuCl2 → CuCO3 (precipitate) + 2 NaCl. Then, when heated, CuCO3 would decompose into CuO and CO2. The melting point of CuO is about 2265°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate itself. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So if G is, say, CaCO3, upon heating it would produce CaO and CO2. But CaO has a very high melting point. So that's not 277 K.

Wait, another thought: what if B is water? Because water freezes at 273 K (0°C), so 277 is just a bit higher. So if B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water as a gas? No, because heating would turn ice to water, then to vapor. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that's close to melting at 277 K.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction steps again. X reacts with Y → CO2 gas, precipitate G. Heating G → B. So G is a carbonate, which upon heating gives B (maybe a metal oxide) and CO2. But the melting point of B is near 277 K. That's about 4°C. So B would be a solid that melts just above 0°C. What's a solid that melts around 4°C? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's 180-something degrees. Hmm, I'm not getting this.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the product of X with a keto acid. The product contains two oxygen atoms. Suppose that product is something like ethylene glycol, which has two -OH groups, but that's three O's. Or maybe it's a molecule with two O's, like formaldehyde? No, that's H2CO, which has one O. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that doesn't add O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, formed via some addition reaction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the reaction product has two oxygen atoms. So maybe when X (a base) reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone with a carboxylic acid group?), the product is a salt with two oxygen atoms. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something. No, not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is a metal oxide with two oxygen atoms. Like CO2, but in that case, the product is a gas, which doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to make a table of possible X and Y reactions.

Gas W is CO2. So reaction is X + Y → CO2 + G (precipitate) + ... 

If X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Let's say X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. Then the reaction is Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate would be NaCl, which is soluble. So no precipitate. That doesn't fit. So maybe Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, AgNO3 reacting with Na2CO3: Na2CO3 + 2 AgNO3 → 2 NaNO3 + Ag2CO3 ↓. Ag2CO3 is a precipitate. Then, when heated, Ag2CO3 decomposes into Ag2O and CO2. What's the melting point of Ag2O? Silver oxide has a melting point around 1765°C. Not near 277 K.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide precipitate, but that would produce H2S, not CO2.

Wait, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is a sulfide. For example, Na2CO3 + S → Na2S + CO2↑ + ... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is a metal oxide. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a metal hydroxide. If X is a metal oxide reacting with an acid. For example, Na2O reacts with H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O. But that doesn't produce CO2.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to think of X as something else. If the product of X and a keto acid has 2 O atoms, perhaps X is a metal with valency +2. So when it reacts with a keto acid (like a diprotic acid?), it would form a salt with a certain number of O's.

Wait, another approach: the problem says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X. So let's say X is a compound with two elements. The lightest is, say, carbon, and the heaviest is chlorine. So 12 + 35.5 = 47.5. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are 25, 29,31,35. So perhaps the sum is 35 (option A). What elements sum to that? Let's see: 16 (O) + 19 (F) = 35? No, O is 16, F is 19, but that would be 35. Alternatively, 12 (C) + 23 (Na) =35. That's possible. So if X has C and Na, what would that be?

Wait, a compound with C and Na. Maybe sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) has Na, C, O. So the lightest element is C (6), heaviest is Na (11). Their masses are 12 and 23. Sum is 35. That's option A. But earlier I thought that X is Na2CO3, but that didn't fit the precipitate part.

Alternatively, maybe X is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3. Its elements are Na, C, O, H. So the lightest is C? No, H is lighter. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option. But maybe the problem is about the heaviest and lightest elements in X, so for NaHCO3, the elements are Na, C, O, H. Lightest is H, heaviest Na. 1+23=24. Not an option. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), a keto acid. But then reacting with a base would produce a salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a carbonate. For example, Mg reacts with CO2? Doesn't make sense. Or maybe X is a metal reacting with a carbonate to produce another carbonate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again. The options are 25,29,31,35. The sum of lightest and heaviest elements in X.

If X is NaOH, which is Na, O, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

If X is KOH, K is 39, H is 1. Sum 40. Not an option.

If X is CaO, then Ca (40) and O (16). Sum is 56. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. Like O2, but that's not a compound. Or perhaps X is something like H2O2, but that's a single element (O). No, but X is a substance, perhaps a compound.

Wait, another approach: the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. We thought CO2 fits because 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule. So if that's correct, then W is CO2.

So, going back, X and Y produce CO2. Let's think of X as a carbonate and Y as an acid. So X could be Na2CO3, Y is HCl. The reaction produces NaCl, CO2, and H2O. But the precipitate wouldn't form because NaCl is soluble. So perhaps Y is a different acid.

Wait, maybe Y is a sulfuric acid. Then, X is Na2CO3. The reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2 + H2O. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid that produces a precipitate. For example, if X is Ag2CO3 and Y is HNO3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. Wait, let's think, if X is Na2SO3, and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce SO2 gas, not CO2. So that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: What if Y is a carbonate? No, because X and Y would both be carbonates, which probably wouldn't produce CO2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate. For example, Fe reacting with Na2CO3. But that's more of a displacement reaction and I'm not sure it would produce CO2.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate. For example, if X is BaCO3 and Y is H2SO4. Then, BaCO3 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 (precipitate) + CO2 + H2O. BaSO4 is insoluble. So G would be BaSO4. Heating BaSO4 doesn't decompose; it's stable. So that doesn't fit the part where G upon heating releases B.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a nitric acid. Let's say X is a carbonate, Y is HNO3. Then, the reaction would produce CO2, but the product would be the nitrate. For example, Na2CO3 + 2 HNO3 → 2 NaNO3 + CO2 + H2O. NaNO3 is soluble. So no precipitate. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe Y is a lead nitrate solution. X is a carbonate. For example, PbCO3 + H2SO4 → PbSO4 (precipitate) + CO2 + H2O. PbSO4 is insoluble. When PbSO4 is heated, does it decompose? I'm not sure. The melting point of PbSO4 is around 1900°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another angle. The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a strong base like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid. The reaction would produce sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa. How many oxygen atoms does that have? The acetate ion has two oxygen atoms. So the product (sodium acetate) has two O's. Wait, no: the acetate ion is CH3COO^- which has two O's in the COO part. So the product has two O's. Oh, that fits! So when X (NaOH) reacts with a keto acid (like acetic acid), the product is sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So that would fit the condition.

So if X is NaOH, what about the other parts? Let me check.

NaOH (X) reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce CO2 gas, a precipitate G which upon heating gives B with a melting point near 277 K.

Wait, NaOH with an acid would produce a salt and water, not CO2. So that contradicts the earlier part about CO2 being produced.

So perhaps X is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, when reacting with an acid Y, CO2 is produced.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the product is Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. So maybe Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For example, Y could be a nitric acid, but the product would be the nitrate, which is soluble. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal sulfide. Hmm, but that would produce H2S, not CO2.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate of a different metal. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is CaCO3. But that doesn't make sense, as they are both carbonates.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, if Y is Cu(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would be Na2CO3 + Cu(NO3)2 → CuCO3 (precipitate) + 2 NaNO3. CuCO3 is a precipitate. Then, upon heating, CuCO3 might decompose into CuO and CO2. The melting point of CuO is high, around 2265°C. So that's way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, let me try to think about the problem again. The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product could be a molecule like H2O, but that has one O. Or maybe something like O2? Probably not.

Wait, another thought: when X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction. For example, if X is H2SO4, a strong acid and dehydrating agent. When a keto acid (like a dihydroxy compound) reacts with H2SO4, it could lose water and form an ester or something else. But the product would have two O's. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that reacts with a keto acid to form a salt and water. The product (salt) would have O's from the acid. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2COOH (propanoic acid?), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the part about the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 25,29,31,35. So perhaps the sum is 35, which is option A. So if X has elements with atomic masses adding to 35, which elements could those be?

35 could be 16 (O) + 19 (F) = 35. Or 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35. Or 14 (N) +21 (something else, but 21 is Sc which is not likely). Alternatively, 25 (Mg) + 10 (Ne) =35. Not sure.

So if X contains Na and C, their atomic masses sum to 35. So X could be something like Na2CO3. But earlier, that didn't fit the precipitate condition.

Wait, if X is Na2CO3, then the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 35. So that would make option A correct.

But let's check the other parts again. If X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl. Reaction produces CO2 gas, NaCl (soluble, so no precipitate). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, Y is a different acid that produces an insoluble salt. For instance, if Y is a nitric acid, but NaNO3 is soluble. Or Y is sulfuric acid, same issue.

Wait, perhaps Y is a carbonate of a different metal. For example, if Y is PbCO3, but that's probably not liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal oxide. For example, reacting Na2CO3 with a metal oxide might produce CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. For example, Mg reacts with Na2CO3 to produce MgCO3 and Na. But MgCO3 is a precipitate. Then, upon heating, MgCO3 decomposes into MgO and CO2. MgO's melting point is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should accept that X is Na2CO3 and the sum is 35, even though some parts don't fit perfectly.

Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let's think of a compound where the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements is 35. Another option is O (16) and F (19), but that's 35. So X could be OF2 or something. But OF2 is a diatomic molecule, and I'm not sure about its reactions.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like CH3COOH, but that's a keto acid, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B is a solid that melts at 277 K, perhaps B is a type of ice. But 277 K is 4°C. So maybe B is a different form of water, like ice, but ice melts at 273 K, close to 277 K. So perhaps the precipitate G is something that upon heating gives ice. Doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a melting point around 4°C, like some organic compound. But I can't think of any.

Wait, perhaps B is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different carbonate. But I'm not finding a match.

Hmm, maybe I've been on the wrong track with X being a carbonate. Let me think if X could be something else.

What if X is a hydroxide? For example, NaOH.

Then, reacting with an acid Y (like H2SO4) produces Na2SO4, water, and no CO2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a bicarbonate. Reacting with an acid would produce CO2. Let's say X is NaHCO3, and Y is HCl. The reaction would be NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + CO2 + H2O. The precipitate would be NaCl, which is soluble. So no precipitate.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the sum of atomic masses. If the sum is 35, which is option A, then the elements are C and Na. So X is Na2CO3. The sum of C (12) and Na (23) is 35. So the answer would be A)35.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with Liquid Y to produce Gas W (CO₂), a Precipitate G, and a compound B with a melting point near 277 K. Additionally, the product of X with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W (CO₂):**  
   The molecule CO₂ has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total, satisfying the condition that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. This confirms that Gas W is CO₂.

2. **Reaction of X with Y:**  
   Since CO₂ is produced, X is likely a carbonate (e.g., Na₂CO₃) reacting with an acid (e.g., HCl). The reaction could produce a precipitate (e.g., NaCl if Y is a soluble acid) or another insoluble salt, depending on Y.

3. **Precipitate G and Compound B:**  
   When G is heated, it releases B, a compound with a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests B could be a solid that melts slightly above 0°C. However, the exact identity of B remains unclear.

4. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid:**  
   The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. If X is a base like NaOH, it could react with a keto acid (e.g., acetic acid) to form a salt (e.g., sodium acetate), which contains 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X:**  
   X must contain at least two elements. Based on the options, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X sum to 35. This aligns with X being Na₂CO₃, where the lightest element is carbon (C, atomic mass ~12) and the heaviest is sodium (Na, atomic mass ~23). Their sum is 12 + 23 = 35.

6. **Verification of X as Na₂CO₃:**  
   Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) reacts with acids to produce CO₂ gas, a salt, and water. If the salt is insoluble, it forms a precipitate. Upon heating, the precipitate could decompose, though the exact nature of B remains ambiguous. Despite some uncertainties, the atomic mass condition strongly supports X as Na₂CO₃.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X sum to 35, making **Option A** the correct choice.

**Answer: A**
