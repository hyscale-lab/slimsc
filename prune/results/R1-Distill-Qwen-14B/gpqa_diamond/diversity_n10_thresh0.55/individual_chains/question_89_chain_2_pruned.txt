Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question involves several reactions and spectroscopy data, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on opposite faces or something like that.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I think when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide—it's 1 and 3 positions. So maybe it's more about dehydrohalogenation but perhaps it's a double elimination? Or maybe it's a vicinal elimination if the structure allows. Alternatively, maybe it's a double E2 reaction since KOH can abstract a beta hydrogen and eliminate two bromides.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The product after KOH is product 1. The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high chemical shift, maybe an ether or an alcohol. But wait, KOH is a strong base and can lead to elimination, but if it's a dihalide, maybe it's a double elimination to form a diene? Or perhaps it's a substitution, but with KOH, more likely elimination.

Wait, but then the IR shows a peak at 1
