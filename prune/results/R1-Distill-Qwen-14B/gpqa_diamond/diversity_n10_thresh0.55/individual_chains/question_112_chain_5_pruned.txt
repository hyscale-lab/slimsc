Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about an electron's state and some measurements involving an operator. Let me read it again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2−i)|down>. I think that means it's scaled by some normalization factor. So first, I need to normalize this state, right? Because probabilities must add up to 1.

The next part is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation A_ij is given. A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait a second, that's an interesting matrix. Let's think about the size. Since the spin is in the z-basis (up and down), the operator must be 2x2. So the matrix A has zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, no, wait. The matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i != j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would be:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] and here each element is hbar/2 instead of 1. So operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down> states. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, right? Because σ_x has those eigenstates.

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and also to find the average value of A.

But wait, the question says the eigenstates of the operator, so if I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients would give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator A is (hbar/2)σ_x, its eigenvalues are ±hbar/2. Hmm, but I'm supposed to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So the state |alpha> can be expressed as a linear combination of |
