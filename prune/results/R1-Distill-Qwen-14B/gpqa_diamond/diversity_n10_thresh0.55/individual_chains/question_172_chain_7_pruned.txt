Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in an excited state versus the ground state. I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since the energy difference (Î”E) is given as 1.38e-23 J, and E_i is higher than E_j because it's an excited state.

In this case, n_i is the number of atoms in the excited state, and n_j is the ground state. So for star_1, n_i1/n_j1 = 2 (since twice as excited), and for star_2, n_i2/n_j2 = 1 (since it's half of that? Wait, no, the question says star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So wait, the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, their ratio is 1? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for a given energy level, maybe
