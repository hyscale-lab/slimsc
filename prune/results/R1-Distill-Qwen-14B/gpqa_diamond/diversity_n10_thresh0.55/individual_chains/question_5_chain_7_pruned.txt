Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The operator is called P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is in the direction of an arbitrary vector n, which lies in the x-z plane. Oh wait, right, the x-z plane means that the direction vector n is something like (nx, 0, nz), so the y-component is zero.

The problem gives me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's like the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled similarly.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

Wait, but P is the operator along the direction n, so the operator would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's respective component. So the operator P would be n_x * Px + n_y * Py + n_z * Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector |v> such that P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Let me think about how to approach this. The operator P is a combination of Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of such an operator are ±ħ/2 times the magnitude of the direction vector, but in this case, since n is a unit vector (I assume), the magnitude is 1, so eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2. That makes sense.

So, the eigenvector we're looking for is the one with eigenvalue +ħ/2. To find this, I can write the operator P, set up the eigenvalue equation, and solve for the eigenvector.

But since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the solution should be expressed in terms of angles. Wait, but the eigenvector's direction would depend on the angle theta (since n lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something similar, depending on the convention). So perhaps we can
