Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, okay, let's try to break it down. The question is about distinguishing two energy levels based on their lifetimes. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The lifetime of a state affects how precisely we can measure its energy.

So the problem says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, the key here is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time can't be smaller than ħ over 2.

In this case, the lifetimes given are the uncertainties in time, Δt. Because each state has a different lifetime, their uncertainties in energy will vary. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states, right? So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The idea is that each state's lifetime affects how precisely we can measure its energy. A longer lifetime (more time) allows a more precise measurement of energy, meaning a smaller uncertainty in energy. Conversely, a shorter lifetime implies a larger uncertainty
