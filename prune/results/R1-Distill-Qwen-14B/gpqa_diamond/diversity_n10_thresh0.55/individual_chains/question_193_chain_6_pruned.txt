Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's see if I can figure it out. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Let me jot that down.

Right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (d), or plx = 1/d. So if the parallax is small, the star is far away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. So, plx is inversely proportional to d. That means d is inversely proportional to plx—d = 1/plx.

The problem says the number of stars (N) varies with 1/plx^5, so N = k*(1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Wait, wait. No, the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. So N ∝ (1/plx)^5.

But I need to find how N changes with distance. So I should express N in terms of d. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. Plugging that in, N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the change in N as d increases. So N increases with d^5. But wait, the options are in terms of how it scales with distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. Or perhaps it's about the density of stars as you go further.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume. Let me think. Wait, no, the question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky" changes with distance. So maybe it's about the number of stars within a certain distance range. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume depends on distance. But the problem might be relating to the number of stars per unit
