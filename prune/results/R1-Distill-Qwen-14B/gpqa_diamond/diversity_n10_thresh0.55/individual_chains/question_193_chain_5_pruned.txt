Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to move as seen from Earth when viewed from two different points in the Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) is approximately 1 divided by parallax (d ≈ 1/plx), but wait, I think the actual formula is d (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by plx (in arcseconds). So d = 1/plx.

Wait, but in this problem, the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to relate this to distance, which is d = 1/plx. So plx is 1/d. Let me substitute that in.

So, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, replacing that gives N proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ). Let's compute that: 1/(1/d^5) is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh right, that means how does N change as r (distance) increases. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases rapidly.

But wait, the options are in terms of r, which I'm assuming is the same as d, the distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then per unit of r (distance), the number of stars would scale with r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix
