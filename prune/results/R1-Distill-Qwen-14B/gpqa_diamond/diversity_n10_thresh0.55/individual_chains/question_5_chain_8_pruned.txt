Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but I remember that an eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to it.

The problem gives the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0 1; 1 0]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [0 -i; i 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1 0; 0 -1].

Wait, I think the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the vector dot product of n with P. So if n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, then n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait no, since it's in the x-z plane, the direction can be expressed with polar coordinates (θ, φ) but φ would be 0 or π? Or maybe since it's in x-z plane, perhaps the angle is with the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator along direction n would be P · n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_y component doesn't contribute. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think: n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So P_n = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Since each P component is (ħ/2) times the given matrices, substituting:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ [0 1; 1 0] + cosθ [1 0; 0 -1] ]

Let me compute that. So the matrix inside is:

sinθ * [0 1; 1 0] is
[ 0    sinθ
  sinθ 0 ]

plus cosθ * [1 0; 0 -1] is 
[ cosθ 0
  0   -cosθ ]

Adding them together:

Top left: cosθ
Top right: sinθ
Bottom left: sinθ
Bottom right: -cosθ

So the matrix becomes:
[ cosθ   sinθ ]
[ sinθ  -cosθ ]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[cosθ   sinθ ] [a]   = [a]
[sinθ  -cosθ ] [b]     [b]

Which gives the equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these as:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0  ...(1)
sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0 ...(2)

We can write this as a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

But alternatively, perhaps it's easier to solve equation (1) and (2) together.

From equation (1):

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0 → equation (1)

From equation (2
