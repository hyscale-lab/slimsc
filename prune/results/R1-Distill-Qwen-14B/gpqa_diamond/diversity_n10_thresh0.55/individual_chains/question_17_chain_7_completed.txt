Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning about these concepts. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper form for complexation. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are involved in the formation of complexes. The formula for the stability constant, or formation constant, is K_f = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait, EDTA exists in different protonated forms, right? Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about that. So I can consider that all the EDTA is in the right form.

Since the solution is stoichiometric, that means the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The question is asking for [Ca^2+], the concentration of free calcium ions.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10. So setting up the equation:

K_f = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-})

But wait, I don't know [EDTA^4-]. Hmm, but perhaps the solution is such that the EDTA is in excess, but wait, in a stoichiometric solution, maybe the EDTA and Ca are present in exactly the same molar ratio. Wait, no, because the Ca is forming a complex with EDTA. So for every mole of Ca^2+, one mole of EDTA^4- is used. But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA, that means that initially, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would have been 0.02 M each, but after the complex forms, their concentrations are lower.

Wait, wait, maybe let me think differently. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The total EDTA in solution is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, in a solution where the only Ca present is from the complex, and the pH is such that no other complexes form, then the EDTA is either free or bound as CaEDTA^2-.

But wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which presumably means that when it dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the formation constant K_f is given. So, K_f = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But because the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Now, let me denote [Ca^2+] as x, and [EDTA^4-] as y. Then, K_f = (0.02)/(x * y) = 5e10.

Wait, but in a solution where you have a complex, the total concentration of EDTA is the sum of free EDTA and the complex. But wait, in this problem, the solution is prepared with 0.02 M of the complex. So perhaps the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- were zero, and the complex is formed by adding Ca^2+ and EDTA. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K_f is 5e10, so the dissociation constant K_d would be 1/K_f, which is 2e-11.

So K_d = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

So, let me denote the concentration of Ca^2+ as x, and EDTA^4- as y. So (x * y) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

But without another equation, I can't solve for x and y. Wait, but in the solution, the only source of EDTA is the complex. So the total EDTA in solution is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2- ].

Wait, but if the solution is made by having 0.02 M of the complex, then the total EDTA is 0.02 M, assuming that all EDTA is in the complex form. Because, when you make a solution of a complex, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and perhaps the EDTA is entirely in that form. Or wait, no: when you prepare a solution, you add the necessary amounts of Ca^2+ and EDTA to form the complex. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, another approach. Since the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

Let me let s be the concentration of Ca^2+ produced. So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, s is very small). Similarly, [Ca^2+] = s and [EDTA^4-] = s.

Wait, no, because if the complex dissociates, each mole produces one mole of each. So s is the amount dissociated. So [Ca^2+] = s, [EDTA^4-] = s, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02. So plugging into K_d:

(s * s) / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So s² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5? Because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

So s is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

But wait, I made an assumption that [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M, which is valid because K is very large (so the complex doesn't dissociate much), so s is small compared to 0.02.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), the dissociation constant is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) are equal, denoted as \( s \). The concentration of the complex \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \) is approximately 0.02 M, as the dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \). Substituting into the dissociation equation:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

\[
2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{s \cdot s}{0.02}
\]

\[
s^2 = 0.02 \cdot 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
s = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
