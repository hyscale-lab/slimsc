Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about determining the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

Alright, the setup is that there are two energy levels with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. Wait, wait. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state relates to its energy uncertainty, right? I remember something about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), something like that.

So the lifetime of a state probably relates to the uncertainty in its energy. If a state has a shorter lifetime, that means it has a larger uncertainty in energy, because the time over which it's observed is smaller. So, for a very short-lived state, you can't know its energy very precisely. Conversely, a longer lifetime means a more precise energy measurement because the time uncertainty is smaller.

Now, the problem is that we have two states, and we want to clearly distinguish their energies. That means the energy difference between them needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart—they'd appear as a single energy level.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So each has its own uncertainty. So for E1, the lifetime is 10^-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * 10^-9). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 * 10^-8). Let me compute those. Oh wait, since ħ is a constant, maybe I can just compare the two uncertainties.

The lifetime of E1 is 1e-9 s, E2 is 1e-8 s. So E2's lifetime is 10 times longer than E1's. That means the uncertainty in E2's energy is smaller. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to lifetime. So E1 has a larger ΔE than E2.

So, to clearly distinguish E1 from E2, the difference in energies ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two? Or maybe the larger uncertainty?

Wait, let me think. If the energy difference is bigger than each individual uncertainty
