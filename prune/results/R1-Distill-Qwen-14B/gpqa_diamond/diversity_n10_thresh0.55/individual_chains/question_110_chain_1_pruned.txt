Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different magnitude limits. Let me think about what I know.

ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. Wait, no, wait—wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, no, wait. Oh right, typically, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than V=17, that's easier for ESPRESSO. Because higher magnitude means fainter, right? Wait, no: in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star that's magnitude 17 is fainter than one that's 16. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that means it can see stars down to 17th magnitude or brighter (so up to 17, I think). Wait, maybe I'm getting this reversed.

Wait, the statement says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, so 'brighter than 17'—so they're talking about apparent magnitude. So for example, a star that's V=16 is brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. But a star at V=18 would be fainter than 17, so it can't be observed by ESPRESSO. So the limit is V ≤17 for ESPRESSO.

Similarly for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 V mag. So only
