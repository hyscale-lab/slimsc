Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and all that. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the complexes with two SCN- ions, like [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complexes, and I remember that Co with SCN forms complexes, with different colors. The blue one is probably the [Co(SCN)_4]^2+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the complexes are usually [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The color changes with the number of ligands. I think [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue, but I might be mixing that up. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the options are about dithiocyanato, which would be two SCN. But the given stability constants are up to β4. Hmm.

Wait, the stability constants are β1 to β4, which probably correspond to the complexes with 1, 2, 3, 4 thiocyanate ligands. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^?, [Co(SCN)_3]^{2-}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}, perhaps. But I'm not certain about the charges. But that's probably not too important for calculating the percentages.

So the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, wait, no, it's the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, but I thought dithiocyanato would be two SCN. So maybe the blue ones are a different complex, but perhaps the question is just about the complexes with two SCN ligands. Or maybe the blue color is for a different n. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the question is simply asking for the percentage of the specific complex [Co(SCN)_2]^something, regardless of color. But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato", which might imply a specific complex. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the blue complex is the one with four SCN ligands. Oh, wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue, but then the dithiocyanato would be two, so perhaps the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this methodically.

The problem states that we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would be di, so two SCN groups. So perhaps the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the blue color is for [Co(SCN)_4]^3-; I think I've heard that the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex is blue. So if that's the case, then the question is about that particular complex.

Wait, but the question says "blue dithiocyanato complexes", which might not fit. Because dithiocyanato would imply two SCN. Hmm. Maybe the term is being used differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just about the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, regardless of color. But I'm a bit stuck on the color part. Maybe I should proceed regardless and see what comes up.

The main task is to calculate the percentage of the specific cobalt complex among all the cobalt species. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's a bit strange because the β values usually increase with the number of ligands, but here β3 is the highest. Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, that might mean that the most stable complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^- or something. But perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, stability constants (β) represent the equilibrium between the metal ion and the complex. For a complex with n ligands, βn is the product of the formation steps. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, β1 = [Co(SCN)^+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]. For [Co(SCN)_2]^{something}, β2 is the product of β1 times the next formation step. Wait, no, actually, βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is [CoSCNa]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]), β2 is [CoSCN^2+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2), etc.

Wait, but the way stability constants are defined, each βn is for the nth step. So for the first ligand, β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]). For the second, β2 is the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN+] and another SCN^-: so β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN^-]). Then β3 is [Co(SCN)_3^3-]/([Co(SCN)_2^2+][SCN^-]), and so on. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the previous βs. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the overall β would be β1 * β2. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have β1*β2*β3, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} would have β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, no, another approach: the overall stability constant K for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise constants up to that n. So K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, K1 = β1 =9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^something, K2= β1 * β2= 9 *40=360. For [Co(SCN)_3], K3= 9*40*63=22680. For [Co(SCN)_4], K4=9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16= 362880. So K4 is 362880.

Wait, but in reality, the stability constants could vary, but in this problem, they're given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So using that, the overall K for each complex is as I calculated.

Now, the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Assuming that refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^something, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the blue ones are the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complexes, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the blue dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? No, that's tetra, not di. Hmm, maybe I should proceed and find the fraction of each complex, then see which one corresponds to the correct percentage.

But first, the approach is to model all possible Co species, considering all possible complexes, and find their concentrations based on the stability constants and the given [SCN^-] and [Co^2+] concentrations.

The general approach is to consider the distribution of Co species in solution. The species present would be:

1. Free Co^2+ (Co^{2+}).
2. [CoSCN]^+ (n=1).
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} (n=2).
4. [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3).
5. [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} (n=4).

Each of these complexes has a certain concentration, and their proportions are determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{3-}] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

We can model each species' concentration using their respective stability constants. The stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc., which are the stepwise constants. So, the concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + (β1 β2 β3 ... βn) [SCN^-]^n )

Wait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the formation of each complex step by step. Or, perhaps use the distribution equations.

Another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the cumulative stability constants (K1, K2, K3, K4) and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

The fraction f_n of each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is given by:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Where K1 = β1 =9, K2= β1 β2= 9*40=360, K3= β1 β2 β3= 9*40*63= 22680, K4= β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, let me compute K1 through K4:

K1 = 9

K2 = 9 *40 = 360

K3 = 360 *63= 22680

K4 = 22680 *16 = 362880.

Wait, but wait, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Hmm, because the problem states that the [SCN^-] concentration is 0.1 M. So we can plug that in.

So the denominator D is 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Let me compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term1: K1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2: K2 [SCN]^2 =360 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6

Term3: K3 [SCN]^3 =22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term4: K4 [SCN]^4 =362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Adding all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9 → +3.6 →1.9 +3.6=5.5 → +22.68 →5.5+22.68=28.18 → +36.288 →28.18+36.288=64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

Now, the fraction for each complex is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / D.

Compute each f:

n=0: [Co^2+] → but K0 is 1, but n=0, so [SCN]^0=1. So f0= (1 *1)/64.468 ≈ 0.015516 (1.55%).

n=1: K1=9, [SCN]^1=0.1 → 9*0.1=0.9 → f1=0.9/64.468 ≈0.014 (approx 1.4%).

Wait, wait, no. Wait for n=1:

f1= (K1 [SCN]^1) / D → 9*0.1 = 0.9 →0.9/64.468≈0.014 →1.4%.

n=2: K2=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6 →f2=3.6 /64.468≈0.05557 →5.557%.

n=3: K3=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68 →22.68 /64.468≈0.3518 →35.18%.

n=4: K4=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288/64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%.

Wait, but wait, when I add all the fractions:

1.55% (n=0) +1.4% (n=1) +5.557% (n=2) +35.18% (n=3) +56.29% (n=4) → total is 1.55+1.4=2.95; +5.557=8.507; +35.18=43.687; +56.29=99.977%, which is roughly 100%, considering some rounding. So that looks correct.

So the fractions are approximately:

n=0: ~1.55%

n=1: ~1.4%

n=2: ~5.557%

n=3: ~35.18%

n=4: ~56.29%

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue is n=4, then the fraction would be 56.29%, but that's not one of the options. The options are 42.3, 25.6, etc. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So 5.557% → but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated the denominator D, let me re-calculate.

Given:

K1=9 → term1: 9 *0.1=0.9

K2=360 → term2: 360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

K3=22680 → term3: 22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68

K4=362880 → term4: 362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

So sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+3.6 →5.5

+22.68 →28.18

+36.288 →64.468.

That seems correct. Now for each f_n:

n=0: (1 *1) /64.468 = 1/64.468 ≈0.015516 →1.5516%

n=1: (9 *0.1)/64.468 =0.9/64.468 ≈0.014 →1.4% (exactly, 0.9 /64.468 ≈0.014 →1.4%.)

n=2: (360 *0.01)/64.468 →3.6/64.468 ≈0.05557 →5.557%.

n=3: (22680 *0.001)/64.468 →22.68/64.468 →approx 0.3518 →35.18%.

n=4: (362880 *0.0001)/64.468 →36.288/64.468 →approx 0.5629 →56.29%.

Hmm, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. If dithiocyanato is two SCN, but the blue is n=4, then the percentage is 56.29%, but that's not one of the options. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the complex with two SCN- ligands, which is n=2, so f2 is about 5.557%. But that's not an option either. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is the blue one.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-}, but then we're being asked about that. But 56.29% isn't an option either. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the stability constants in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the β values are for the formation of the complex with n ligands, but in a different order.

Wait, perhaps the β given are the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise. So for example, β1=9 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2=40 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, etc. That would change the calculations.

Wait, if that's the case, then the overall K for each complex is βn as given. So K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, that would change everything. Because then, the denominator would be sum of each K [SCN]^n.

Wait, let's recalculate the denominator in that case.

So K1=9 → [CoSCN+] = K1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

K2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

K3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3] = K3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

K4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4] = K4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

But wait, the total concentration of Co is the sum of all these species plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the fraction of each species relative to the total.

So the fraction f_n is (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN]^1 + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in reality, each K is the overall stability constant for that complex, so the expression would be:

[Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, but that's similar to the previous approach, but using the given βn as the overall K.

Wait, but in that case, K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

So let me compute each term:

n=0: 1

n=1: K1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: K2 * [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

Wait, no, wait: if K2 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_2], then [Co(SCN)_2] = K2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

But the denominator would be sum of all terms, each being K_n [SCN]^n plus 1 for the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The distribution of Co species is given by the sum of [Co^2+] and all the complex species. Each complex's concentration is K_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The fraction f_n is (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

So in that case, the denominator is D = 1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 → 1.

9*(0.1)=0.9 → sum so far 1.9

40*(0.01)=0.4 → sum 2.3

63*(0.001)=0.063 → sum 2.363

16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fractions are:

f0 = (1 *1) / D →1/2.3646≈0.4225 →42.25%.

f1= (9 *0.1)/D →0.9/2.3646≈0.381 →38.1%.

f2= (40*0.01)/D →0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

f3= (63 *0.001)/D →0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →~2.66%.

f4= (16 *0.0001)/D →0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677 →0.0677%.

So adding up all f: 42.25% +38.1=80.35 +16.9=97.25 +2.66=99.91 +0.0677≈99.98%. Close enough.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue is the di (n=2), then f2 is 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, I'm not sure if the blue is n=2 or another complex.

Alternatively, if the blue is the tetra complex (n=4), then f4 is 0.0677%, which is negligible. But that's not an option.

Wait, but in the first approach, when I assumed the βs were stepwise and K_n were the product up to βn, the fractions were n=4 being the dominant one at 56%. But in this second approach, where βn are the overall Ks, the fractions are dominated by n=0 (42%) and n=1 (38%).

But the problem states that the β1, β2, β3, β4 are the stability constants of the complexes. So which is correct? Stability constants are usually given as the overall K for each complex, not the stepwise. Because the stepwise constants are for each successive addition of a ligand. So perhaps the given βs are overall.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the stability constant βn is actually the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall K for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn. So in that case, the first approach where I multiplied the βs to get K1=9, K2=360, etc., would be correct.

So, going back to that approach, the fractions were:

n=0: 1.55%

n=1:1.4%

n=2:5.557%

n=3:35.18%

n=4:56.29%

But in that case, the dominant species is n=4. So if the blue is n=4, the percentage would be 56.29%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is the stepwise constant for the fourth ligand, but in reality, some complexes may not form or may have lower stability. Alternatively, perhaps the order of βs is different. Because here, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the stepwise constants increase up to β3 and then drop to 16 for β4. That's unusual, but possible. So in that case, the overall stability constants would be:

K1=9,

K2=9*40=360,

K3=9*40*63=22680,

K4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So the denominator D would be 1 + 9*(0.1) +360*(0.01)+22680*(0.001)+362880*(0.0001).

Calculating each term:

1 →1

9*0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9

360*0.01=3.6 → sum 5.5

22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 28.18

362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum 64.468.

So denominator D =64.468.

Fractions:

n=0: 1/64.468 ≈1.55%

n=1: 9*0.1=0.9 → 0.9/64.468≈1.4%

n=2: 360*(0.01)=3.6 →3.6/64.468≈5.557%

n=3:22680*(0.001)=22.68 →22.68/64.468≈35.18%

n=4:362880*(0.0001)=36.288 →36.288/64.468≈56.29%

So the dominant species is n=4 at 56.29%. So if the blue is the tetra complex (n=4), the percentage is ~56%, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the blue is the tri complex (n=3), which is 35.18%, still not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the dithiocyanato is n=2, which is 5.557%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the denominator for the first approach.

In the first approach, using the stepwise βs, the denominator is 64.468, and the fractions are as I computed.

But the problem is asking for the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2. So the fraction is 5.557%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the blue is not n=2 but some other n? Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the [Co(SCN)_n] complexes but about the dithiocyanate, which is the Co(SCN)_2. But I thought that's what I was calculating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the βn as the overall stability constants, not the step-wise, which would change the calculation.

Wait, let me try that. If the βn are the overall Ks, then n=1 K=9, n=2 K=40, n=3 K=63, n=4 K=16.

The denominator D would be 1 + (9*0.1) + (40*(0.1)^2) + (63*(0.1)^3) + (16*(0.1)^4).

Compute each term:

1 →1

9*0.1=0.9 → sum 1.9

40*(0.01)=0.4 → sum 2.3

63*(0.001)=0.063 → sum 2.363

16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → sum 2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

Now, the fractions are:

n=0 →1/2.3646≈42.25%

n=1 →9*0.1=0.9 →0.9/2.3646≈38.1%

n=2 →40*0.01=0.4 →0.4/2.3646≈16.9%

n=3 →63*0.001=0.063 →0.063/2.3646≈2.66%

n=4 →16*0.0001=0.0016 →0.0677%.

So the fractions are:

n=0:42.25%

n=1:38.1% → option C is 38.1%

n=2:16.9% → option D.

Hmm, so if the question is about the dithiocyanato (n=2), then 16.9% is option D. But the question says "blue dithiocyanato", and if n=2 is the blue one, then 16.9% would be the answer. But I'm not certain about the color.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue is n=1, but that's 38.1%, option C.

But I'm not sure about the color. From what I recall, the [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} is blue, which would be n=4. But in this case, when using the overall Ks, n=4 is only 0.0677%, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using [SCN] as 0.1 M, but perhaps the given [SCN] is the total, including all the complexes. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the free [SCN] is 0.1 M, but the total includes all the SCN in complexes. Hmm, but the problem says [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which usually implies the free ion concentration.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, but I need to ensure that the ligand is in excess. Let me think: if [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, and the Co is 0.01 M, then the ligand is in large excess, so the assumption that [SCN] remains approximately 0.1 M is valid.

But perhaps the problem needs to account for the fact that some of the SCN is tied up in complexes, but given that [SCN] is 0.1 M and the Co is 0.01 M, the amount in complexes would be negligible, so the approximation holds.

So, the problem is, which fraction are we being asked for? The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. If the blue is n=4, the fraction is 56.29%, which isn't an option. If the blue is n=2, it's 5.557% (not an option). Alternatively, perhaps the blue is a different complex, like n=3, which in the first approach is 35.18%, again not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order of βs wrong. Let me think again: when the βs are stepwise, K_n is the product of β1 to βn. So in the first approach, the K's are 9, 360, 22680, 362880. So in that scenario, the majority is in the n=4 complex, which is 56.29%. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the formation of [Co(SCN)_3]^- from [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ and SCN^-. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be K3= β1 * β2 * β3 =9*40*63=22680. And K4 would be β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but according to that, n=4 has a very high K, which would make it the dominant species. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is the second one, where the βs are the overall Ks for each n.

In that case, the fractions are:

n=0:42.25%

n=1:38.1%

n=2:16.9%

n=3:2.66%

n=4:0.0677%.

So the only option that matches is option C, 38.1%, which is n=1. But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato, which I think is n=2. Hmm. But in this approach, n=2 is 16.9%, option D.

But I'm not certain about the color. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement refers to the dithiocyanato as two SCN, but the blue is a different n.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the blue is the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex (n=4), which in the first approach is 56.29%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given in a way that the β represents the formation of the complex with n=1, n=2, etc., and I should model the fractions differently. Alternatively, perhaps the βn are for each individual complex, not stepwise. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of the β. Stability constants (β) can be either the overall constant for the complex or the stepwise constant for adding one ligand. So when β2 is given as 40, that could be the stepwise addition (so K2= β1 * β2), or it could be the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2].

In the first approach (stepwise), K2=360, which would make [Co(SCN)_2] the dominant species at 5.557%. But according to the options, perhaps the correct answer is 38.1% (option C), which corresponds to n=1 when using the β as the overall K.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be n=2. So unless the problem is using a different approach, like the βs are the overall Ks, and n=2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the process again.

In the first approach, where βs are stepwise, the fractions are dominated by n=4. No option matches that.

In the second approach, where βs are overall, the dominant species is n=0 (42.25%) or n=1 (38.1%). So n=2 is 16.9%.

The options include 38.1% and 16.9%. So if the question is about n=2, the answer would be 16.9%, option D. But then why is the answer not matching any of the options except D? Because in the second approach, n=2 is 16.9%, option D.

But the question says "blue dithiocyanato". If the blue is the tetra complex, then the second approach's fraction for n=4 is 0.0677%, which isn't an option. If the blue is n=1, then 38.1% (option C) would be the answer. Alternatively, if the blue is n=3, then it's 2.66%, which isn't an option.

I think I must have made a mistake in the approach. Let's try another approach.

Perhaps the problem is considering the stability constants as the formation of the complexes in a different manner. For example, perhaps the βn represent the overall formation constants, but the calculation considers the concentration of free Co^2+.

Wait, another method: The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n )

But wait, that formula uses the product of βs up to n for the numerator and denominator.

So, with [Co^2+] =1e-2 M, [SCN^-]=0.1 M.

So the denominator would be:

D = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4.

Compute each term:

β1=9 → term1=9 *0.1=0.9

β1β2=9*40=360 → term2=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

β1β2β3=9*40*63=22680 → term3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68

β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=362880 → term4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880*0.0001=36.288

Sum D =1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

The numerator for each species is:

For n=2: β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 → (360) * (1e-2) * (0.1)^2 =360 *1e-2 *0.01=360 *1e-4=0.036.

But wait, no, the fractions are based on the concentration of each species divided by the total. The denominator D is the sum of the terms, each being β1β2...βn [SCN]^n. So the fraction for n=2 is (β1β2[SCN]^2) / D.

So f2 = (360 *0.01) /64.468 →3.6/64.468≈0.05557 →5.557%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is not about n=2.

Wait, but the problem says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So if the blue is n=4, then 56.29%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue refers to a different complex. Maybe the dithiocyanato is n=2, and the blue is another complex. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dithiocyanato but about the tetra-thiocyanato complex. But the term used is dithiocyanato, which implies two SCN. So I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, regardless of color. But that would be n=2, which is 5.557% in the first approach, but 16.9% in the second approach.

Wait, in the second approach, where βn are the overall Ks, the fraction for n=2 is 16.9% (option D), which is present in the options.

So the answer would be D)16.9%.

But I'm not entirely certain because I'm not sure whether the βs are stepwise or overall.

Wait, in the problem statement, the βs are given as the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. So each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_1]^+, β1=9; for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, β2=40; etc.

So in that case, the approach where we treat the βs as the overall Ks, and compute the fractions as:

f_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which gives the fractions as:

n=0:42.25%

n=1:38.1%

n=2:16.9%

n=3:2.66%

n=4:0.0677%.

So if the question is about the dithiocyanato (n=2), the answer is 16.9%, option D.

But the question mentions "blue" dithiocyanato. If the blue is a different n, perhaps the answer is different. However, based on the given options, 16.9% is an option (D), and it's the only one matching when βs are treated as overall Ks.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species in the solution. The problem provides the stability constants \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \), along with the concentrations \([Co^{2+}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\) and \([SCN^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\).

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants Interpretation**: The given \( \beta \) values are treated as the **overall stability constants** for the complexes \([Co(SCN)_n]\), where \( n \) is the number of thiocyanate ligands. This means:
   - \( \beta_1 = 9 \) corresponds to \([CoSCN^+]\),
   - \( \beta_2 = 40 \) corresponds to \([Co(SCN)_2]\),
   - \( \beta_3 = 63 \) corresponds to \([Co(SCN)_3]\),
   - \( \beta_4 = 16 \) corresponds to \([Co(SCN)_4]\).

2. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [SCN^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [SCN^-] + \beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN^-]^4}
   \]
   where \( f_n \) is the fraction of the complex \([Co(SCN)_n]\).

3. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator \( D \) is the sum of all terms:
   \[
   D = 1 + \beta_1 [SCN^-] + \beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   D = 1 + (9 \times 0.1) + (40 \times 0.1^2) + (63 \times 0.1^3) + (16 \times 0.1^4)
   \]
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction Calculations**:
   - For \( n = 0 \) (free \( Co^{2+} \)):
     \[
     f_0 = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%)
     \]
   - For \( n = 1 \) (\([CoSCN^+]\)):
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [SCN^-]}{D} = \frac{9 \times 0.1}{2.3646} = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.381 \, (38.1\%)
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \) (\([Co(SCN)_2]\)):
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [SCN^-]^2}{D} = \frac{40 \times 0.1^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%)
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \) (\([Co(SCN)_3]\)):
     \[
     f_3 = \frac{\beta_3 [SCN^-]^3}{D} = \frac{63 \times 0.1^3}{2.3646} = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%)
     \]
   - For \( n = 4 \) (\([Co(SCN)_4]\)):
     \[
     f_4 = \frac{\beta_4 [SCN^-]^4}{D} = \frac{16 \times 0.1^4}{2.3646} = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000677 \, (0.0677\%)
     \]

5. **Verification**: The sum of all fractions is approximately \( 42.25\% + 38.1\% + 16.9\% + 2.66\% + 0.0677\% = 99.98\% \), which is consistent with the total cobalt concentration.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the percentage of the **blue dithiocyanato complexes**. Based on the given data, the blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \( n = 2 \) (\([Co(SCN)_2]\)), which has a fraction of \( 16.9\% \).
