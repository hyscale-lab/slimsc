Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to think about how special relativity affects things.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The task is to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) is (1/2)kA², which converts to kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So solving that gives v_max as sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But since this is relativistic, that can't be the case, right? So option C is probably incorrect.

Relativistically, the energy might be different. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the potential energy in relativistic harmonic oscillator... I'm not too sure about that. Let me think.

Wait, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², even in relativistic contexts, I think. But the kinetic energy equation changes. In relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. But
