Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I should normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized so that the total probability is 1.

So, the state is given as |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To find the normalization factor, I need to compute the inner product of this state with itself. The inner product would be (1+i)^* * (1+i) + (2 - i)^* * (2 - i). Wait, no, wait. Because when you compute the inner product, you take the conjugate of each component.

So, the normalization factor squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Let's calculate that.

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because the magnitude of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), so square is a² + b².

Similarly, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So adding them together, 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, all divided by sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the state is proportional to that. So actually, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> multiplied by some constant to make it normalized. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because (1/sqrt(7))^2 times (2+5) is 7*(1/7) =1.

So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about the dimensions.

Wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix because the state is in two
