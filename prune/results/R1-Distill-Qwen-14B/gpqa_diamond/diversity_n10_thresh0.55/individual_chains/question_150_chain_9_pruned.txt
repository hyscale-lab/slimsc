Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we're supposed to identify the final product after a series of reactions. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I'll analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. Then, I'll think about what each reagent does in sequence.

Starting with the NMR:

The 1H-NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a pretty downfield shift. Aldehydes or maybe something with an aromatic ring and an electronegative group, like a nitro group? Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Nitro groups are NO2, but we have NO here, which would be a nitroso or something else. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents and an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet. This could be part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. For example, if there's a substituent that deshields the protons, like next to an electron-withdrawing group.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. Since it's 2H, and the previous one is also 2H, perhaps these are part of two aromatic rings, perhaps para-substituted in each. Or maybe it's a vinyl group, but the integration is 2H each, so more likely aromatic.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some substitution that makes the protons broad, like an -OH group nearby. Wait, but the formula doesn't have an -OH yet. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol structure or something with an adjacent substituent causing the broadness.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet around 3.66 ppm. This is in the range of a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something similar. The doublet suggests coupling with another proton, so perhaps the CH2 is between two similar groups.

So putting this together, let me think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation: could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an amine or something else (1). Alternatively, another arrangement.

Wait, another approach: C8H9NO. Let me consider possible structures. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with
