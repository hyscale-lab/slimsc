Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's subjected to a series of reactions, and I have to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I think I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The NMR is 1H, so it's proton NMR.

The NMR data points are:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I'll try to interpret each of these signals.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm, especially as triplets if they're next to a CH2 group. Wait, but in the case of an aldehyde, the adjacent group would be the carbonyl, so maybe it's another scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with adjacent coupling, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton like from an aromatic ring, but that's less likely.

Then, the 6.98 ppm d (2H) and 6.51 ppm d (2H) look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest they're part of a para-substituted aromatic ring. For instance, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would couple with each other, leading to doublets. So, maybe this is two para-substituted benzene rings or a single benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

The 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet. Broad signals can be due to exchange with other protons, like in an -OH group, but with two protons, maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some coupling, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene system or an aromatic ring with substituents that cause the protons to be deshielded but not split into a specific pattern.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a doublet. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. The splitting suggests that each of the two protons is next to another CH2, but wait, no, each H is adjacent to two others. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 next to a carbonyl or an oxygen. Wait, if it's an OCH2 group, the typical shift is around 3-4 ppm, which matches. Also, if the CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an aldehyde, then the coupling might be with the aldehyde proton. Wait, but the aldehyde is at 9.72, which is a triplet. So, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to the aldehyde. So, maybe the structure is something like R-O-CH2-CHO.

But
