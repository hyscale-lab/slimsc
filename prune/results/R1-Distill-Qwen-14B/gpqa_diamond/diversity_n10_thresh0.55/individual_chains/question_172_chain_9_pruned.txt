Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question is about two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in their photospheres have different excitation levels. Star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, the specific energy level is excited twice as much. I think that relates to the excitation energy or maybe the partition function.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Right, the energy difference Î”E is known. Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy states. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n_i and n_j) is given by (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh wait, I think the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i is higher than E_j. So if the energy level is higher, it has lower population.

In this case, star_1's atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Does that mean the population is twice as much, or that each atom has twice the excitation energy? Probably, the population. Because in excitation, higher population in a higher energy level indicates more excitation.

So for star_1, the population n1 is twice that of star_2's n2. So n1/n2 = 2. Or is it
