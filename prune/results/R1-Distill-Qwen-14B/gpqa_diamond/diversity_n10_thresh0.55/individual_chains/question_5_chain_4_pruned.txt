Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

First, I need to understand what the operator P looks like. The problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with elements [0,1; 1,0]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [0,-i; i,0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [1,0;0,-1].

Wait, but the operator in question is P, which I assume is the component along the direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) since it's in the x-z plane (y-component is zero). But since the direction is arbitrary, maybe the eigenvector corresponds to spin-up along that direction.

In quantum mechanics, the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle (like a muon) along an arbitrary axis can be written as a combination of the Pauli matrices. The general form is P = ħ/2 * (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = ħ/2 (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

But wait, the problem is asking for the eigenvector of operator vec{P} along n. So I think the operator P is the component along n, which would be the dot product of vec{P} and vec{n}. So, P = n · vec{P}, which would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the question says the operator is vec{P}, which is a vector operator. Hmm, perhaps the operator in question is the component along n, so the operator is (n · vec{P}), which would be a scalar operator. That's probably what I'm dealing with.

So, our operator is
