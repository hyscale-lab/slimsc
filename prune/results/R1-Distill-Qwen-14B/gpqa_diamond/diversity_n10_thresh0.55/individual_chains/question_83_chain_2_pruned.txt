Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh right, dilution changes the concentration. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. Wait, volume is in cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, because 20+20=40 cm³.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, reacting with acetic acid, which is a weak acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So at equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be converted to acetate ions.

But the question has two parts: pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. Let's tackle each one.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the solution will be the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So it'll hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

Wait, but wait. The solution at equivalence point is a solution of sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate ions will determine the pH. Let me find the concentration first.

The moles of NaOH added at equivalence will equal the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles of acetic acid were 0.001 moles, so moles of NaOH will be same. The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.
