Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a given concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium to form a complex. The problem states that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stoichiometric here probably means that each EDTA molecule binds one Ca ion, so the ratio is 1:1.

The key thing here is the formation constant, K. The formation constant (K) for the complex is given as 5x10^10. Wait, I think the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where metal and EDTA form the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- with a K value of 5e10.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). But wait, sometimes people use different forms, like the conditional formation constant, but the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5e10, so I'll go with that.

The solution is ideal pH, so I don't have to worry about activity coefficients or anything. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard conditions, so the K is given at that temp.

The solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, assuming that the solution is at equilibrium, some of the complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, since K is very large (5e10), that means the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be minimal, right? So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be really low.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, if the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, what's the [Ca²+]?

Hmm. Let's think about the equilibrium. The complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The K for this reaction is 1/K_f, since K_f is the formation constant. Because the formation constant is the reverse of this dissociation. So K_d (dissociation) is 1
