Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d), so p = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases. So if p is small, the stars are far away, and if p is large, they're closer.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So I'm looking for N(p) per some Δp. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I'm assuming that their actual density in space is uniform, but how does that translate to parallax?

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky... Oh wait, no, wait. Uniformly distributed in space, not just on the sky. So the number density of stars is uniform with distance. That is, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density.

But how does parallax relate to this? Parallax p is 1/d. So d = 1/p. Let me substitute that into the expression. So the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p would be n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). But wait, dr is related to dp since d = 1/p, so dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases
