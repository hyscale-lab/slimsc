Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact properties. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, wait, that looks like it's written in some coordinates, probably x and y. So I'm guessing this is a 2-dimensional metric because there are only dx² and dy² terms. 

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. So, I remember that for surfaces in different geometries, the area can be calculated using the metric. Since this is a 2D metric, the area would be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But I might not need to do the integral if there's a simpler way.

Wait, another thought: the metric might be conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of (dx² + dy²). That scalar is 32/(4 - x² - y²), which suggests the metric is conformally related to the flat Euclidean metric. So maybe this surface is a hyperbolic space or part of it.

In conformal coordinates, the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal and each component is multiplied by the same factor, the determinant would be [32/(4 - r²)]², where r² = x² + y². So the square root of the determinant would be
