Okay, so I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both planets are around stars with the same mass as the Sun, and they both have masses similar to Neptune. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method, which detects the shift in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But wait, since both planets are in circular orbits, I guess inclination might not matter here because the maximum Doppler shift occurs when the orbit is edge-on, but since both are detected, maybe they have similar inclinations or the effect is negligible for this calculation.

The problem states that the spectral line shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. But I'm a bit confused because higher velocity would lead to a larger shift. So, a larger shift (7) would mean a higher velocity, which probably implies a more massive planet or a shorter orbital period. But wait, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are the same. That means the velocity must be related to the orbital period.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. Let me think about the RV method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p)^2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (P) ) ]^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )

But since the planets are Neptune-sized and the stars are Sun-like, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. And e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (1/P)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3). But since M_p << M_*, this becomes approximately (M_p / M_*) * (1/P)^(1/3).

But wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) )) ) / (2πc )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is twice the planet's velocity in the center of mass (since M_* >> M_p, the star's velocity is approximately K = (v_p) * (M_p/M_*) ), but wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, when two masses orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is K = (v_p) * (M_p/(M_* + M_p)). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, this is roughly K ≈ v_p * (M_p / M_*). But M_p is the same for both planets, and M_* is same for both stars, so K is proportional to v_p.

But how does v
