Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I need to find which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, so S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar. Oh wait, sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So, S must be sigma_y. Therefore, S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something? Or exactly that. So, the operator Ay is c times sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma matrices are related to spin operators. Spin-½ particles have spin operators proportional to sigma matrices. So, if S is sigma_y, then Ay = c * sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are known. I think they're plus and minus 1. Because for Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues are ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1. So then, Ay, which is c times sigma_y, would have eigenvalues c*(±1).

Wait, what's c? c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and
