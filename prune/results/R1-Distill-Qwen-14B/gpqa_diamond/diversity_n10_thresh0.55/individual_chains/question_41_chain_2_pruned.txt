Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is, relative to the lab's observer.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? But since the medium itself is moving, does that affect the observed speed? I'm a bit confused because I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but this is when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

So, the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the glass's velocity v is in the same direction as the light's propagation. So how does that combine?

I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Oh wait, but is that necessary? Because
