Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. It says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the options give different dependencies on distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula I think is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, more precisely, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/(distance in parsecs). Or something like that. So if I'm not mistaken, distance r (let's say in parsecs) would be r = 1/plx. Because if parallax is small, the distance is large. Right.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we have N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Wait, because plx = 1/r, so plx is inversely proportional to r.

So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. If N = k * (1/plx^5), and plx = 1/r, then N = k * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when you look at a larger volume of space, you'd expect more stars, but the rate depends on the density. Oh, right! The number of stars depends on both the volume and the stellar density. So if the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5, which is proportional to r^5
