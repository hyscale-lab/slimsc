Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. And we're assuming the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies here.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, and ΔE is the energy difference between them. But wait, the problem is about the ratio when spots are present versus when they're not. So the ratio in the two cases (no spots: R1, spots: R2) is R1/R2, which we need to find.

Wait, but the star's effective temperature when spotted is 5500 K, but the spots themselves are cooler, right? Because starspots are darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Oh wait, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the Teff of the entire star is lower when spots are present. So the photosphere's temperature has changed, which affects the Boltzmann ratio.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Are the spots at a lower temperature than the rest, and the overall Teff is an average? Or does the problem model the entire photosphere at 5500 K when spots are present? Maybe I should think of the entire photosphere
