Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let me read the problem again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to choose between options A to D, each giving different A and B. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

Hmm. Let's tackle the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. It's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, it's probably undergoing nucleophilic addition.

In the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Wait, but butan-2-one has a ketone group. So what's happening here? Oh, wait, maybe it's a condensation reaction or some kind of addition followed by elimination.

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN... I'm a bit confused. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In the presence of a ketone, the CN- might attack the carbonyl carbon in a nucleophilic addition. So the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group are added to the carbonyl carbon.

So the product here has both an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. That matches with the product 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin from the ketone.

So, the reagent conditions for forming a cyanohydrin. I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins typically involves the use of a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the carbonyl is usually attacked by the nucleophile in a two-step process, but the acid helps in the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

So, in the first step, butan-2-one reacts with H+ from the acid (reagent A), which protonates the carbonyl oxygen. Then the CN- (from NaCN) attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water (or another nucleophile) might come in, but in this case, since we're getting a cyanohydrin, I think the reaction stops after the initial addition. Wait, no, because the product has both -OH and -CN. So perhaps
