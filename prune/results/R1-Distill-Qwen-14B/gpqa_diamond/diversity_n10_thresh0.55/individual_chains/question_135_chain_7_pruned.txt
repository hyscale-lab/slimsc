Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to determine which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm. So the first thing I remember is that decay processes depend on the mass of the particle and the masses of the possible decay products. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson. Because in particle physics, you can't create something out of nothing, so energy and mass conservation must hold.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian here looks like it's describing an interaction term. So the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions. The term is -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So I think this is the Yukawa coupling kind of term. The fermion ψ_f couples to the scalar field X. So the interaction is between X and fermions ψ_f. But wait, the term also has a υ, which I'm guessing is a constant (like the vacuum expectation value?), but maybe that's part of the potential or the mass term. Hmm, perhaps the mass term for the fermion comes from υ, and X is the fluctuation around it.

Wait, but for the decay, I think I can ignore the υ part because when X decays, it's the X field that's involved. So the relevant interaction is the coupling between X and the fermion ψ_f.

So the decay process would be X → ψ_f + ψ_f-bar (since the interaction term is ψ̄ X ψ, which is like X ψ ψ̄). So the X boson can decay into a pair of fermions ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

Now, the question is about which fermions ψ_f are available for X to decay into. So whatever fermions are in the theory, X can decay into them if their mass is less than X's mass.

But wait, the problem says the boson's mass is 6 GeV. So any pair of fermions
