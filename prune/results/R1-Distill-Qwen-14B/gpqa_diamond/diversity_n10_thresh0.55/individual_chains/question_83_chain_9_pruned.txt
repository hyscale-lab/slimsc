Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, but I need to calculate the values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a weak acid-strong base titration. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Wait, but when we dilute the acetic acid with water, the concentration changes. Let me figure that out first.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 mL, and the concentration is 0.05 M. So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

Then we add 20 mL of water. So the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is moles/volume, so 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, that makes sense because when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we start titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The first thing I need is the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Or maybe it's the percentage of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Hmm, I think it's the former: 25% of the acetic acid has reacted.

Let me think: the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.
