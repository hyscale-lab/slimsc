Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula doesn't look familiar, but I can try to figure out possible structures. The NMR data is provided, which should help identify the structure.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehydes usually have a singlet because there's only one proton. Unless it's part of a conjugated system, maybe. Or perhaps it's an enol form or something else. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like an enal.
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted, especially since it's a doublet. Maybe two equivalent aromatic protons in a para position.
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. If the first set is para, this might be another para-substituted group. So maybe two different aromatic rings attached?
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H): Broad signals often indicate exchange, maybe hydroxyl protons. But wait, 2H as a singlet? That's a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton in a conjugated system, but the broadness makes me think of OH groups that are exchanging (like in phenol derivatives). Or maybe it's a diene or something else. Or maybe these are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something with two adjacent OH groups? Not sure yet.
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H): This is a quartet? No, it's a doublet. So maybe CH2 groups next to an oxygen. Or perhaps a methylene adjacent to an oxygen atom, like in an ether or ester. The chemical shift around 3.6 ppm suggests something like OCH2. So maybe an OCH2CH group or something similar.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde group. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. The formula has 8
