Okay, let me try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about an electron in a state described by |alpha>, and we're supposed to find the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. Okay, let's start breaking it down step by step.

First, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means there's a normalization factor. So I should probably normalize this state first.

The normalization factor comes from the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. Let's compute that. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2 -i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Calculating |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space. So for a spin-1/2 system, the up and down states form a basis. The state |alpha> is written in terms of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization is indeed sqrt( (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ) over the denominator.

Wait, let me calculate that again. The normalization factor squared is |(1+i)/sqrt(7)|² + |(2 -i)/sqrt(7)|².

Which is ( (1^2 +1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) ) /7.

So that's (2 +5)/7=7/7=1. So that's correct.

Next, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So matrix A is:
[ [0, ħ/2],
  [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So A = (ħ/2) * σ_x.

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes, A is (ħ/2) times that. So eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, because it's just a scalar multiple.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? Oh right, they are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, but in this problem, we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities would be the square of the amplitude when |alpha> is projected onto these states.

So the first step is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Let me write |alpha> in terms of |up> and |down>.

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>.

But |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So let's compute a and b.

Express |alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (a + b)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (a - b)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Set this equal to |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

Therefore, the coefficients must match.

So:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)   ... (1)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)  ... (2)

So we have two equations:

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)   ... (1a)
a - b = (2-i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)   ... (2a)

Now, adding (1a) and (2a):

2a = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Simplify numerator: 1+2 =3; i -i=0. So 3.

So 2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
a = (3 sqrt(2) )/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Similarly, subtracting (2a) from (1a):

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Simplify inside: 1-2= -1; i +i=2i. So -1 +2i.

So 2b = (-1 +2i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
b= (-1 +2i) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is |a|^2, and for |-x> it's |b|^2.

Calculate |a|^2:

a = 3 sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)).

So |a|^2 = (9 * 2 )/(4 *7) )= (18)/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |b|^2:

b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator's magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5.

So |b|^2 = (5 * 2 )/(4 *7) )= 10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.35714.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357. Sum is 14/14=1, correct.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which would be approximately 9/14 ≈0.642857 and 5/14≈0.357. So A's probabilities are close.

But let's get exact values.

Wait,
