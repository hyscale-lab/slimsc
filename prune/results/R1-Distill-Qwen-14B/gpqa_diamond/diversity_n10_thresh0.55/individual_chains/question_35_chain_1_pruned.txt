Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work it out step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S has a specific form. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices, which are 2x2 matrices. Oh wait, S might be similar to a Pauli matrix.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz is diagonal. Oh yeah, so the given S matrix is exactly the σy matrix because the first row is [0, -i] and the second [i, 0]. So S is σy.

So Ay is c multiplied by σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Because c is h/(4π), right? So let's write that out. σy is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

[ 0    -(h/(4π))i ]
[(h/(4π))i    0 ]

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to solve the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Wait, but for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0.

Let's write the matrix (Ay - a I):

[ -a      -(h/(4π))i ]
[(h/(4π))i      -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (h/(4π))i * -(h/(4π))i ].

So determinant = a² - [ (h/(4π))² * i² ].

But wait, i squared is -1, so:

Determinant = a² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) * (-1) ) ].

Which is a² + (h²)/(16 π²).

Set this equal to zero for eigenvalues: a² + (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = - (h²)/(16 π²).

Taking square roots, a = ± (h/(4π)) * i.

Wait, wait a minute. That's interesting. So the eigenvalues are purely imaginary: a = ±i (h/(4π)).

Hmm, looking at the options, let's check what's stated about the eigenvalues.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't fit. Because our eigenvalues are purely imaginary, their real parts are zero, not h/(4π). So A is incorrect.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me compute the actual eigenvalues.

Wait, our calculation says a = ± i (h/(4 π)). So the eigenvalues are (
