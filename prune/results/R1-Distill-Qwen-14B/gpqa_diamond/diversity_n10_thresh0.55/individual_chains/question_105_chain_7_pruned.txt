Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about figuring out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with dark spots.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots that have a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes that look like an exoplanet transiting. The question is, what exoplanet radius would mimic this effect in terms of the light curve's amplitude?

Wait, so if the spots are causing a variation, we need to compare that to the variation caused by an exoplanet. Both would block some light when they pass in front, but the way the light changes might be different because spots are cooler regions on the star itself.

I think the approach is to calculate the maximum change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same delta F.

Let me think about the star's light. The star emits flux, and the total flux depends on its surface area and temperature. The star has a radius R, let's say R is equal to that of the Sun, but the exact value might not matter as it's a ratio we're looking for.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is cooler. The spots have a filling factor f (which is 20% or 0.2), and their temperature is Teff - 1000K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

But wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K? Or is it a drop of 1000 K, so 5000? That's correct.

Now, the flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The spots have a flux F_spot = σ(T_spot)^4. The difference in flux per unit area is (F0 - F_spot) multiplied by the area of the spots.

The total flux from the star when spots are visible on one hemisphere would be F_total = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f. The fractional
