Okay, so I have this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit odd. Wait, 32 over (4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric tensor usually has components g_xx, g_yy, etc., and for a 2D metric, it's something like ds² = g_xx dx² + 2g_xy dx dy + g_yy dy². In this case, it's diagonal, so cross terms are zero, and the g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So, the metric is conformally flat, I think.

Wait, the problem is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere means it has negative curvature, right? Or wait, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the term is being used in a different way here, like a 2D surface embedded in 3D space with a metric like this.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, perhaps the pseudosphere here is a 2D surface, and we're to compute its area from the given metric.

Alternatively, maybe the metric represents a 2D space, so the area is the integral over the surface of the square root of determinant of the metric. But wait, the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So for a metric that's diagonal, the determinant is g_xx * g_yy, since the off-diagonal terms are zero. So, det g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]², because g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element would be sqrt( [32/(4 - x² - y²)]² ) dx dy, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait, 32 squared is 1024, but the square root of that is 32, right? So the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. But wait, actually, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))²,
