Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. So the relative speed isn't as simple as 0.6c - 0.5c. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh yes, the relative velocity u' of one object from the frame of another is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the moving object and v is the velocity of the other frame. But wait, in this case, which object's frame are we considering? Oh right, the problem is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts. So I need to find the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the relative speed in the rest frame of one astronaut, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me get that straight.

Let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and is moving at 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m and is moving at 0.5c. Both are moving in the same direction. So from A's frame,
