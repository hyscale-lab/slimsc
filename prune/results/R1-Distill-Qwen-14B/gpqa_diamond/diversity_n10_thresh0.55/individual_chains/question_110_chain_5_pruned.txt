Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different brightness limits, so I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

Let me start by recalling the given information. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17.0 mag. Wait wait, no, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, but in astronomy, lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So wait, if a star has a V magnitude less than 17, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16.0 mag, so their V magnitude must be less than 16.

So the key is each star's apparent V magnitude. Because only stars that are bright enough (apparent magnitude ≤ 16 for HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO) can be detected. But wait, wait. Wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO"—so if a star's apparent V is less than 17, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Same for HIRES: brighter than 16, so apparent V ≤16.

So for a star to be detectable by both, it needs to have apparent V mag ≤16. Because if it's ≤16, ESPRESSO (which goes up to 17) can see it, and HIRES can also see it. But if a star is between 16 and 17, it can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So the star must be ≤16 in apparent V.

Wait, but wait—apparent magnitude is what matters here, right? Because that's how bright they appear from Earth. So each star's apparent V mag needs to be determined.

Looking at the options:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, at 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So Star1 is at 10 pc, so its apparent magnitude (m) is the same as its absolute mag, so m =15.5. So for Star1: m=15.5. That's less than 16, so HIRES can see it. Also, less than
