Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given data includes their radii, masses, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest, and their radial velocities. The question is about finding the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, let me list the given information:

- Radius of Star_1 (R1) is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R2). So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Mass of Star_1 (M1) is also 1.5 times that of M2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest (λ_max) are the same. So λ1_max = λ2_max.
- Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm.
- They are black body radiators, so I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law perhaps.

Wait, the question is about luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared times its temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan constant.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1² is (2.25 R2²).

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4

But what about the temperatures? How do I find T1 and T2?

Well, another thing given is that the wavelengths at which they are brightest (λ_max) are the same. Wien's displacement law says λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

So if λ1_max = λ2_max, then T1 = T2. Wait, because λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Wait, no wait. If λ_max is the same,
