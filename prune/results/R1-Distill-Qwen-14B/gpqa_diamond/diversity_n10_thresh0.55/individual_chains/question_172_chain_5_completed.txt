Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, I think this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is the Boltzmann constant, right? Because Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k multiplied by the temperature difference term, maybe?

Wait, the question says the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, that means ΔE equals k times something. Let me think, ΔE = k * (something). Oh yeah, the Boltzmann factor involves ΔE and the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). So in this case, star_1 has twice as excited, meaning the population in the higher energy level is higher. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 times (n_upper2 / n_lower2) because star_1's atoms are twice as excited.

Wait, actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is higher, implying more in the higher energy state. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher for star_1. Let me define the excitation as the number in the excited state, so for star_1, n_upper is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited", which I think refers to the population in the excited state. So perhaps n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2.

But wait, the Boltzmann factor is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for each star, the ratio depends on their respective temperatures. Let me define the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 and R2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

Given that, the problem says R1 = 2 * R2? Or wait, no. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

But R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So substituting R1 = 2 R2:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange that:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE /k:

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 is a term. Let me factor that.

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k.

So ΔE = k → substituting:

k/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So the k cancels out:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but let me double-check the signs. Let's go back to the equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Bring terms with ΔE to one side:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Since ΔE is k, then:

[ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). Let's see:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) )

So yeah, that's correct.

So:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, option D is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, that's what we derived.

Wait, but looking at the equation again, I have 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2), which is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which matches option D.

So the correct equation should be ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels, and the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which matches the Boltzmann constant \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \).

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations in two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Since the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2, the ratio of excitation is:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2)
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2)
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
