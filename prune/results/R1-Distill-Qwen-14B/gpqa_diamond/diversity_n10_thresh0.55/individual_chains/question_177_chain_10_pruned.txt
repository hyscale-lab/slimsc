Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

From what I remember, luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

The problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but how does mass relate here? Well, if they are main-sequence stars, their masses and luminosities are related, but maybe that's a red herring here because the question explicitly says to assume they radiate as black bodies. So the mass might not directly affect the luminosity calculation, unless we're considering other factors like temperature.

Wait, the problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

So both stars have the same temperature. That simplifies things. Because then, the luminosity difference comes entirely from their radii.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So it's (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Hmm, that would point to option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but the question mentions radial velocities. Oh right, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, but in this
