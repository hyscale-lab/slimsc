Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. Oh right, the pp chain has different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. The question is about the pp-III branch stopping.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. That's the time it takes for sunlight to reach Earth, right? So any neutrinos produced after that time would come from the other parts of the Sun, not the pp-III branch.

Neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges based on the reactions. So, if pp-III stops, which neutrinos are affected? I think the pp-III branch is related to producing higher-energy neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces the highest-energy neutrinos, like around 1 MeV or so. Because in the pp-I and pp-II branches, the neutrinos are lower in energy.

So the question is about the flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Wait, pp-III probably contributes more to higher energies, so band 2 is higher energy than band 1.

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would drop. But what about band 1? Are those neutrinos from other branches?

I think the pp-I and pp-II branches produce neutrinos in lower energy ranges. So when pp-III stops
