Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's see what the question is. 

So, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, right? And each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection is done via the RV method, which looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The problem gives me two planets, #1 and #2. For each, there's a shift in the spectral line—5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, P2/P1 equals what?

Wait, I think the RV method's shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) is given by something involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. Or maybe it's K = (v) which is related to the orbital speed of the star.

The formula I recall is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, no, maybe think in terms of the Doppler shift. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to the velocity (v) via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. So the velocity of the star is proportional to the shift. 

So for planet #1, the velocity is v1 = (Δλ1) / λ * c. Similarly, v2 = (Δλ2 / λ) * c. Since the same wavelength is used for both, the ratio of velocities is v2/v1 = Δλ2/Δλ1 =7/5=1.4. So v2 is 1.4 times v1.

But wait, what's the relationship between the velocity and the orbital period? I think the velocity of the star (v) is given by the formula v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ). Oh, but since the planet's mass is much less than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also
