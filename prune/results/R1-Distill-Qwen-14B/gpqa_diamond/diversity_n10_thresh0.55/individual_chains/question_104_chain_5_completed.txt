Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The key part is about the periodic shifts in their spectral lines detected by the RV method.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms (that's 5e-3 angstroms, I think). Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

Wait, the formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K of the velocity. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M_p)^0.5 * (P) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * something... Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to think.

Oh, right! The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something) ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting the exponents wrong here. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) )^(1/1) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait another approach. Since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and planets have same mass (Neptune-like), but their RV shifts are different. Wait, the shift is related to the velocity of the star. So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is measured as the shift in the spectral lines per unit time.

So, for a given planet, a higher K means larger velocity. But wait, K depends on the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star. But in this case, the star's mass is same for both, and the planet's mass is same as well. So, the only varying factor is the period. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, the formula for K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / (sqrt(P) ) ), or something like that. Wait, I might be mixing up the exponents.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K. The correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) / (P^(1/3) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can simplify the problem by considering that both stars are the same mass, and the planets have the same mass. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so 1-sqrt(1-e²) is 1. So, that part drops out.

So, for circular orbits, the formula simplifies. Let me write it again.

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (something else))... Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think of the formula in terms of scaling.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*^(2/3)) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the proportionality. Since K is proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)) )

But in our case, M_p and M_* are the same for both planets. So, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

But wait, the problem says that Planet #1 has a shift K1 of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has K2 of 7 milliangstroms. So, K2/K1 = 7/5=1.4.

So, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K2/K1 = [ (P1/P2) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let's think again. Because K is proportional to (1/(P^(1/3)) ), so K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K³.

Wait, no. Let me think of it as K = (constant) / P^(1/3). So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

So, K2/K1 = (C / P2^(1/3)) / (C / P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1 / P2) )^(1/3).

So, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this:

(P1/P2) = (K2/K1)³

So, the ratio of periods P1/P2 = (7/5)^3 = (1.4)^3 ≈ 2.744.

Wait, but the question is asking "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1?" So, that is P2 / P1.

If P1/P2 = (7/5)^3, then P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Calculating that: 5/7 is approximately 0.714. So, (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, that's approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the ratios.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so a larger K implies a smaller P.

So, if K2 is larger than K1 (7 >5), then P2 must be smaller than P1.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the star is moving faster (higher K), that suggests a more massive planet or a shorter period. Oh wait, but in our case, the planets have the same mass. So, a higher K must mean a shorter period. So, if K2 is larger, Planet #2 has a shorter period than Planet #1.

So, the question asks P2 / P1.

Given that, so the ratio is (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364. So, the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents.

Let me rederive the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ) ]^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(1) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but the key point is that when all else is equal (same M_p and M_*), K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K³.

Therefore, the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait no, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/(K^3).

Wait, let me think in terms of ratios. Let's say K2 = (7/5) K1.

So, P2 = (K1 / K2 )^3 * P1

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so higher K means smaller P.

So,

P2 = (K1 / K2 )^3 * P1.

Which is (5/7)^3 * P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Which is approximately 0.36, option A.

So, the answer should be A) ~0.36.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets have similar masses and their host stars have the same mass as the Sun. The Radial Velocity (RV) method measures the semi-amplitude \( K \), which is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The relationship between \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Since \( K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4 \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \left(0.714\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1.

Answer: A
