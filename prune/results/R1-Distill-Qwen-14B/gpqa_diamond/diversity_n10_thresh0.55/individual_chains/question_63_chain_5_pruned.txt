Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I guess that's J=0 or maybe J=1, not sure). Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that would be the ground state of both rotation and vibration.

The molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state with the lowest energy. I guess that means the photon provides just enough energy to increase either the vibrational or rotational state by the smallest possible amount.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the photon's energy is related to its momentum via E = pc, since for photons, E=hf and p=E/c. So the momentum p is E/c.

So the key is to find the energy difference between the initial and final states and then find the photon's momentum that corresponds to that energy.

The initial state is the fundamental state, so I think that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the first excited state either in rotation or vibration. I need to figure out what's the smallest possible energy change.

Wait, I remember that the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For rotation, the energy levels are given
