Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, let's think. I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in energy measurement. Oh right, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The question gives two energy levels, E1 and E2, with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, no, the problem says their lifetimes are 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec. But the question is about the energy difference between them to be resolved. So, I guess each state has a certain lifetime, and the energy difference is what we're trying to find.

Wait, the uncertainty in time for each state is related to their lifetime. So for each state, Δt is about the lifetime. But since we're looking at the energy difference between two states, maybe we should consider the lifetime of the excited state when it decays. Or perhaps the time it takes for the energy levels to be measured.

Wait, when you have two states, the energy difference must be such that the uncertainty in energy (which comes from the lifetime) is less than the energy difference. Otherwise, you can't distinguish between them. So the condition is ΔE > ħ/(2Δt_max), where Δt_max is the maximum time uncertainty. Or wait, the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, so for the energies to be distinguishable, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which
