Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to determine the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably figure out what this Lagrangian implies about the interactions. The Lagrangian term given is for the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. Let's break it down.

The term looks like a Yukawa coupling. The general form of a Yukawa interaction is something like g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field and X is a scalar boson. In this case, the term is written as λ f f-bar X, perhaps? Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as -λ f f bar (y) multiplied by (v + X(y)) and ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the structure is that the fermion fields are interacting with the X field. The term is -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't quite make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the correct term is something like λ ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, maybe the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe it's more like ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), which would make sense because X is a scalar, so the interaction is between X and the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, but the notation is a bit unclear. Let's try to parse it correctly. The term is written as -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the fields. The term is -λ f (y) f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is -λ ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y), which would be a Yukawa coupling, since the scalar X is coupling to the fermion ψ_f.

Wait, wait, perhaps the L is written as L(y) = -λ f (y) ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). But that doesn't quite make sense because ψ_f (y) is a spinor, and you can't multiply two spinors directly in that way. Oh wait, perhaps it's more like f (y) is a field, maybe a Dirac field, and the term is ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y), but that would require ψ_f to be a Majorana field, which fermions aren't typically.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the Lagrangian term is -λ f (y) ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the term is (λ/√2) ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y), which would be a Yukawa interaction term where X couples to fermions of type ψ_f.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ_f and their antiparticles. So the interaction is such that X can couple to fermions, allowing it to decay into two fermions.

So the first thing I should figure out is which fermions ψ_f are allowed. Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, the fermions that can be produced must each have a mass less than 3 GeV, because in pair production, each fermion must have mass less than half of the parent particle's mass.

Wait no, actually, the rest mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Because when a particle decays into two particles, each must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So the maximum mass each can have is 3 GeV because 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So the fermions that X can decay into are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let me think:

- Up quark (u): around 2 MeV, negligible compared to 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5-5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV.

Similarly for leptons:

- Electron (e): 0.5 MeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos are much lighter, but since they are neutral, maybe not relevant here unless the interaction allows for neutrinos, but in this case, the interaction is with ψ_f, which I think refers to charged fermions.

So the fermions that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV are: u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ. Wait, wait, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV.

But wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so it's above 3 GeV, so X cannot decay into b quarks. So the possible fermions that X can decay into are u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ, and their corresponding antiparticles.

But let's look at the options. The options are A to D, each giving a list of possible decay channels.

Looking at option A: X can decay into b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the b quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is heavier than 3 GeV. So X's mass is 6 GeV. Each b quark would require 4.5 GeV, but two would require 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass. So that's impossible. So option A includes b quarks, which would be too heavy. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, the c quark is about 1.3 GeV. 1.3 * 2 = 2.6 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV, so that's allowed. So decay into c c-bar is possible. Similarly, tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2 * 1.78 = ~3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So possible. Muon is ~105 MeV, so 2 * 0.105 GeV = 0.21 GeV, which is fine. e is even lighter.

Wait, but let me double-check the c quark mass. The current mass of the charm quark is about 1.27 to 1.5 GeV. So 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So that's allowed.

So option B includes c, which is allowed. But wait, in the given Lagrangian, does X couple to all these fermions?

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the term. Maybe the fermions ψ_f are the ones that X couples to. So the fermions that X can decay into depend on which ψ_f fields are present in the theory.

Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So ψ_f could be any fermion, but perhaps in our case, the coupling is to all the fermions, but the ones that are kinematically allowed are the ones with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, but the Lagrangian may not necessarily couple X to all possible fermions. The given interaction could be a specific coupling to certain fermions.

Hmm, the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so perhaps X can decay into the fermions that ψ_f represents. So for each ψ_f, the X couples to that fermion.

Wait, but the notation is a bit unclear. Let me think again: the term is -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y).

Wait, perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term where X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the fermion ψ_f must have a mass that is less than or equal to half of X's mass, which is 3 GeV.

So, the question is, which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

- u, d, s, c (quarks), and e, μ, τ (leptons).

Because their masses are all under 3 GeV.

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is too heavy. So A is out.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's correct for the allowed fermions. So B is a candidate.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy. So C is out.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy. So D is out.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but why does the interaction Lagrangian allow for all these fermions? The Lagrangian term is written as -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps f and ψ_f are the same, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe f is a different notation for the fermion.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is such that X can decay into any fermion that has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. So if the fermions are lighter, they can be produced.

Wait, but in reality, the couplings depend on the particle content of the model. But the problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So perhaps in this model, X couples to all the fermions that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Thus, the allowed decays are into pairs of u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Looking back at the options:

Option B lists all these except for the t, which isn't present. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'fermions' in general, but perhaps in the Standard Model, the bosons can only couple to charged fermions, or maybe to both charged and neutral, depending on the type of boson. But since X is a boson, perhaps it's a scalar, so it can only couple to fermions in certain ways. But I think in the Standard Model, Yukawa couplings are between scalars and fermions, regardless of charge, but perhaps in this case, the X is a neutral boson, so it can only decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the possible decay channels are all the allowed fermion pairs whose combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So, the correct answer should include all possible fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

So, the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. Each of these can form a pair (e.g., e+ e-, mu+ mu-, etc.). So, the decay options would include all pairs of these.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes all of these except the b, which is excluded because it's too heavy.

Wait, but in the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes, that's all the possible fermions under 3 GeV.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is:

X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, given its mass.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The Lagrangian implies that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decays are governed by the requirement that the combined mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). Specifically, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to half of \( X \)'s mass, i.e., \( \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total energy of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - \( u, d, s \): Quarks with masses much smaller than 3 GeV.
   - \( c \): Charm quark with mass \( \sim 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - \( b \): Bottom quark with mass \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds the 3 GeV limit.
   - \( e, \mu, \tau \): Leptons with masses \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV}, 105.7 \, \text{MeV}, 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), all of which satisfy the constraint.

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion pairs:
   - \( c \bar{c} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
   - \( e^+ e^- \)

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden due to the bottom quark's mass exceeding 3 GeV. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Lists all allowed decays (\( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \)) and excludes \( b \bar{b} \). **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden due to the top quark's extremely high mass. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
