Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of this boson X. Let's see what I can remember from my particle physics class. The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, so this looks like a Yukawa coupling type interaction. The fermion ψ_f is interacting with the boson X. The term suggests that the fermions f (like electrons, quarks, etc.) can emit or absorb the X boson.

Now, the decays of X would be into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term is like ψ X ψ, so X can decay into two fermions. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any fermion pair that has a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV is allowed. But wait, each fermion has its own mass. For example, a top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks because 6 GeV is much less than 173 GeV. Similarly, other heavy fermions like the bottom quark (about 4.7 GeV) or tau lepton (1.78 GeV) would need to be considered.

Wait, but for fermions, like quarks,
