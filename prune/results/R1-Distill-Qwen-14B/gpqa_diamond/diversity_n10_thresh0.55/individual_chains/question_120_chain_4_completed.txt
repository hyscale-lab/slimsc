Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. The closer the star, the larger its parallax. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance; so plx = 1/distance. Or wait, I think it's actually distance = 1/plx (in parsecs, I guess). Right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So uniform in what sense? I think uniform distribution in space would mean that the number density of stars is constant in space. But wait, more accurately, uniform distribution in the universe, but here we're talking about their apparent distribution in the sky, which relates to their distances.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, per unit change in parallax, how many stars do we have?

Let me think about the volume of space that a given parallax range would cover. The parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So let's say we have two parallax values, plx1 and plx2, where plx2 > plx1. That means the stars at plx2 are closer because larger parallax means closer distance. Wait no, wait: no, wait, wait. Parallax is in arcseconds. The formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So higher parallax means closer. So if plx increases, the distance decreases.

Wait, no, no, wait. Let me clarify: the parallax angle (pl) is given by pl = 1 / distance (d), where d is in parsecs. So for a star at distance d, plx = 1/d. So if d increases, plx decreases. So a star twice as far has half the parallax.

Now, the number of stars in a given range of parallax would depend on the volume of space between those parallaxes. Because if stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a volume is proportional to the volume.

So let's model this. Suppose we have a small change in parallax, delta_p. We need to find the number of stars per unit delta_p, so how the number changes with plx.

Wait, the question is asking about the number per unit range of plx. So it's the number of stars in each small delta_p interval.

So let's think about the volume between parallax plx and plx + delta_p. But wait, no, because parallax increases as distance decreases. So higher plx is closer.

Wait, actually, when the parallax increases, the distance decreases. So if you have a range of plx from plx to plx + delta_p, that corresponds to stars from distance d to d - delta_d, where delta_d is the change in distance corresponding to delta_p.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell between distances d and d + delta_d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell multiplied by the thickness (delta_d), assuming uniform density.

So the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r^2, so for a thin shell, the volume is approximately 4 pi d^2 delta_d. So the number of stars in this shell is N = n * 4 pi d^2 delta_d, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But wait, in the question, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think implies that the number density is constant. So n is a constant.

Now, how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So delta_d would be the change in d when plx changes by delta_p. Let's compute delta_d in terms of delta_p.

d = 1/plx, so delta_d = d (delta_plx / plx^2 ). Wait, no: take the derivative. Let me compute delta_d as delta_p approaches zero. So, delta_d ≈ (dd/dplx) delta_p.

dd/dplx is derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx: which is -1/(plx)^2. So delta_d ≈ (-1/(plx^2)) delta_p. But since delta_p is positive when plx increases (we're moving to a closer shell), delta_d is negative, meaning d decreases. But when we're considering the shell from d to d + delta_d, if delta_d is negative, that would be d to d - |delta_d|. So to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of plx.

Alternatively, we can express the volume in terms of plx.

Wait, let me think again about the volume element in terms of parallax. Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number per unit volume is constant. So for a given parallax range (say, plx to plx + dplx), what is the corresponding volume in terms of distance?

Wait, parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if we have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance is from d = 1/plx to d - delta_d, since delta_d = -1/(plx^2) dplx.

Wait, perhaps I should model the volume in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the number of stars as a function of plx.

The number of stars at a given distance d is proportional to the surface area at that distance. Wait, surface area is 4 pi d^2. So the number of stars between d and d+delta_d would be n * 4 pi d^2 delta_d.

But since plx = 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx, so delta_d = - (d^2) delta_p. Because delta_p = delta (1/d) = - (1/d^2) delta_d. So delta_d = -d^2 delta_p = -(1/(plx)^2) delta_p.

Now, substituting d = 1/plx into the number of stars:

N = n *4 pi (1/plx)^2 * |delta_d|.

Since delta_d is negative when plx increases, we take the absolute value for the number of stars. So:

N = n *4 pi (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2) delta_p )

Wait, no, because delta_d is -(1/(plx^2)) delta_p. So |delta_d| is (1/(plx^2)) delta_p.

So substituting, N = n *4 pi (1/plx^2) * (1/(plx^2) delta_p )

Which simplifies to N = 4 pi n (1/plx^4) delta_p.

So the number of stars per unit delta_p (i.e., the density in plx space) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. That seems a bit off. Because if the number of stars per unit parallax is going as 1/plx^4, that would mean that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number per unit delta_p drops off quickly.

Let me think about this again. When plx is small (d is large), the number of stars per unit plx would be lower because each unit plx corresponds to a much larger volume. Wait, no, actually, wait. For small plx (large d), each unit change in plx (delta_p) corresponds to a large change in d. But the volume depends on d^2 delta_d. So perhaps I messed up the substitution.

Wait, let's do it more carefully.

Number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+delta_d is N = n *4 pi d^2 delta_d.

We can express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So delta_d = d * delta_p / (plx)^2. Wait, no, because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → delta_d = -1/(plx)^2 delta_p.

So delta_d is negative when plx increases, but we take the absolute value for the volume.

So N = n *4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2) delta_p )

= 4 pi n (1/plx^4) delta_p.

So the number of stars per unit delta_p (i.e., the number per unit parallax interval) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the same as option A: ~1/plx^4.

Hmm, but I thought the number of stars per unit distance would decrease with distance squared (since it's proportional to d^2). But when we express it in terms of parallax, it's 1/plx^4.

Wait, another way to think: the number of stars per unit volume is constant. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness delta_d is 4 pi d^2 delta_d. So number of stars is proportional to d^2 delta_d.

But since delta_d is related to delta_p (delta_p = -delta_d / d^2 ), we can substitute:

number of stars per unit delta_p is proportional to d^2 * |delta_d| / |delta_p|.

Wait, perhaps it's better to do it in terms of differential elements.

Let me consider differentials. The number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * volume between d and d+delta_d.

Volume between d and d+delta_d is 4 pi d^2 delta_d.

But delta_d = - (delta_p) * d^2.

So N = n *4 pi d^2 * ( -d^2 delta_p )

But since delta_p is positive when plx increases, delta_d is negative. So the actual volume is 4 pi d^2 * |delta_d| =4 pi d^2 * d^2 delta_p.

Wait, that would be 4 pi d^4 delta_p.

But wait, that can't be right because as delta_p increases, the volume would increase, but in reality, higher delta_p (smaller d) corresponds to a larger change in d for a given delta_p. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me approach it with calculus. The number density is n stars per cubic parsec.

The volume between d and d + delta_d is 4 pi d^2 delta_d.

In terms of plx, since plx = 1/d, we can write d = 1/plx → delta_d = - (delta_p) / plx^2.

So the volume becomes 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (delta_p / plx^2 ) = 4 pi (1/plx^4) delta_p.

So N = n * 4 pi (1/plx^4) delta_p.

Which means that the number of stars per unit delta_p (i.e., the density in plx space) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the number per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is 4 pi n / plx^4.

Wait, but in the question, it's the number per unit range of parallax. So for a given plx, how does the number of stars in a small range around plx change with plx?

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option would be A, which is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number per unit of parallax is the number of stars per parsec of parallax. So for a given plx, the number of stars per delta_p is N = n * 4 pi d^2 * (delta_d).

But delta_d = delta_p * d^2. Because delta_d = (d + delta_d) - d = delta_d, but from plx's perspective, delta_p = - delta_d / d^2 → delta_d = - delta_p d^2.

So the absolute change in d is |delta_d| = delta_p d^2.

So substituting into N: n *4 pi d^2 * (delta_p d^2 ) → n *4 pi d^4 delta_p.

But since d = 1/plx, d^4 = (1/plx)^4.

So N = n *4 pi (1/plx^4) delta_p.

Which again gives N proportional to 1/plx^4.

So that suggests that the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the volume of space corresponding to a given parallax range.

1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**:  
   Parallax is inversely proportional to distance:  
   \[
   \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}, \quad \text{where } d \text{ is the distance in parsecs}.
   \]  
   As plx increases, the distance \(d\) decreases, and vice versa.

2. **Volume of a Thin Shell**:  
   For a thin shell of stars at distance \(d\) with thickness \(\delta_d\), the volume is approximately:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4 \pi d^2 \delta_d.
   \]  
   The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, assuming a constant number density \(n\):  
   \[
   N = n \cdot 4 \pi d^2 \delta_d.
   \]

3. **Relating \(\delta_d\) to \(\delta_{\text{plx}}\)**:  
   Differentiating \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), we find:  
   \[
   \delta_d = -\frac{\delta_{\text{plx}}}{\text{plx}^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the absolute value, \(\delta_d = \frac{\delta_{\text{plx}}}{\text{plx}^2}\).

4. **Substituting into \(N\)**:  
   Substituting \(\delta_d = \frac{\delta_{\text{plx}}}{\text{plx}^2}\) and \(d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}}\) into the expression for \(N\), we get:  
   \[
   N = n \cdot 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\delta_{\text{plx}}}{\text{plx}^2}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   N = n \cdot 4 \pi \cdot \frac{\delta_{\text{plx}}}{\text{plx}^4}.
   \]  
   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(\delta_{\text{plx}}\)) is proportional to \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}\), meaning it drops off rapidly with increasing parallax. This corresponds to option **A**.
