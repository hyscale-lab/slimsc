Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance in this context must refer to a particle that's unstable and decays quickly. The question is about finding the mean decay distance, which I think has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays.

The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the formulas here. I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean distance should be speed multiplied by lifetime.

But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, which I need to convert into units compatible with ħ. Because ħ has units of GeV·seconds or something like that?

Wait, let's think about units. I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So when I divide that by Γ (which is in GeV if I convert properly), I'll get the lifetime in seconds.

Wait, no, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s
