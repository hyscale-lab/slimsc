Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking which of the given physical theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make these infinities manageable so that you can cancel them out with renormalization. But wait, some theories might not need regularization because they inherently don't have these divergences, or perhaps they're already finite.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories are supposed to be finite because they're background-independent and have a different way of handling interactions. Or wait, maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Do string theories require regularization? I recall that in string theory, the concept of divergences is handled differently, perhaps through the structure of the string's modes of vibration. So maybe they don't require the same kind of regularization as, say, quantum electrodynamics or chromodynamics.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills theories. I know that QCD does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, especially at high energies (like in the UV), you get divergences. These need to be regularized before renormalization can happen. So QCD definitely needs regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, and it's a well-understood quantum field theory. QED does require regularization because of the divergent loop integrals. For example, electron self-energy diagrams lead to infinities. These are handled through renormalization, which relies on the regularization process. So QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical ED is the Maxwell's equations and their classical treatments. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve quantum effects like divergent loop integrals. So regularization, which is a quantum field theory technique, isn't needed here. But wait, the question is about high energies. Does classical ED have any issues at high energies that would require regularization? I don't think so. Classical theories don't have the same divergences as their quantum counterparts. So classical ED doesn't need regularization.

Wait a minute. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So the correct answer must be a theory that doesn't have these divergences in its calculations. If a theory is free of divergences, regularization isn't necessary.

So Superstring Theory (A) and Classical ED (D) are the options that might be candidates.

But wait, I thought that in some cases, even string theories might require some form of regularization, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

In QFT, regularization is a way to make sense of divergent integrals. String theory, on the other hand, is supposed to be a background-independent theory that doesn't have the same kind of divergences because it's a theory of extended objects
