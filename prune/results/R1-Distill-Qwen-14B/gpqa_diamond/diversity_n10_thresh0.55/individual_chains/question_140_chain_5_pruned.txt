Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. Let's see what I can gather from the description.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is made up of elements with at least one heavy isotope. That might mean X has a stable isotope with a higher mass number.

Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, protons = neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Maybe hydrogen? But hydrogen's molecule is H2, which has 1 proton each, and 0 neutrons each. So that doesn't fit. Oh wait, maybe something like NH3? No, because in ammonia, each N has 7 protons, each H has 1. But that's a molecule, not sure. Or maybe another gas.

Wait, wait, another possibility: if W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about the elements. For a molecule, like H2O. No, that's 2 H (1p each) and 1 O (8p). So 2 protons, 8 in O. Not equal. Or maybe CO2? 2 O and C. Not sure.

Wait, maybe W
