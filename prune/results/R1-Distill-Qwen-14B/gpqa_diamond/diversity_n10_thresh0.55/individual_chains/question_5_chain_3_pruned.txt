Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a muon, but wait, I think the particle type might not matter here since the problem is more about the operator and eigenvectors. So the operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write down each component matrix.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that matrix is like σ_x, the Pauli X matrix.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix times ħ/2.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction components. Wait, no, actually, since the direction is arbitrary, we need to express the operator in terms of the direction vector n. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the form (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Alternatively, we can parameterize it using an angle θ, where n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, because in the x-z plane, the angle would be measured from the x-axis. So the direction vector n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ).

So the operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n_y is zero, that term drops out. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P = (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (sinθ)(ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute this matrix:

First term (from P_x): (ħ/2) [ [0, cosθ], [cosθ, 0] ]

Wait no, wait: the first term when multiplied by cosθ:

Wait, P_x is (ħ/2) [[0 1],[1 0]], so multiplying by cosθ would give (ħ/2 cosθ) times each element. So:

P_x * cosθ = (ħ/2 cosθ) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]], multiplied by sinθ:

= (ħ/2 sinθ) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So adding these together:

P = (ħ/2)[ cosθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + sinθ * [ [1,0], [0,-1] ] ]

Let me compute each element:
