Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question says we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. And we need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means a more stable complex. So in this case, the complex is pretty stable because 5e10 is a big number.

The problem says the solution is stoichiometric. I think that means the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. But wait, when the complex dissociates, each formula unit releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA⁴- ion. So if the complex is dissociating, the concentration of Ca²+ would be equal to the concentration of EDTA⁴-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in solution. So if the complex dissociates, what's the [Ca²+]?

I remember that for a complex like CaEDTA, the dissociation can be represented as CaEDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴-. And the formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[CaEDTA].

Wait,
