Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. So, I remember that luminosity has to do with the energy a star emits. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, same factor for both radius and mass. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm, I think for main-sequence stars, mass is a big factor in determining luminosity. Oh right, more massive stars are more luminous. But I'm not sure about the exact relation. Is it linear, or is it a power law?

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's Law here. Wien's Law says lambda_max * T = constant, where T is the temperature. Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but if their temperatures are the same, what about their luminosities? Luminosity depends on radius squared times temperature to the fourth power, right? Because L = 4πR²σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So if R is larger and T is the same, the luminosity should be higher for Star 1. But wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star
