Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

So, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms between energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, so when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower. So the ratio when no spots (6000 K) is higher than when there are spots (5500 K). So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2) when no spots divided by (n1/n2) when there are spots? Or wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2. So when the temperature is lower, how does the ratio change?

Wait, the formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So if ΔE is positive (since E2 > E1), and T decreases, then the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller. So n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2, which is the inverse, would increase.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio (n1/n2) goes down? Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the observed ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So, let's think about the ratio when spots are present (T=5500 K) vs. when they're not (T=6000 K).

In the no-spot case: T1 =6000 K, ratio R1= n1/n2 = 1/( (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )) )

In the spot case (T2=5500 K): R2= 1/( (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )) )

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2.

Let me compute R1/R2.

R1/R2 = [1/(g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)))] / [1/(g2/g1 exp( -ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Simplify. The (g2/g1) terms cancel, and the exponents become:

exp( Δ
