Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question gives me three different reactions labeled A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions, and I have to determine the major products from each. Then, I need to match these products with the options provided (A, B, C, D) which list possible products for each reaction.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A:

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so I'm thinking this is deprotonating something to form an enolate, which would then attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Dimethyl malonate is a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. Since malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate, the base (NaOEt) would deprotonate it at the alpha position, creating a nucleophilic enolate ion. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OEt, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, no, the formula is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so it would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OEt? No, wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate should be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but with the double bond between the first and second carbons, which are the alpha and beta positions. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but wait no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon, which would be the same as the carbonyl carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? Because the numbering starts from the COOEt group. So the carbonyl is at position 1, then CH2 at position 2, and the double bond between 2 and 3 with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So structure would be: OEtO-C-C(=O)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)=CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but that would make the double bond between the first and second carbons, with the p-tolyl on the third. Hmm, maybe I should visualize it as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the correct structure is probably CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but I think the correct structure is more accurately represented as CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOEt. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean that the substituent is on the third carbon. But wait, that would be beyond the carbonyl. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps
