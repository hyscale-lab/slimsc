Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the reactions given are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

And the options for A and B are given as combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, that structure... So butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the first. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, what happens?

Wait, I remember that ketones can
