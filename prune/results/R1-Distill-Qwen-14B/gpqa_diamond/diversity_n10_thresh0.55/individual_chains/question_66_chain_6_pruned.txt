Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are constructed with certain symmetries in mind because the Standard Model itself respects those symmetries.

Let's break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So any operator added in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory would not be consistent with our understanding of relativity. So operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry. Since SMEFT is built on top of the Standard Model, which respects Poincare symmetry, I think the SMEFT operators must also respect it. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because SMEFT is an effective theory, does it require Poincare invariance for all operators?

Wait, the Standard Model's Lagrangian is Poincare invariant, so any operator added must also be invariant under Poincare. So yes, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So option 2 is correct.

3. CP symmetry: Wait, does the SMEFT require operators to
