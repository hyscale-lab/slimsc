Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's interesting because it's a complex function, which makes sense because wave functions can be complex. But when we measure the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Oh, right, because outside that range, the wave function should be zero, I suppose.

So the question is asking for the value of 'a'. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers. I think I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain normalization conditions. Like, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. That's the normalization condition for wave functions.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That seems like a complex function. So the absolute square would be the square of the magnitude. Let me write that down. The wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. So ψ* (the complex conjugate) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then the absolute square is ψ*ψ, which would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply it out, the cross terms (the imaginary parts) would involve i and -i, so they'd cancel out when multiplied, leaving the sum of the squares.

So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. But wait, that's only where the wave function is non-zero. Oh, wait, but the wave function is given as that expression only where it can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. Otherwise, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is zero outside [1,3], and inside it's (a/sqrt(... )) -0.5i.

But wait, the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3 because the particles aren't found there. So that part is taken care of.

But for normalization, the integral from 1 to
