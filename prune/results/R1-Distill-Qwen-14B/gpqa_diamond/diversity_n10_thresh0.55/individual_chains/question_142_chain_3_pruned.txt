Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state).

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think this is a specific case. Let me write it out in matrix form because that might help. The |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is the matrix with 1 in the bottom-right corner. So adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Then multiplying by 1/2 would make each diagonal element 1/2. So the matrix ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Right, that's the density matrix. Now, the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices are positioned geometrically. I remember that the space of qubit density matrices is a subset of 3x3 matrices (or 2x2 for qubits), and they form a convex set. The geometry often involves the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent pure states of a qubit. Pure states are represented as points on the surface of the sphere. But what about mixed states? I think the density matrix for a mixed state lies inside the Bloch sphere. The position is given by a vector r = (x, y, z), where z is the expectation value of the Pauli Z operator, and the other components relate to the other Pauli matrices.

In the case of a completely mixed state, like this one, the density matrix is (I + 0)/2, I think. Wait, no, wait: the general form for a density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So for ρ to be a density matrix, the vector r must have a magnitude ≤ 1, because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and have trace 1.

Given our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute it in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So the given ρ is (I)/2. So comparing that to the general form (I + r·σ)/2, this implies that r·σ must be zero. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, because if I set (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2, then r·σ must be zero
