Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Right, it's a special case where all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. So in this problem, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distanceâ€”so that's the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure is the same as the lattice parameter a if it's a simple cubic structure. But rhombohedral has a more complicated structure. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter is a, but the unit cell has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron.

The interplanar distance, d, for a given plane (hkl) can be found using the formula from the Bragg's law context. The formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) + ... wait, no, that might not be right. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles alpha, beta, gamma between the edges is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos alpha - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos gamma ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees here. So the formula simplifies.
