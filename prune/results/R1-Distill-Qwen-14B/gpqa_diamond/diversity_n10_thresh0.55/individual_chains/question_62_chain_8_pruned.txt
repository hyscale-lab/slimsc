Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of synthesis reactions. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde starting from ethynylcyclohexane. The options give different sequences of reagents, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should probably draw the structures to get a clear picture. Starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is like a triple bond attached to another carbon. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH maybe? Or maybe the triple bond is directly on the ring. Wait, ethynyl is C≡C- attached. So ethynylcyclohexane would have a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CH2 group where one of the carbons is triple bonded. Wait no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexyl-ethynyl, meaning the triple bond is between two carbons attached to the ring. Hmm, maybe it's cyclohexane with a substituent that's a propargyl group. Wait, ethynyl is a terminal alkyne, so ethynylcyclohexane would have the structure where the cyclohexane is connected to a -CH2-C≡CH group? Or is it directly attached to the ring? Let me think again. The IUPAC name for ethynylcyclohexane would be 1-cyclohexylethylene? No, I think it's cyclohexane with a substituent that's an ethynyl group. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, maybe it's cyclohexane with a propargyl substituent. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look up ethynylcyclohexane structure. Oh wait, in this scenario, I can't look it up, so I'll have to proceed.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclo
