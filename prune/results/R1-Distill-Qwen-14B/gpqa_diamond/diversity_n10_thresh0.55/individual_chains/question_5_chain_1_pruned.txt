Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to them. The eigenvalue is that scalar factor. So, the problem says the operator is P, and we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, wait. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, I think. But maybe I should clarify that. So the unit vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ must be zero or 180 degrees, because y-component is zero. Oh wait, no, the x-z plane includes all angles where y is zero, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because φ is the angle around the z-axis, so if it's in x-z, φ is 0. So the direction is along (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Wait, but the operator is given as components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator P is a vector operator, and the total operator is P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But since the direction is along n, the operator in question is P·n. So the operator for the eigenvalue equation is P·n, and we're looking for its eigenvectors.

But wait, the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n...". Oh wait, no, maybe the operator is the spin operator for the muon, which is similar to the Pauli matrices. Because the given components P_x, P_y, P_z look familiar as the spin matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let's look at the components. P_x is given as (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second (1,0). Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which has [0, -i; i, 0], and P_z is (ħ/2) times Pauli Z, which is [1,0; 0,-1].

So the spin operator for a spin-1/
