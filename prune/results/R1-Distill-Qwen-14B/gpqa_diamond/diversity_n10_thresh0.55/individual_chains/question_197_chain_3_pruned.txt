Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X. The options are four different organic compounds, so I need to determine which one is the correct product.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of O-H or N-H groups, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, looking more closely, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak that could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, maybe Compound X is a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several peaks. Let's go through them one by one.

The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 1H. That's quite a high chemical shift. Aromatic protons are usually around 7 ppm, so this could be an O-H proton, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton is typically around 10-12 ppm. But in the IR, we saw a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. So that fits. But wait, the IR also shows a peak at 3400-2500, which is a broad region, perhaps from an -OH group. Alternatively, the broad peak could be an alcohol, but a carboxylic acid would have a higher shift in NMR.

Wait, let me think again. Another possibility is that the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and they are deshielded. But the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. However, aldehyde IR peaks are around 2820 and 2720 (stretching) and the carbonyl around
