Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't exist for very long. The question is about the mean decay distance of this meson.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so the answer is about calculating the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Hmm, I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (v), so distance = cτv. But wait, maybe there's another way to approach it using the uncertainty principle or something related to the particle's energy.

Wait, I think the proper way to calculate the mean decay length involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ. I remember that the uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time. Or wait, the relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Right, because Γ is the decay width, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I'm not entirely certain about the exact factor.

Wait, more accurately, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think Γ is actually the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that's right. So first, I need to compute the lifetime using this formula.

But wait, wait! The decay width Γ is given in MeV, which is a unit of energy. So I can't directly plug that into the formula because ħ has units of energy multiplied by time, but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me think about unit conversions.

Alternatively, maybe the mean decay length can be found using another approach. Oh, right! The mean decay length (L) can be calculated using the formula:

L = (c * τ) * (v)

But wait, I think the formula is L = c * τ * v. So I need c, the speed of light
