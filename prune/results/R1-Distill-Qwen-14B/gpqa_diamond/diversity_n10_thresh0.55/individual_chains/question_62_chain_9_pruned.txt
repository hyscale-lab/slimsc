Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see what the target molecule is.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down. So, it looks like the molecule has a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, which is further connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane. Also, there's a carbonyl group somewhere because it's a carbaldehyde.

Wait, the structure is probably like this: the cyclohexane ring (let's call it ring A) has a substituent which is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring (ring B) and a hydroxyl group. And on ring A, there's also an aldehyde group attached. So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexane with a CH2OH-cyclohexyl substituent and an aldehyde group. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a (cyclohexyl)hydroxymethyl substituent.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl means a triple bond attached. So, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is
