Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, which makes sense because the cavity is inside the conductor.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are different expressions for E, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is neutral (uncharged) and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor here was initially unchargedâ€”so maybe it's neutral. So when you add a charge inside the cavity, what happens?

I think that the conductor's electrons would redistribute. Since the charge inside is positive, the conductor's electrons would be attracted to the cavity, leaving the outer surface with a positive charge. Wait, no, wait: When a positive charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an equal and opposite charge, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the total charge added inside. But wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So when you add +q inside, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it out because the conductor was neutral. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so initially, it has no net charge. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's free electrons will move in response. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced charge of -q, because the positive charge attracts the negative charges. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q, because the total charge on the conductor must remain zero.
