Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to figure out what happens when we mix the acetic acid with water. Diluting it, right? So the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M, but when we add an equal volume of water, the concentration will decrease because the volume increases.

Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ and we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration is the same amount of moles in twice the volume. So the concentration becomes 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles, so concentration halves.

So now, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. The next part is the titration with NaOH. At 25% titration and at equivalence point, what's the pH?

Let's tackle the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So the moles of acetic acid initially are (volume in liters) times concentration.

Wait, the initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. The concentration is 0.025 M, so moles are 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence can be found by moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.

Moles of NaOH = 0.
