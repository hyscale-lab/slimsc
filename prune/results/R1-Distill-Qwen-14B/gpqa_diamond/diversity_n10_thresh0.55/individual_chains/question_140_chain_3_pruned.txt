Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of X.

Hmm. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let me break this down. Let's start by identifying what X and Y might be. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's something reactive. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a gas, perhaps it's something like H2O, CO2? Wait, let me think about the molecule. If W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's a molecule like H2O. Let's see: H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons are 2 + 8 =10, neutrons are 0 +8=8. Oh, that's not equal. Hmm. Maybe another molecule.

Wait, or maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, NH3 has 14 (N) and 3 H. Let's calculate: NH3 has 14 protons (from N) and 3 H (each 1 proton), total 17. Neutrons: N has 14 neutrons (since N is usually 14, but isotopes vary), but if it's the regular isotope, N is 14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The molecule's atoms each have their own protons and neutrons.

Wait, perhaps it's CO2. Let's compute. CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). So protons: 6 + 2*8 = 6+16=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*(8)= 6+16=22. Oh wait, that's equal. So W is
