Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for different complexes. 

Wait, stability constants, right. Those are the formation constants, β, which tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the β values given are for different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but I'm not sure which complex each β corresponds to. Oh, right, because each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions. So β1 would be for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc., up to β4 for Co(SCN)4.

But wait, the question asks specifically about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands, right? So that's the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex. So β2 is 40 for that complex. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me think: the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, [Co(SCN)_4]^4-. So each β corresponds
