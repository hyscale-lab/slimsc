Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. So R_star = R_sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, which have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness variations observed would be similar to those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The main point is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star? The options are A to D, and I need to find the right one.

Hmm. So I'm thinking about photometric variations. When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. Similarly, the star's spots would cause variations as they rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but in this case, the star is only showing one hemisphere with spots. So when it rotates, the spots would come into the line of sight and then go away, causing the brightness to dip each time. The brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

But how do I compare this to the planet transit case? Because in the planet case, the dip is due to the planet blocking starlight. For the spots, the dip is because the spots are cooler and emit less light than the rest of the star.

So the key here is to calculate the relative brightness change in both scenarios and set them equal, then solve for the planet radius.

Let me break it down.

First, the star's brightness when observed without spots would be its normal luminosity. But with spots, when a spot comes into view, the total brightness decreases because the spots are cooler and emit less.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The star's luminosity is determined by its radius and temperature. The spots are cooler, so each spot contributes less flux than the surrounding area. So the total flux when spots are visible is less than when they're not.

When we model the brightness variation, the dip is caused by the spots covering part of the star's surface. The depth of the dip depends on the area of the spots, their temperature, and the star's temperature.

But wait, the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and the spots are on one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20% which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, a hemisphere's area is (4πR²)/2 = 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But each spot is cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so spot temperature is 5000 K.

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. The flux from the spots is F_spot = σ(T_spot
