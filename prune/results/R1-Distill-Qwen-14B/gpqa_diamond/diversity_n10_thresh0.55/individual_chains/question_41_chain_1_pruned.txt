Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index, but I'm not entirely sure how the motion of the medium affects it.

So, the setup is a light beam moving through glass with refractive index n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. The observer is in the lab frame, and we're supposed to find the speed of light relative to this observer.

Wait, right, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, which is given as 1 here. But in glass, it's slower. The speed in glass is usually v = c/n. But wait, does the motion of the glass affect this speed as observed in the lab frame?

I think about frames of reference here. The glass is moving, so it's a different frame. But how does relative motion affect the speed of light? Oh wait, I remember from special relativity that the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames. That's Einstein's postulate. So no matter how fast the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame should still be c, right?

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is towards the observer. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving forward. How does that work?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing this with the case of a medium moving in a different direction. Let me think. If the medium is moving, but the light is moving in the same direction, perhaps the velocity addition formula applies here.
