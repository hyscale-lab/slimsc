Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by the Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). I'm not entirely sure what all the terms mean, but I think this is describing how the boson X interacts with fermions.

Wait, so bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term involves ψ_f, which I believe are fermion fields. So X must be able to couple to various fermions, and its decay products will depend on the masses of those fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f f̄ to be kinematically allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent must be at least twice the rest mass of the child particles for the decay to be possible.

I need to recall the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): approximately 1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): 0.000511 GeV
- Muon (μ): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are super light, but I don't think they're considered here since the problem doesn't mention them.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term given in the Lagrangian is probably something like Yukawa coupling. The term has ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So X is interacting with various fermions, but each coupling may depend on the type of fermion. However, the problem doesn't specify any particular couplings, so I think for the purpose of this question, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that's allowed by its mass.

So, for each fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X. m_X is 6 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Looking at the fermions:

- e: 0.0005 GeV. Way under.
- μ: 0.105 GeV.
- τ: 1.78 GeV.
- u: 0.0022 GeV.
- d: 0.0047 GeV.
- s: 0.095 GeV.
- c: 1.27 GeV.
- b: 4.5 GeV.
- t: 173 GeV, way too heavy.

So the fermions that can be decay products are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Let's see:

For quarks, the c quark is 1.27 GeV, so 2*c = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed. The b quark is 4.5 GeV; 2b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so not allowed. So X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV. If the fermion is a quark, but the quarks are confined. Oh, but when considering decays, we usually talk about the decay into particles that are leptons or quarks that can be detected as jets. But in terms of kinematics, it's only about whether the
