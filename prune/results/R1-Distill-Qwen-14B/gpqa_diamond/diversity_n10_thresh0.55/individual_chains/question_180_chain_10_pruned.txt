Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about that. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I guess I can calculate and see which one matches.

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is related to the charges and their positions. But wait, since all these particles are identical and have the same charge, I need to compute the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but since the 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m away from P, I think each of those 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. But I also have to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves, because they are all at the same point? No, wait, no. Wait, the problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at 2m away. So each of the 12 is 2m from P. But are the 12 charges also spaced apart from each
