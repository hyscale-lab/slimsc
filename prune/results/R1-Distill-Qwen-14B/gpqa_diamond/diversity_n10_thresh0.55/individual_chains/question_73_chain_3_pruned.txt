Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, relativistic addition applies here.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. Wait, the question is about their relative speed as observed from one astronaut's frame. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from relativity. Oh wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Let me think: if one object is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, the relative speed u' as seen from the second object's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, let me make sure. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from B's frame, what's A's speed? So u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So plugging in, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
