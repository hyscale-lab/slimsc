Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I need to check which of them are observable by both instruments based on their magnitudes.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. The key here is their limiting magnitudes. From the problem statement, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag less than 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16, so apparent V mag less than 16. So a star needs to have an apparent V mag ≤16 to be detected by HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, it's m <17. So to be observable by ESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude should be less than 17. For HIRES, it's less than 16.

But wait, the problem says that HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So if a star's apparent V is 16.5, that's fainter than 16, so it can't be observed by HIRES. But wait, the exact wording is important. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So for ESPRESSO, the V mag must be <17. For HIRES, V mag must be <16. So, a star needs to have V mag ≤16 to be detected by both, because if it's ≤16, it's within both's limits. But wait, no, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so any star that is detectable by HIRES (m <16) is also detectable by ESPRESSO. But also, some stars might be between 16 and 17, which ESPRESSO can detect but HIRES can't. So the question is about stars that can be detected by both, so stars that have apparent V mag ≤16.

But wait some stars might have their magnitudes affected by extinction (dust), which is given in some cases. The problem mentions that for Star3 and Star4, there's E(B
