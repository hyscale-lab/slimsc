Okay, so I have this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're bosons, and they mediate the strong force. But the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson X.

The given values are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from these.

Wait, I think mean decay distance is related to how far the particle travels before decaying. But how? Oh right, I remember something about lifetime and velocity. The mean decay length should be the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity, multiplied by the speed of light, I think.

But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given width? Oh yes, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I have to be careful with units here.

Wait, let me think about the steps. Step 1: Find the lifetime τ. Step 2: Find the velocity v of the meson. Then, multiply τ by v (times c, since v is a fraction of c) to get the mean decay length L.

But wait, do I have the correct formula? Let me think again. The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle's width and lifetime, the relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but in
