Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values. Hmm.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the initial solution. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, because 20+20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so CH3COOH. So when diluted, the concentration decreases.

So, first, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration would be 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. When you dilute a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate more. Or does it? Well, the degree of dissociation does increase, but maybe I can treat it with the same Ka as before. So perhaps for the initial diluted solution, I can calculate the pH.

But the problem isn't asking for the pH of the diluted solution; it's about the titration. So when we titrate this diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH.

So, the next part is about the titration. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me first think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. So, the moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001 mol (from before). We're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. So, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence would be (0.001 mol) / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the diluted solution is 40 cm³. So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume at equivalence would be 40 +10=50 cm³.

At equivalence point, the solution will contain the sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution will be basic. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-

So, to find the pH at equivalence, I can calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using Kb.

But first, let's get the concentration of acetate. The moles of acetate would be equal to the moles of acetic acid initially, since each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH. So, 0.001 mol. The total volume at equivalence is 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Yes, so [CH3COO-] = 0.02 M.

The Kb for acetate comes from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is ~5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-.

The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] ≈ 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), so x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH-] is ~3.29e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(3.29) is about 0.517, so 0.517 -6 =
