Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosities, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here? I remember that luminosity is related more to the star's radius and temperature. Oh yeah, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength, which according to Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So since their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, because if λ is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but that's interesting. So both stars have the same temperature. Now, their luminosities would then depend on their radii. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So substituting into the luminosity formula, L1 = 4π(R1)²σT⁴, L2 =4π(R2)²σT⁴. Since T is the same for both, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1²)/(R2²). Since R1 is 1.5 R2, that's (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2.

But wait, wait. There's more to the problem. The radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, radial velocity usually affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question is about the actual luminosity, not the observed. Because the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming black body radiation. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation, since luminosity is an intrinsic property. But wait, wait a second. Did they correct for Doppler shift when measuring the wavelengths?

Hmm, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same
