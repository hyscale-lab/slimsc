Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method so that the results are finite, and then you can remove the cutoff in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or because their structure avoids these divergences.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, trying to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. I remember that string theories, like superstring theory, typically don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do because they're background-independent and have a higher-dimensional framework. So maybe they don't need regularization? Or do they? Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think in string theory, when you calculate certain things, you might still get divergences, but maybe they are handled differently, perhaps through other mechanisms or because the theory is inherently free from some divergences. Or maybe it's because string theories have a finite number of divergent diagrams because of the way strings interact compared to point particles. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization as much as other QFTs.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD does require regularization because it's a non-abelian gauge theory with things like asymptotic freedom. Wait, but as far as I remember, QCD is a renormalizable theory, meaning it can handle divergences using renormalization. But does it require regularization? I think yes because without regularization, the perturbative calculations would lead to divergences that need to be absorbed via counterterms. Or maybe because QCD is non-perturbative at low energies, but I'm not sure if regularization is needed in its high-energy (UV) regime.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism
