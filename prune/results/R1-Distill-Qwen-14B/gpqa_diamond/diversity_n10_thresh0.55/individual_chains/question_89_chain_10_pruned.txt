Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I know adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a diamond but with a different arrangement of carbon atoms. 1,3-dibromo means there are two bromine atoms attached to carbons 1 and 3.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I think this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base, they usually undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But wait, in adamantane, the structure is such that the two bromines are not on adjacent carbons. Oh, wait, 1 and 3 positions—so they're not adjacent. Hmm, so maybe it's a different type of elimination.

Alternatively, could it be a double dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps since KOH is in excess, maybe it's a two-step elimination. When dihalides are treated with strong bases, sometimes they can form alkenes through the E2 mechanism. But if the dihalide isn't vicinal, perhaps it's a different outcome. Wait, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on opposite ends, but I'm not
