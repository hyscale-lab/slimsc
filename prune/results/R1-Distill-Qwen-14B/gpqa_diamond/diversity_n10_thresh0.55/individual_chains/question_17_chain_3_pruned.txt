Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and Ca is the metal ion. The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

So, I think this is a problem involving the dissociation of a complex ion. The complex dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions. The formation constant, K, is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. So, the formation reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

And the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, when the complex dissociates, it would go the other way. So, the dissociation would have an equilibrium constant equal to 1/K. Because the reverse reaction would have K' = 1/K.

So, the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

And the K_dissociation = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote this as [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M initially.

At equilibrium, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1:1 (1 Ca²+ per complex), then [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well. Because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get a mole of each ion.

So, the equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:

K_dissociation = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] /
