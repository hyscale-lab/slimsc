Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hittig reaction, which involves the formation of alkenes from aldehydes and ketones. Alternatively, it might be involved in some elimination reaction. Wait, but I think when an aldehyde or ketone reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's usually a substitution reaction, maybe forming an alkene. Because HI is a nucleophile and a good leaving group.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data.

Looking at the IR data: It has strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the big peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong one—likely a carbonyl group. 1720 suggests maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. Then, the peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are probably C=C stretching, indicating the presence of aromatic rings.

Now the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like a phenolic OH, but that would be more around 5 ppm, I think. Or maybe an alpha to carbonyl proton? Hmm, but the integration is 1H. Hmm, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton, but that's usually a broad peak. Wait, but in D2O, the acid would exchange, but maybe in CDCl3, it's just a broad signal. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. So, let's see the NMR.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde. Then the other peaks:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region, a doublet, so perhaps two equivalent protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. Similarly, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)—another doublet, also aromatic. This suggests a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents opposite each other. Like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, perhaps a CH adjacent to something else. Maybe a CH connected to an aromatic ring and another group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe a CH2 group, perhaps part of a chain attached to the benzene.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet, maybe a CH(CH3) group. Like a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3 group, probably part of an ethyl or longer chain. Like a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a benzene ring with substituents. The aromatic protons are a pair of doublets, which suggests substituents in the para positions.

So, the ring might have two substituents. Let's think about the substituents. The IR shows a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone or aldehyde or ester. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which might be an aldehyde proton. So maybe one substituent is an aldehyde group (CHO), and the other is a longer chain.

Wait, no. If the aldehyde is attached to the benzene ring, it would be a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's picture that.

So, the ring has two substituents. One
