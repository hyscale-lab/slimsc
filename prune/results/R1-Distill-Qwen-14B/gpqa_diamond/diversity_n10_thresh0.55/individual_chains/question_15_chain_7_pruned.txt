Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about transiting planets and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is detected via the radial velocity method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period means it's closer, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, the orbital period is related to the distance from the star.

Also, both have circular orbits, which simplifies things because eccentricity doesn't come into play. The host stars are interesting: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. That's a bit odd because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something, so it's evolved a bit but hasn't expanded yet, keeping the radius same as Planet_1's star.

Now, the question is about the probability of a transit. I think the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I recall for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter's effect. Wait, no, the probability (the geometric probability) is more about the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember is (R_p / a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the orbital distance. Wait, no, perhaps it's (R_p / R_star) squared times (1/(something involving a and the star's radius...)).

Wait, maybe the geometric probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / ( (a/(R_s))² )) )? Or maybe it's (R_p + R_s) / a? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The transit probability (geometric probability) is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the transit occurs. The geometric probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a/(R_s))) )? No, wait, I think the actual formula
