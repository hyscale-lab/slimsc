Hmm, okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the setup: Two stars, same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Using the RV method, they detect each planet. 

The key data: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. Specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, so I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The shift in wavelength (the spectral line) relates to the star's velocity towards or away from us. So the shift tells us about the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter due to the planet.

I remember that the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (2πG)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets' masses are similar to Neptune and the stars are Sun-like, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the mass of the Sun. So I can probably ignore M_p in this case.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (2π G) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^2 * (1 - e²) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) * sin i

Wait, no, perhaps another way
