Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, right! Magnitudes are a bit counterintuitive. A lower magnitude means brighter. So if ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17, that means any star with V mag ≤17 is detectable. Similarly, HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, stars with V mag ≤16 are okay.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the question says, can be detected with both. So a star has to be bright enough for both instruments. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (since ESPRESSO can see down to 17) and also ≤16 (because HIRES can only go down to 16). So the apparent V mag of the star needs to be ≤16 to be detectable by both. Because if it's, say, 16.5 mag, HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO could. But we need both. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-read the question. Oh, no, it says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V mag <17 (so up to
