Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

Okay, the question is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between the states.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio in question is N1/N2, right? Because the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower than when there are none.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (N1/N2) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher. I need to find the factor by which it changes, so probably (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

So, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, the ratio with spots is lower than without.

The energy levels are such that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet or perhaps visible range. The wavelength λ = 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the extreme ultraviolet. Wait, no. Wait 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is actually in the vacuum ultraviolet. Hmm
