Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. Oh, and the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So, I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Wait, transit probability depends on several factors. I remember the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit (edge-on). But since we're assuming they're already detected via RV, maybe their orbits are already aligned in a way that increases the chance of transiting? Or maybe not necessarily, but in this question, I think the key is the transit probability formula.

The probability of a transit is given by R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, I think the formula is P = (R_p / R_star) * (1 / (a / R_star)), but maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to transit) is actually (R_p / R_s)^
