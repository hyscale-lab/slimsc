Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. The question is about determining which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves different types of operations like rotations and reflections. C3h symmetry—wait, what does that mean again? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a threefold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a plane of symmetry that's horizontal.

The options given are four different molecules. Let me read them again:

A) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) Triisopropyl borate

D) Quinuclidine

I need to figure out which of these has the C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my nomenclature, so I'll try to break down each molecule.

Starting with option C: Triisopropyl borate. I think that's (i-Pr)3BO, right? So the structure is boron with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical, but with three identical substituents. So for symmetry, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. Wait, if all three groups are the same, the central atom (B) would allow for C3 symmetry. Let me think: if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the central axis (the boron), it should look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm. If the molecule is trigonal planar around boron, then a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. Wait, but boron is in the center, and each isopropyl is in a plane. Maybe the mirror plane would pass through the boron and one of the substituents. Wait, no, a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the axis of rotation. So if the molecule is trigonal planar, then the C3 axis is perpendicular to a plane. So the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) would require that the structure is symmetric when reflected across that plane.

Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno... has a different structure. Let me think about the other options.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine, I believe. It's a norbornane derivative with an amine group. Its structure is a bridged bicyclic compound. I think quinuclidine has a threefold axis of symmetry. Wait, no, I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. So it's a very symmetrical molecule. Wait, does it have a threefold rotation? Let me visualize it. Norbornane has a bridge structure, and quinuclidine has an amine in a specific position. I think its symmetry includes a C3 axis. Because if you rotate it 120 degrees, it might look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Wait, in norbornane, the structure is symmetric with respect to a plane that lies along the bridge. But I'm not certain about the mirror planes in quinuclidine. Maybe not, because the substituents (like the amine) might break some mirror planes. Or maybe the structure is such that it retains some symmetry.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That name is a bit complex. Trifuran suggests three furan rings. The benzo part would be a benzene ring fused to the furans. Wait, the numbering seems a bit tricky. Let me try to imagine it. The structure would have a benzene ring fused to three furan rings in a particular arrangement. Now, symmetry in such a structure—could it have a threefold axis? Alternatively, maybe it's more of a planar structure with multiple substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a tricyclic system with some symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran... So it's a trifuran system with three phenyl groups attached. The structure might have three substituents arranged symmetrically. If they're attached in such a way that each is 120 degrees apart, then a C3 axis would make sense. And if there's a mirror plane, that would contribute to the C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, I need to find which has both a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each molecule again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): So, three isopropyl groups attached to boron. The structure is trigonal planar around B. So, for each isopropyl group, they are in the same plane as each other, 120 degrees apart. So a C3 rotation would make the molecule look the same. But what about a horizontal mirror plane? If I imagine looking down the C3 axis (the boron), the mirror plane would be horizontal, cutting through the middle of the molecule. Since each isopropyl is symmetrical and in the same plane, reflecting across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So that would mean a σh plane exists. So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is planar, so any reflection across a plane perpendicular to the C3 axis would work. So in that case, yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

Now, quinuclidine (option D): The structure is norbornane with an amine. Norbornane has a bridged bicyclic structure. Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, I think. Wait, no, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and quinuclidine is a norbornane derivative with an amine group. So the molecule's structure is more complex. I'm trying to think of its symmetry. It has a plane of symmetry, perhaps. If the molecule is symmetric when reflected across a certain plane, say the plane that cuts through the bridge, then it would have a mirror plane. But does it have a threefold axis?

Alternatively, think about the structure. Quinuclidine has an amine group in a specific position. The molecule is a bicyclic structure with two bridgeheads. If I imagine rotating it 120 degrees, would the structure look the same? I'm not so sure. I think that the structure is more symmetric with a C2 axis perhaps, but not C3. So maybe quinuclidine doesn't have C3 symmetry, just C2 or something else. So option D is probably not it.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The name suggests that it's a trifuran system with a benzene ring fused in certain positions. The trifuran has three furan rings connected. The benzo part would be a benzene ring fused to two of the furan rings. The numbering suggests that the substituents (the ketones) are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry across the middle. But does it have a threefold axis? Alternatively, maybe it's a planar molecule with three substituents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a threefold axis of symmetry, but I'm not certain. It's hard to imagine without the structure, but I'm more confident about option C and A.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So, it's a trifuran system with three phenyl groups attached. The positions are such that each phenyl is in a different position. Wait, the substituents (phenyl groups) are probably at positions that are each 120 degrees apart around the central structure. So if the molecule is such that when you rotate it 120 degrees, the phenyl groups swap places but the overall structure remains the same, then it would have C3 symmetry. And if there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would add the h to make it C3h.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar, and each substituent is symmetrically placed, allowing for a mirror plane across the middle.

Wait, but triphenyleno... I'm a bit confused about the structure. Maybe it's a trifuran system where each furan is connected to a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where three benzene rings are fused to a central structure. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, I should think about the nomenclature. The name is [1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. That probably implies that each benzene ring is fused to a furan ring at specific positions. So each of three benzene rings (phenyl groups) is attached to a furan ring. So the main structure is a trifuran, and each of the three furan rings is connected to a benzene ring.

If the three benzene rings are arranged symmetrically around the central trifuran, then perhaps they form a threefold symmetric structure. If each benzene is in a position that's 120 degrees apart, then a rotation of 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. That would give C3 symmetry. If there's also a horizontal mirror plane, then it has C3h.

Alternatively, triphenyleno might form a structure where each substituent is in a symmetrical position, allowing for both the rotation and the reflection.

But going back to option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure is (i-Pr)3BO. Each isopropyl group is attached to boron. Since all three substituents are the same, the molecule should have a high degree of symmetry. The molecule is trigonal planar around B, which would allow for a threefold rotation. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would exist, since each substituent is in the same plane and the structure is symmetric across that plane. So when you look down the C3 axis (the line through B), reflecting across a horizontal plane would leave the molecule unchanged.

So, triisopropyl borate (option C) would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. Wait another thing. The C3h point group requires a threefold axis plus a horizontal mirror plane. For a planar molecule, like something with trigonal symmetry, like benzene, but in this case, it's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So yes, the molecule would have C3 symmetry, and any plane that goes through the central atom and is perpendicular to the rotation axis (like the plane of the molecule) would be a mirror plane. So in this case, yes, the molecule has both a C3 axis and an inversion or a mirror plane. Wait, no, inversion is different. Wait, the presence of a mirror plane would make it C3h.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of another example. For example, BF3 has a trigonal planar structure with three identical substituents. It has a C3 axis and three C2 mirror planes (each through a bond axis). But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Wait, for BF3, the plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis (the plane of the molecule) is a mirror plane. So yes, it has a σh plane, making it C3h.

So, in that case, triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry.

Another option is option A. Let's think about it. If the molecule has three phenyl groups arranged symmetrically, perhaps in a trigonal planar arrangement around a central structure. Then, it would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me imagine looking at the molecule from the top. If each phenyl is equally spaced, then a mirror plane would cut through the center and a phenyl, making the molecule symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is non-planar, which would complicate things.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. But considering the options, triisopropyl borate's structure is more straightforward. Each substituent is the same, and the molecule is planar, so it definitely has both C3 and σh symmetry.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option C is triisopropyl borate. So which option is correct?

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong and triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, another thought: the mirror plane in C3h is a horizontal plane, meaning it's perpendicular to the C3 axis. For a trigonal planar molecule like triisopropyl borate, the plane of the molecule itself is the plane where the mirror would lie. For example, looking down the C3 axis, the mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. But in that case, the mirror plane is σh, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So yes, it would have σh.

Wait, but BF3 doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, BF3's structure is trigonal planar. The mirror planes are the three planes that each bisect a pair of substituents, and they are perpendicular to the C3 axis. Wait, but those are actually vertical mirror planes, not horizontal. Because the C3 axis is perpendicular to the molecular plane. So let me get this right.

The C3h point group includes a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The horizontal plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, right? So for a molecule like cyclopropane, which is trigonal, the symmetry would be D3h, which includes C3 and σh.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the point groups. The C3h point group has a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. When you have a molecule with a C3 axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to that axis (i.e., a horizontal plane for the molecule), then the point group is C3h.

So, in the case of triisopropyl borate, the molecule is trigonal planar with three identical groups. It has a C3 axis, and the mirror plane is the plane of the molecule, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. Therefore, that would be a horizontal mirror plane, making the point group C3h.

Alternatively, if the molecule isn't planar, then perhaps the symmetry is different. But triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, I believe.

Wait, but wait another thing: Triisopropyl borate's structure is like three isopropyl groups attached to boron, which is planar. Each isopropyl group is in the same plane. So yes, the molecule is planar, so the mirror plane is the plane of the molecule, which is the same as the horizontal plane relative to the C3 axis (since the C3 axis is perpendicular to that plane). So, that would make the point group C3h.

So, the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 'triisopropyl borate'. So that would be the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry properties. **C₃h** symmetry involves a threefold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), which is perpendicular to the C₃ axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran system with three phenyl groups attached. The phenyl groups are likely positioned symmetrically around the central structure. If the phenyl groups are arranged at 120° intervals, the molecule would have **C₃** symmetry. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is unclear without the exact structure. While symmetry is possible, the analysis is less definitive compared to other options.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a trifuran system with a benzene ring fused to some of the furan rings. The numbering suggests a complex arrangement, but the symmetry is less clear. It is unlikely to have a threefold rotational axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh) due to the fused benzene and furan rings breaking the required symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
The structure of triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)₃BO, where boron is covalently bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar around the boron atom, with all three substituents arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals. This gives the molecule a **C₃** rotational axis. Additionally, the molecule lies in a plane, which serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, triisopropyl borate has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a structure based on bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. While it has a high degree of symmetry, it does not have a threefold rotational axis (C₃). The molecule's symmetry is dominated by a plane of symmetry rather than a combination of C₃ and σh. Thus, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that has both a threefold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), making it the correct answer.

**Answer: C**
