Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options are four: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with additional higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

Wait, SMEFT is built upon the SM, so it must respect the symmetries that the SM respects. The SM itself is Lorentz invariant, right? So any operator in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. That would mean Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely one that must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM is Poincare invariant. Since SMEFT is an effective theory based on SM, I think the operators must also respect Poincare. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. That would include options 1 and 2.

CP symmetry is another thing. The SM doesn't have a global symmetry for CP, but some of its operators may violate CP. For example, certain processes like the CKM triangle anomaly lead to CP violation. So if the SM already allows for CP violation, then SMEFT operators might also violate CP. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry to be respected by all operators. So option 3 might not be a must.

Wait, but wait. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. The operators are classified by their scaling, but when it comes to symmetries, they must be invariant under the same symmetries as the SM because the SM is part of SMEFT. So if the SM includes CP violation, then SMEFT can include operators that violate CP as well. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry universally. So option 3 is not a must, so it's not a required symmetry.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM is CPT invariant. CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Since the SM respects CPT, any effective theory like SMEFT should also respect this. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

Putting this together: the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. Because Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So for SMEFT, all operators must be Poincare invariant, which implies Lorentz. So the question is whether the operators must respect both 1 and 2, or just 2.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if option 2 (Poincare) is a must, then option 1 (Lorentz) is automatically a must because Poincare includes Lorentz. So looking back at the options, "1,2" is option A,
