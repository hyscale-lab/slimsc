Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's see what each step does.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, they usually undergo elimination reactions, especially if it's a vicinal dihalide, which this is because the bromines are on adjacent carbons. So elimination would form an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the adjacent positions are probably on the same face or something. So the product would be an adamantadiene or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a downfield shift, probably for an alkene's protons. Wait, no, wait. If it's an elimination product, maybe it's more like an alcohol or an epoxide? Wait, no, KOH is a strong base and should cause elimination. So the product is an alkene. But wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Wait, maybe the first reaction isn't elimination. Another possibility is that when two bromines are on a carbon adjacent to a bridgehead, perhaps elimination isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with two bromines, that's unlikely. Wait, could it be that the KOH is acting as a base, causing deprotonation and elimination, forming an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxidation usually involves peracids. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone?

Wait, wait. Let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base. If the structure of adamantane has two bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons, perhaps elimination would form an enol which could tautomerize to a ketone? Or maybe it's dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but then the IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. Wait, but then where would the oxygen come from? Oh, unless there's an oxygen in the starting material, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is all hydrocarbons. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the two bromide groups are replaced by something else. Oh, wait, KOH in such a reaction might cause a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amides or other such compounds.

Wait, let me think differently. The product's IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How to get a ketone from a dihalide?

Oh! Wait, if it's a vicinal dihalide and KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not the usual mechanism. Wait, I think that in some cases, like if the dihalide is adjacent to a bridgehead, strong base can cause elimination to form a ketone through a di-alkoxide intermediate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement is when a diol (1,2-diol) is treated with acid, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. But that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene. But then the NMR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step is a double elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, but I thought epoxidation requires peracids or other agents. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or something else.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene, and the IR is from something else. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone.

Wait, another thought: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes elimination with KOH, perhaps we lose two equivalents of HBr to form an alkene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps another reaction is happening.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a substitution, but with two bromides, you might get a diol. But diols would have OH groups, which would show broad peaks in the NMR, but the NMR given doesn't show that. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Because in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is a singlet for two protons, which could be an epoxide's adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but wait, in epoxides, the protons are adjacent to the oxygen and are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit higher but possible.

Wait, but then the IR would show an epoxide's C-O-C stretch, which is around 1250 cm-1 and 1050 cm-1. But the IR here is at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or maybe an aldehyde. But the product is a light yellow solid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Unless each elimination forms a ketone. Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination, each forms a carbonyl. Like, each Br is replaced by an O- group, which upon protonation becomes -OH, but maybe in the presence of a strong base, it becomes a ketone? I'm not very clear on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an epoxide, and then when heated with KOH, something else happens. Wait, no, the first step is heating with KOH to form product 1.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, 1,3-diketone adamantane. But how would that form from a dihalide with KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. No, that's for carbocation shifts.

Alternatively, let me think about the NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group. Maybe an epoxide's CH2 would be at that region. Wait, in an epoxide, the CH2 groups are typically around 3-4 ppm, but perhaps in a strained ring like adamantane, they could be higher.

Wait, in an epoxide, the neighboring protons are deshielded due to the ring strain, so maybe 4.79 is possible. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first step forms a diol, but then the conditions are such that it gets dehydrated to form a ketone. But that would require acid, not KOH.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene and then some other reaction. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a diene, but I don't see the connection to the IR peak.

Wait, maybe the initial product is not an elimination product but a substitution. If each Br is replaced by an -OH group, but that would give a diol. The NMR would show broad peaks for OH, but the product is a light yellow solid, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. So, 1,3-diketone adamantane. How would that form? Maybe each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon elimination with KOH, each bridgehead becomes a carbonyl. That would require each Br to be adjacent to a position that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and upon dehydrohalogenation, each adjacent C-Br forms a double bond, but that would make a diene. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. The IR then wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone via the formation of an enol which then tautomerizes. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a cyclopropane ring. No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, and the IR is from something else. But then the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the C=C, not 1720.

Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh wait! Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is added, each Br is replaced by an O- group, forming an alkoxide. Then, the two alkoxide groups could lead to the formation of a ketone through some kind of elimination. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon adjacent to a methyl group. So when KOH removes the Br, the adjacent C-H bonds could break, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So each elimination would form a carbonyl.

Wait, so for each Br, when KOH removes it, the adjacent C-H is abstracted, leading to a double bond, but if the structure allows, maybe it becomes a carbonyl. Or perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, but two eliminations would lead to two carbonyl groups, making a diketone. So product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. That would fit the IR peak at 1720 cm-1.

Then, looking at the NMR: 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps. But wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is flanked by carbons, not CH2.

Wait, but perhaps the structure after elimination is a bridgehead with a carbonyl, so perhaps the adjacent CH2 is the one at 4.79 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 ppm is part of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. So, in that case, the NMR would show peaks for the adjacent CH2 groups to the carbonyls. Let's say each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group; that would explain the 4.79 (2H) as a singlet, perhaps part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is an -OCH2- group, but that would be more like an ether. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is an epoxide, the 4.79 could be the two protons on the epoxide ring. Then, the IR wouldn't fit, though.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But given that product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or undergoes some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diketone, then reacting with Al isopropoxide might form some kind of enol ether or undergo a condensation reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires aromatic rings, which adamantane doesn't have.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of dehydration to form an alkene or an ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and treatment with Al isopropoxide would cause ring-opening, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene with some substituents. Then, treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of addition or polymerization.

Hmm.

Moving on, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide to form product 3. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Ozonolysis typically breaks alkenes into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Wait, but if product 2 is a ketone, I'm not sure how that would react with ozone. Alternatively, product 2 could have a conjugated diene or some other structure that would form a double bond upon reaction with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then, product 2 could be a diol formed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, which might protonate the epoxide. But then, when you ozonolyze a diol, I'm not sure what would happen.

Wait, let's try to map it all out.

Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows 1720 cm-1 → likely a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone or maybe an ester. Since it's heated with KOH, which is a base, perhaps elimination is the key. So product 1 is a ketone.

Product 1 is then heated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts, but without an aromatic ring, maybe it's used for acylation or alkylation elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's used to form an acylium ion, which could undergo some kind of cyclization or other reaction.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol that then undergoes some kind of elimination upon treatment with Al isopropoxide to form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide causes it to undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, forming a diol. But then product 2 would be a diol, and ozonolysis wouldn't have much to act on.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Let me think again. If product 1 is an alkene, then product 2 could be an epoxide formed via an acid-catalyzed reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. But then the ozonolysis step wouldn't apply.

Hmm. Maybe I should move to the ozonolysis part. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it. The reaction conditions are at -78°C, which is typical for ozonolysis to form ozonides without further decomposition, leading to cleavage upon workup.

So after ozonolysis and addition of dimethyl sulfide, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the NMR spectrum of product 3. The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent).

So, perhaps product 3 has some carbonyl groups adjacent to protons, which would be deshielded.

Wait, perhaps the initial product 1 is a diepoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure with four bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead carbons opposite each other.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, forming two ketone groups. So product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane. So structure would have two ketones on the bridgeheads.

Then, when product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization or rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but again, without an aromatic ring, that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: Al isopropoxide could act as a catalyst for some kind of dehydration or elimination, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and Al isopropoxide doesn't react with it, but maybe product 2 remains the same as product 1. That doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed by some kind of aldol condensation, forming a new ring or structure. But again, I'm not certain.

Moving on, product 2 is ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Wait, perhaps product 2 has a cyclopropane ring or some strained structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about product 3's NMR. The most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyls deshield adjacent protons. The coupling pattern would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

So, for example, if a proton is next to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons, it might be a triplet. Or if it's adjacent to another proton that's split into a triplet, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but considering the options, the coupling could be a triplet, doublet of triplets, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and each of those protons is coupled to two others, leading to a triplet.

Wait, in the case of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, each proton would see the two neighboring protons on the same carbon, leading to a triplet. But if there's another set of neighboring protons, like from an adjacent CH2 group, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and has two neighboring protons on either side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH group is between two CH2 groups. So each of the CH protons would be split by the adjacent CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two protons, so each coupling would split into a triplet.

So, the CH proton would be a triplet of triplets, as each coupling from the adjacent CH2 groups would split it again.

Alternatively, if the CH is adjacent to a CH2 that is split into a triplet, then the proton would be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a cyclopropane ring or a bridged structure with a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard to predict the NMR.

Wait, perhaps I should try to outline the possible structures step by step.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with KOH):

Assuming elimination to form a diene: 1,3-diene adamantane. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone. Maybe each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diketone.

Then product 2 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Maybe it doesn't react, but perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but no aromatic ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a catalyst for some kind of elimination to form a double bond. So product 2 could be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 (an alkene) would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, leading to product 3.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was in product 2.

Now, the NMR of product 3 would show protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, which are deshielded.

So, for example, if product 3 has a structure like two carbonyls connected by a CH2 group, the protons on the CH2 would be next to the carbonyl and would split into a triplet due to coupling with each other.

Wait, but the question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Alternatively, if the structure has a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl and that CH is next to two other CH2 groups, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but considering the adamantane structure, after ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of product 3 is such that a CH is between two CH2 groups, each adjacent to a carbonyl.

So, the CH proton would be next to two CH2 groups, each with two protons. So the coupling would be from the neighboring CH2 groups.

Each CH2 group would split the CH into a triplet. But since there are two such CH2 groups adjacent, perhaps the splitting is a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, if the CH is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, the coupling pattern when a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons can be a doublet of doublets, triplet of triplets, etc., depending on the number of neighboring protons and their coupling constants.

Assuming the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, the coupling would involve two neighboring groups. Each CH2 has two protons, so each would split the peak into a triplet. But if the two CH2 groups are equivalent, perhaps the splitting is a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if they're not equivalent, it could be a more complex pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two different protons, say one on each side, each with two neighbors, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Looking at the options:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

Hmm.

If the proton is coupled to two sets of two protons each, the splitting would be each set causing a triplet. So the first set would split it into a doublet, and the second set would split each of those into a triplet, making a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order.

Alternatively, if it's coupled to two equivalent sets of two protons, it might be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

So, the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination reaction. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the bromine atoms are replaced by carbonyl groups, forming a 1,3-diketone adamantane.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 (1,3-diketone adamantane) is heated with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, may promote a rearrangement or further reaction. However, the exact nature of product 2 is unclear. It is likely that product 2 retains a carbonyl group or undergoes a structural change that sets it up for the next reaction.

3. **Ozonolysis and Workup**:  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. If product 2 contains a double bond, ozonolysis would break it, resulting in product 3 with carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent. The most deshielded proton is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If this proton is part of a CH group flanked by two CH₂ groups, it would experience coupling with the protons on both adjacent CH₂ groups. Each CH₂ group would split the signal into a triplet, and the combination of two such couplings would result in a "triplet of triplets" pattern.

Given the options provided, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
