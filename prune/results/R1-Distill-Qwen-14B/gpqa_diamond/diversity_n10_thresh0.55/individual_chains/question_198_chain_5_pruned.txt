Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with stability constants and complex formation. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? Oh right! I remember that [Co(SCN)_2] is the blue one. So that's the dithiocyanato complex, which means it has two SCN- ligands. So I'm looking for the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2- relative to all possible cobalt species.

Stability constants (β) are given for each complex. Stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. So for each complex, the β is the product of the ion concentrations in the numerator and the complex in the denominator.

Let me list out the complexes:

- Co^2+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)^- (monothiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) (dithiocyanato, neutral)
- [Co(SCN)_3]^(–) (trithiocyanato)
- [Co(SCN)_4]^2– (tetrathiocyanato)

Wait, but the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, which would be Co(SCN)^+. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: for each step, the formation of the next complex.

So the formation steps would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ (β1 = 9)
Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2 =40)
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^-
