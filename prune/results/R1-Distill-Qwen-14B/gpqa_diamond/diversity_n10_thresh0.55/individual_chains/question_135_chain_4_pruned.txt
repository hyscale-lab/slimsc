Okay, I have this physics problem about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. So, the question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a given mass. 

First, let me read the problem again. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what this means, but I think it describes how the boson X interacts with fermions. The fermions are represented by ψ_f, which I suppose are different types of fermions like quarks or leptons.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So we're looking for all possible fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into, considering conservation laws and the mass of X. 

Wait, in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson. The condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is that the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Also, because fermions have spin-½, the decay products must obey the spin and other conservation laws like charge and baryon number.

So, for X → f f̄, the mass of X (6 GeV) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. Because each f has a mass m_f, so 2m_f ≤ m_X. 

Wait, but wait, wait. Fermions come in different flavors with different masses. For example, the top quark is very heavy, around 173 GeV, while others are lighter. Let's list the known fermions and their masses (approximate):

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, assumed massless for most purposes.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, it's written as \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps the interaction term involves ψ_f and ψ_f, so the fermion and its antiquark? Or wait, ψ_f might be a Dirac spinor, which can represent both particles and antiparticles depending on the context. Hmm, maybe the interaction is with a specific type of fermion, like a charged lepton or a quark.

Wait, the problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Let me parse that. The term is -λ f f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps f is a Yukawa coupling factor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Yukawa interaction term. 

In Yukawa theory, the interaction is between a scalar field (like the Higgs) and fermions. The term would look like g φ ψ
