Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So, for two states, the ratio n_i/n_j is equal to exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference Î”E is 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote E1 as the higher energy level and E2 as the lower one. But wait, the problem says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, so I think it means the population in the higher energy state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

So, for star_1, n1 (excited state) / n2 (ground state) = 2. Similarly, for star_2, n1' / n2' = 1, assuming they're in LTE.

Wait, no,
