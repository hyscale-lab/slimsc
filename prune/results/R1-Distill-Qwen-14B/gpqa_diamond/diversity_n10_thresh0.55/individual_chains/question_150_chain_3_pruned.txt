Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Oh wait, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm. The NMR data is provided, and after reacting with specific reagents, I need to find the final product from the options.

The reagents are:
1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH and Heat.

I remember that NaNO2 and HCl are typically used in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. So maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group which will be converted into a diazonium salt.

Looking at the NMR data:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That sounds like an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet might suggest coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but in an aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet. Maybe it's an aromatic proton instead? Or maybe it's an aldehyde with some coupling, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Not sure yet.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Downfield aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, perhaps adjacent to a substituent.
- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe some coupling. Could be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group or part of a conjugated system, like vinyl protons.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an O. So perhaps an OCH2 group.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has a benzene ring attached to another structure. Let me sketch a possible structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, X=0 (but wait, there's an O and N), wait the formula is C8H9NO. So X is 1 O and 1 N, but in the calculation, they are treated as atoms, not as unsaturation. So:

Each ring or double bond is one degree. So:

Degrees = (2*8 + 2 -9 - (O and N as 0) )/2. Wait, no, the formula is C8H9NO. The general formula is CnH2nOxNy. So, the calculation is (2*8 +2 -9 - (O + N))/2. O and N are considered as their valence, but I think the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is
