Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, in the context of LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms relates to their temperature. So higher excitation might mean higher temperature because more energy is available to excite the atoms.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's the same as k (Boltzmann constant) multiplied by a certain temperature. Because I remember the formula ΔE = k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Let me think, k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then T would be 1 K? Because 1.38e-23 J/K * 1 K = 1.38e-23 J. Oh, interesting. So the energy difference is exactly k*T where T is 1 K. So that's a key point here.

Now, the excitation level relates to the Boltzmann distribution. The fraction of atoms in an excited state is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, the
