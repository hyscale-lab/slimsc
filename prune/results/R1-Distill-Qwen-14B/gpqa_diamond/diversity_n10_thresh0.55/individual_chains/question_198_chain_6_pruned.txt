Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, I remember that Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the blue complex. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. So I'm looking for the concentration of this species relative to all possible cobalt species.

Hmm, so first, the stability constants (β) are the formation constants for each complex. The formation constant tells us how much a complex is favored over its ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The general reaction for each complex would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ , with β_n being the stability constant.

The possible complexes here are n=1, 2, 3, 4. So [Co(SCN)]^3+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^+, and [Co(SCN)_4]^−.

Wait, no, wait. The charge on the complex would be Co^2+ plus n SCN^- (each SCN^- is -1). So for n=1, [Co(SCN)]^3+ (because 2+ + (-1) = +1, but wait no: 2+ plus 1 SCN^- is 2+ -1 = +1 charge. So [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let's think: Each Co^2+ combines with SCN^- to form complexes. The overall charge on each complex is 2+ + (n * (-1)).

So for n=1: 2+ + (-1) = +1 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

n=2: 2+ + 2*(-1) =
