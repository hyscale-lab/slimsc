Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. So the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to move it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

First, I should remember what the fundamental state means. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the state with the lowest possible vibrational and rotational energy. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next higher energy state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that means the lowest energy transition, which might involve either a change in vibration, rotation, or both. 

Wait, no, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (rotational quantum number J=0). But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state (v=1) or its rotational state (J increases by 1 or more). But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the lowest energy transition would be the one that requires the least energy, probably the vibrational transition. Because rotational transitions usually require lower energy than vibrational ones? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, I remember that the vibrational energy levels
