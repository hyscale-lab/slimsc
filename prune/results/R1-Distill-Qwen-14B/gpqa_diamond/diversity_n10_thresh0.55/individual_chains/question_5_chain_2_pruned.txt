Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. So, the problem is about a muon, which is like a lepton, similar to an electron but heavier. The operator in question is vector P, and we need to find its eigenvector for an eigenvalue of +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane, so the vector n is in the x-z plane. Oh wait, no, the eigenvector is for the operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is probably the component of P along that direction.

Wait, the question says the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I think we're dealing with the spin operator here. Because in quantum mechanics, especially for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ± ħ/2.

Let me think. The given components of operator P are:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]
- P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each P_i is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma matrices. That makes sense. So the operator P is the vector operator with these components.

The problem asks for the eigenvector of P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, but the direction is in x-z, so the angle theta (if we consider spherical coordinates) would have phi = 0, perhaps?
