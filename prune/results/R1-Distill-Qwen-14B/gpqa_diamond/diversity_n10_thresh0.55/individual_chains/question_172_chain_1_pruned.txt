Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of two energy levels in a system.

The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the relationship between their effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. Oh wait, but in this case, perhaps the statistical weights are the same? Because the question doesn't mention any difference in g, so I'll assume they're the same. That simplifies things because then the ratio would just depend on the exponentials.

So the ratio of the populations would be n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). Wait no, wait. The ratio of the excited state to the ground state or lower state. Oh wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the higher energy level is less populated. So if n_higher is the population of the higher level, and n_lower the lower, then n_higher/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE
