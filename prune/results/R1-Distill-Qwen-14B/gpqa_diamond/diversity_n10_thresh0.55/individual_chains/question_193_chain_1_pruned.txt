Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, that's N ∝ 1/plx^5, or N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant.

And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. So I think they're asking about the relationship between the number of stars and distance. So I need to find how N depends on distance r.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Right, the parallax in parsecs (plx) is 1 over the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So if r increases, plx decreases because you're farther away. So plx is inversely proportional to r.

So substituting plx into the equation. Since N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, that would mean:

N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Because plx = 1/r. So substituting that in:

N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 over that is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the substitution.

If plx = 1/r, then 1
