Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me read the question carefully again.

So, the problem is about a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector given the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this value.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector can be written in terms of angles θ and φ. But wait, since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal angle) should be zero. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the x-z plane is a plane where y is zero. So, any direction in the x-z plane would have a direction vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But since the entire direction is in x-z, φ could be any angle, but the direction is confined. Wait, perhaps the direction is given by θ from the z-axis and φ from the x-axis? Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Oh wait, maybe the direction vector is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but for the x-z plane, φ can be any value, but the direction lies in that plane.

But wait, the operator is given as the vector P, which is in the direction n. So the operator P should be the component along n, which is the dot product of the Pauli vectors with n. So, P = n · σ (times ħ/2, perhaps?), but I'll have to think about that.

Wait, the problem gives P_x, P_y, P_z as specific matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, each component is an operator. So, the operator for the component along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz), because the y-component is zero. So, n_y = 0. So, the operator P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of this operator. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors would be two-dimensional spin states.

Let me write down each component matrix:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So, the operator P is given by P = nx Px + nz Pz, since n is in x-z plane and ny=0.

Substituting, P = nx*(ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + nz*(ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz ] ]

Because when you add the matrices, the diagonal elements are nz for (1,1) and -nz for (2,2), and the off-diagonals are nx.

So, the matrix is:

[[nz, nx],
 [nx, -nz]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

Let me write P - (ħ/2) I:

(ħ/2) [ [nz - 1, nx], [nx, -nz -1 ] ].

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, it's [[ħ/2, 0], [0, ħ/2]].

So, subtracting that from P gives:

For each element:

P_11 - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(nz) - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(nz - 1)
P_12 remains (ħ/2)(nx)
P_21 remains (ħ/2)(nx)
P_22 - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(-nz) - (ħ/2)(1) = (ħ/2)(-nz -1)

So, the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

(ħ/2) [ [nz -1, nx], [nx, -nz -1 ] ]

Wait, but I can factor out ħ/2, so the equation becomes (P - (ħ/2) I) being a matrix with elements (nz -1, nx), (nx, -nz -1), multiplied by ħ/2. So, setting this multiplied by the vector (a, b) to zero.

So, the equations are:

(nz-1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

I can write these as:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Let me denote this as a system of equations:

Equation 1: (nz -1) a + nx b = 0
Equation 2: nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Since the system must have non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors), the determinant must be zero. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for a and b.

Let me take equation 1:

(nz -1) a = - nx b
=> a = [ - nx / (nz -1) ] * b

Similarly, from equation 2:

nx a = (nz +1) b
=> a = [ (nz +1) / nx ] b

So, setting the two expressions for a equal:

[ - nx / (nz -1) ] = [ (nz +1) / nx ]

Multiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx:

- nx^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1)
=> -nx^2 = nz^2 - 1

=> nz^2 = 1 - nx^2

But since n is a unit vector, we have nx^2 + nz^2 =1, so this equation is consistent.

Wait, but since n is a direction in x-z, with nx^2 + nz^2 = 1.

So, the condition holds. So, the equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So, a = [ (nz +1) / nx ] * b

But wait, nx could be zero. Oh, but if nx is zero, then the direction is along z, so n would be (0,0, ±1). Then, the operator P would be P_z, and the eigenvectors are |+> = (1,0) and |-> = (0,1). But the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so the eigenvector would be (1,0), which is the first option. Wait, but let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it using angles θ and φ. Wait, but for a direction in x-z plane, the angle φ is zero? Or perhaps it's better to think in terms of spherical coordinates. Wait, no. Let me think: in spherical coordinates, a direction in x-z plane (i.e., in the plane spanned by x and z axes) would have φ = 0 or π, because the y-component is zero. Wait, no, φ is the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis. So, if the direction is in x-z, then the projection onto the xy-plane is zero, so φ could be any angle, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the direction vector as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but if it's in x-z plane, then cosφ would be zero, but wait, no. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the direction using an angle θ from the z-axis. So, for a direction in the x-z plane, the components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because the direction lies in x and z. Wait, no, wait: if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then the direction vector would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But if the direction is in x-z plane, then the y-component is zero, so sinθ sinφ = 0. So, sinφ must be zero, which implies φ=0 or φ=π. So, in this case, the direction can be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=0, or (-sinθ, 0, cosθ) when φ=π. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps I can just express the direction as (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz²=1. So, nx = sinθ cosφ, nz = cosθ, but since in x-z plane, perhaps φ is zero, so nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the direction in terms of an angle θ from the z-axis, making the direction vector (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, substituting into the expressions for a and b.

Earlier, I found a = [ (nz +1) / nx ] * b.

So, plugging in nz = cosθ and nx = sinθ:

a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] * b.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to (a, b) = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ, 1 ] * b.

Wait, but perhaps I should factor this differently. Let me write it as:

a = ( (cosθ +1) / sinθ ) * b.

So, the vector can be written as ( (cosθ +1), sinθ ) multiplied by 1/sinθ, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation there.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector can be written as any scalar multiple, so perhaps I can express it in terms of sinθ and cosθ. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose b = sinθ, so a = (cosθ +1).

So, the vector is (cosθ +1, sinθ).

Wait, but I need to check normalization. The components would be ( (cosθ +1), sinθ ), but perhaps I should normalize this vector.

Wait, let's compute the magnitude squared of this vector:

( (cosθ +1) )^2 + ( sinθ )^2 = cos²θ + 2 cosθ +1 + sin²θ.

Which simplifies to (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2 cosθ +1 = 1 + 2 cosθ +1 = 2 (1 + cosθ).

So, the magnitude is sqrt(2(1+cosθ)).

Hmm, to normalize, the vector would be ( (cosθ +1)/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)), sinθ/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) ).

Simplifying, sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ) is cos(θ/2), and sinθ/(sqrt(2(1+cosθ))) is sinθ/(2 cos(θ/2)) ) because 1+cosθ=2 cos²(θ/2), so sqrt(2(1+cosθ))= sqrt(4 cos²(theta/2)) )= 2 |cos(theta/2)|. Assuming theta is between 0 and pi, so cos(theta/2) is positive.

So, the normalized vector components are:

( (1+cosθ)/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) ), (sinθ)/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) )

Which simplifies to:

sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) * sinθ ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute each component.

For the first component: (cosθ +1)/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ) * (1+cosθ)/(sqrt(1+cosθ)) ) Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Wait, cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1.

So, 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2).

So, sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( cos²(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So, the second component is sinθ/(sqrt(2(1+cosθ))) )

Which is (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) / ( sqrt(2 * 2 cos²(theta/2)) ) )

The denominator is sqrt(4 cos²(theta/2)) ) = 2 |cos(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi, cos(theta/2) is positive, so denominator is 2 cos(theta/2).

So, numerator is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), denominator is 2 cos(theta/2).

So, the second component simplifies to sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, but earlier I had ( (cos theta +1), sin theta ), but after normalization, it's ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), because:

( (1+cosθ)/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) ) = sqrt( (1+cosθ)/2 ) = cos(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ/sqrt(2(1+cosθ)) ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos(theta/2)] ) = sin(theta/2).

So, the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but wait, the eigenvectors are spin-1/2 states, which are typically dimensionless, but the options include hbar multiplied in the components. That seems odd because eigenvectors are usually normalized vectors, so their components shouldn't have units like hbar.

Wait, looking back, the question says "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So, the components should be dimensionless.

Looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I derived.

Option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ), which looks more like the spherical coordinates for a 3D vector, but the question is about a 2D spin state.

Option D has factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which suggests a specific normalization, perhaps for a different scenario.

Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the operator P is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvectors are two-component spinors. So, the eigenvectors should be of the form ( a, b ), where |a|^2 + |b|^2=1.

In the case where the direction is along the z-axis (nx=0), the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (1, 0), which matches option C when theta=0, because cos(0/2)=1, and sin(0/2)=0.

Similarly, when the direction is along x (nz=0, nx=1, theta=pi/2), the operator P becomes (ħ/2) * [[0 1],[1 0]], so the eigenvectors are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), corresponding to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So, for theta=pi/2, the eigenvector would be (0,1) from the earlier formula, but wait, let's compute:

Wait, when theta=pi/2, nz = cos(theta) = 0, so nx=1.

So, the eigenvector would be ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) = ( cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ) = (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is correct for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 case.

So, that seems correct.

Looking at option C, yes, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But what about the other options?

Option D seems to have a normalization factor sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which doesn't match the general case I derived.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the direction vector's magnitude. No, because the direction is a unit vector, so it's already normalized.

Wait, but perhaps the question includes the Planck constant in the eigenvector, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So, perhaps the options with hbar are incorrect.

Looking at option D: the components are sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. That can't be right because eigenvectors are normalized vectors without units.

So, the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices. Substituting $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, the operator becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z \right).
\]
Using the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, this simplifies to:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]
where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $\vec{P}$, this becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we obtain:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This simplifies to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
From the first equation:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} b.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \frac{2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)}{-2\sin^2(\theta/2)} b = -\cot(\theta/2) b.
\]
Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} -\cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The normalization condition is:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
\]
Substituting $a = -\cot(\theta/2) b$, we find:
\[
|-\cot(\theta/2) b|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \implies \left(\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1\right)|b|^2 = 1.
\]
Using the identity $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, we get:
\[
|b|^2 = \sin^2(\theta/2), \quad |b| = \sin(\theta/2).
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \sin(\theta/2) \begin{bmatrix} -\cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ is incorrect because it introduces $\hbar$ into the components, which is dimensionally inconsistent for eigenvectors.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because it describes a 3D spherical coordinate system, not a 2D spinor.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary normalization factors and $\hbar$.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

**Answer: C**
