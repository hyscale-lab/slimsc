Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives a density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles, so they involve a mixture of these projectors.

Wait, the given ρ looks like it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Let me compute what ρ actually is. Each term |0⟩⟨0| is a projector for state 0, and same for |1⟩. So when I add them together and multiply by 1/2, ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries 1/2 and 1/2. Because:

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]
Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], then multiply by 1/2 → [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

So ρ is a 2x2 identity matrix scaled by 1/2. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state can be represented as a point on the unit sphere in 3D space. For a pure state |θ, φ⟩, the Bloch vector r is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), and the state is represented as (|0⟩ + e^{iφ} |1⟩) cos(θ/2), etc.

But wait, density matrices for mixed states are represented as points inside the Bloch sphere. For a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2, the density matrix is diagonal with 1/2, 1/2.

In the Bloch sphere formalism, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in this form, then r will be the vector we're looking for.

Let me try that. Our ρ is (I)/2, because I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So,

ρ = (I)/2 = (I + 0·σ)/2. That implies that the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Because the coefficients for the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) are all zero.

Wait,
