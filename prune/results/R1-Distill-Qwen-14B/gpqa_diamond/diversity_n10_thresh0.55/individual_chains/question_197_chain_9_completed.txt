Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in a substitution reaction, especially in the context of the Hunsdiecker reaction or maybe the hydrolysis of certain groups. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a bromide or iodide, especially allylic or benzylic positions, red phosphorus and HI can cause elimination or substitution. But wait, another thought: sometimes, when there's a carbonyl group present, like a ketone or ester, red phosphorus and HI can lead to a cleavage. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure, let me think.

Looking at the data given, Compound X's IR and NMR spectra. Let me analyze them.

IR Data:
The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm-1, which is typical for O-H or N-H stretches. But the strong peaks here are at 1720 cm-1 and 1610 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But the peak at 1610 might suggest conjugated double bonds or possibly an aromatic ring. Aromatic C=C usually have peaks around 1600-1450 cm-1, so that makes sense. The 1450 cm-1 is consistent with aromatic ring substitution.

NMR Data:
1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is indicative of an aldehyde proton. But wait, wait. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes, if it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, that would be a broad peak. However, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, another thought: if it's a carbonyl adjacent to an aromatic ring, perhaps as part of a benzaldehyde structure. Or maybe it's the acidic proton of a phenol. Wait, but phenols are usually broader than that, and their protons are around 5 ppm, so maybe not. Or maybe it's an enol tautomer? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to two protons. So that's a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into two doublets (each with J coupling). So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two groups, like a substituent and a carbonyl group.

The next peak is 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, perhaps a CH next to an electronegative atom or in a chiral environment. Maybe a methylene group adjacent to something. Or perhaps it's a CH near an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons, maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative group or in a chain. Like part of a longer chain, maybe connected to an aromatic ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. Wait, no. Wait, a doublet (d) means it has two neighbors. Wait, 3H as a doublet would probably be a CH3 group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Like a CH3 attached to a CH that's next to another CH2 or something. Like maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group. Alternatively, it could be a (CH3)2CH- group. Wait, but 1.4 ppm is a bit low for a CH3 adjacent to a CH2, but maybe it's an isopropyl group.

Lastly, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet integrating to three protons. The triplet suggests it's attached to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2. So maybe a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl or propyl chain ending with a CH3.

Putting the NMR together:

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say, for example, that the substituents are a carbonyl group and another group. Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like p-hydroxybenzaldehyde? No, wait, because if it were a hydroxyl group, the peak would be around 5 ppm, not 10. So perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent para to it.

Wait, but the other substituent on the benzene would be connected to a chain. Let's think. The 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde (CHO), para to another substituent, which is a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something like that.

Looking at the other peaks:

At 2.9 ppm, m, 1H: maybe a CH group connected to something.

At 1.7 ppm, m, 2H: perhaps a CH2 next to the CH.

At 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: maybe a CH(CH3) group.

At 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: that's a CH2CH2CH3, so maybe a propyl group.

Putting it together: Let me try to sketch the structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents opposite each other (para). One is a CHO group (from 10.5 ppm), and the other is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2 group? No, wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's at the end of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe it's a propyl group, but attached as CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain. Let me think, the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let's try to figure out the substituents. The substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes a CH group (the 2.9 ppm peak) connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm), which in turn is connected to another CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, let's consider substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Hmm, but that would make the structure something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but the 1H NMR doesn't show all the protons in that group.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a terminal CH2CH2CH3 (like an ethyl group attached to another CH2). Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which usually comes from a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. So perhaps it's a propyl group, CH2CH2CH3, but attached to a branching point.

Alternatively, the substituent is (CH2)2CHCH3, but that's a pentyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. Let's see: isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, no. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

An isobutyl group is (CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No. Wait, isobutyl is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CHCH3. So, the substituent is a butyl group, more specifically, a sec-butyl group. Let me explain: a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring via a CH2 group. Then, perhaps a CH group (from 2.9 ppm, m, 1H) connected to another CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and that CH3 is attached to a larger chain ending with a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring. But then, the NMR peaks would be different. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that would give a triplet for the CH3, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Let's see:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 is attached to the benzene, then a CH that's attached to a CH2CH3 and another CH2 group? Hmm, not quite. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-... No, perhaps.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at all the peaks:

- The aldehyde proton at 10.5 ppm (1H)
- The two doublets in aromatic region: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): so this is a para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents opposite each other.

Assuming the substituents are a CHO group and another group. Let's say the other substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible structures.

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. So that's a carbonyl group. The presence of 1610 cm-1 suggests there are double bonds, possibly aromatic.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, which suggests two substituents in para positions. One substituent is the aldehyde (CHO), the other is a group that causes the downfield shifts. So, perhaps the other substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which would make the aromatic protons more downfield.

Wait, but an aldehyde is an electron-withdrawing group. So the other substituent could be an alkyl group, which is electron-donating, but that might not fit. Wait, but if the substituents are in the para positions, one being an aldehyde (EWG) and the other being an alkyl group (EDG), that would cause the ortho and para protons to be downfield shifted. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that would complicate things. Wait, but the aldehyde is already a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone or another aldehyde. But no, the IR only shows one strong carbonyl peak, which is at 1720. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that would conflict since the aldehyde is at 10.5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, but then the aldehyde would be another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with another substituent, perhaps an ester or a ketone. But the IR only shows a single strong carbonyl. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, another thought: the aldehyde (CHO) is perhaps part of a larger substituent. Like a benzaldehyde attached to a chain.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think about the reaction.

Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts alkyl halides into alkenes via elimination, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, in the presence of a carbonyl group, red phosphorus and HI can cleave it.

Wait, wait, another possibility: the Clemmensen reduction. That's when a ketone or aldehyde is reduced to an alkane using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But wait, Clemmensen uses HCl, while in this case, it's HI. Maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Alternatively, if the compound has a carbonyl group and an adjacent leaving group, maybe it's a substitution. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl is replaced. So, for example, if X is an aryl aldehyde (like benzaldehyde), reacting with HI in presence of red phosphorus would form an aryl iodide. But why would that substitution happen? Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for the substitution of halides, but in this case, maybe the aldehyde is being converted into an iodide.

Wait, no. Aldehydes are not typically substituted in that way. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a larger structure, like a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent that's a bromide or iodide.

Wait, but the question says Compound X reacts with red P and HI. Maybe X is an aldehyde with an adjacent leaving group, like a bromide. Then, the reaction could substitute that bromide with iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a conjugated system. For example, if X is an allylic bromide, then red phosphorus and HI could cause elimination, forming an alkene. Alternatively, if X is a benzyl bromide, substitution would occur.

Wait, another thought: The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe X is a benzaldehyde derivative with an ester group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzoic acid derivative. The IR would have a carbonyl around 1700, which fits. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm would be the -COOH proton, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But that's a single proton. Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 peak is a broad singlet of 1H, which fits a carboxylic acid.

But wait, let me think: if X is a benzoic acid, like 4-ethylbenzoic acid, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps decarboxylation occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are more commonly used in other types of reactions, such as the substitution of allylic or benzylic halides.

Alternatively, maybe X has a carbonyl group and an adjacent bromide. So, perhaps X is a ketone with a bromide adjacent. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI could lead to substitution, replacing the bromide with iodide. But in the product, it's possible that the carbonyl remains.

Wait, but the options don't have a ketone. Looking at the options:

Options are:
A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So all options either have benzoic acid, isobutyl or sec-butyl groups.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. The IR for that would have a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1 (acid is higher, around 1700-1725). So 1720 would fit. The aromatic protons would be as para-substituted.

But wait, the NMR of the starting material (Compound X) would need to have a benzoic acid group. But in the starting material, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet, which would be the COOH proton. But in the options, the product is either a benzoic acid or not.

Wait, but in the starting material, if it's a benzoic acid, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Maybe the HI would substitute a leaving group, but where?

Alternatively, if X is an ester, which upon reaction with HI would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI are typically for elimination or substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of a bromide or iodide attached to a carbonyl group. For example, if X is an aryl bromide with a carbonyl group, perhaps a benzyl bromide, then the substitution would occur.

But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a singlet of 1H, which is possibly an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. So let's think: If X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, then after substitution, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a bromide somewhere. For example, 4-bromo-benzaldehyde. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would substitute the bromide with iodide, giving 4-iodo-benzaldehyde. But that doesn't align with the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide on a chain attached to the benzene ring. For example, a benzyl bromide attached via a chain. Then, substitution would replace Br with I.

Wait, but the options are about products, so let me think about the reaction. When red phosphorus and HI are used with a halide, it's often a substitution reaction, replacing the halide with iodide. So, if X is a benzyl bromide, the product would be a benzyl iodide. But none of the options are benzyl iodides.

Alternatively, maybe X has a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group. For instance, perhaps X is an alpha-bromo ketone or ester. Then, substitution would replace Br with I.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an allylic bromide, and the reaction leads to an elimination, forming an alkene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and a bromide on an adjacent carbon, the reaction could lead to a substitution, turning the bromide into iodide. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, it could undergo a reduction.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached to the second carbon. But I don't see how this would form from the given reaction.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's cumene, I think. Isobutyl group in position 1 (which is para to methyl in position 4).

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in position 4.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the benzene has a sec-butyl group in position 1 and a methyl in position 4.

Hmm. Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is a substitution reaction. So, if the starting material (Compound X) has a bromide or iodide that is replaced by another iodide, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps X is a halide attached to a chain, which is then iodinated.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the NMR of Compound X again.

The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, 1H. If it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -COOH proton. But if X is a carboxylic acid, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is unclear. Alternatively, it's an aldehyde.

Wait, another possibility: The 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Then the IR's 1720 cm-1 would be the aldehyde's carbonyl. But wait, aldehyde carbonyls are usually around 2800 (stretch) and 1720 would be a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the aldehyde's C=O is around 1720 cm-1, so that fits. So the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton.

So, the structure would be a benzaldehyde (with substituents), plus a chain.

The aromatic protons are two doublets, so para substitution. So, the benzaldehyde has another substituent para to the aldehyde group.

The substituent's NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

So, the substituent is a chain attached to the benzene. Let's think of the substituent as being a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show all of those.

Let me count the protons:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m): perhaps a CH group connected to two other groups.
- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m): maybe a CH2 connected to the CH and another CH2.
- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d): a CH3 connected to a CH.
- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t): a CH2CH3.

Putting it together, the substituent could be a isobutyl group. Wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. But that would have a CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, the substituent's structure would be: benzene-CHO attached to a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Not quite. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, here's another approach: The substituent has a structure that has a CH group (from 2.9 ppm), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4), and that CH3 is connected to another CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t).

Wait, that would make the substituent as CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the group is -(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, but let's think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a CH2 connected to a CH that's connected to a CH2CH3. So, that would be a 3-methylbutyl group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-2 group, making it a isoamyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group. That would be a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is a benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Or perhaps X isn't a benzaldehyde but a different compound.

Wait, another thought: If X is a benzyl bromide derivative with a carbonyl group, then substitution would replace Br with I. For example, if X is benzyl bromide with a substituent, maybe the product would be benzyl iodide, but I don’t see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a methyl benzoate or something similar. Then the IR would have the carbonyl, and the NMR would show the ester groups. But the NMR doesn't show any ester peaks, like a triplet for the CH3 in an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cinnamic acid derivative. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which could be an aromatic ring. The 1450 cm-1 is also aromatic.

So, the compound X is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group (likely aldehyde or ketone) and another substituent.

Putting it all together, let me try to imagine the structure of X.

X is a para-substituted benzaldehyde with another group. The substituent is a chain that includes a CH group (2.9 ppm), a CH2 (1.7 ppm), a CH3 (1.4), and a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

So:

Benzaldehyde with a substituent in the para position which is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? But that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, but let's count the substituent's hydrogen.

The substituent has:

- 1H (m at 2.9 ppm): perhaps a CH group.

This CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), which is connected to a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and that CH3 is connected to a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

So, the substituent is: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that would make it a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3). That's a pentyl group, but perhaps it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-2. Then, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)2. But that would be a neopentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group, which is a butyl group, specifically an iso-butyl group.

Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the CH2CH2CH3 group. Then, the substituent must be a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group, which is a pentyl group, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group in position 1 and a methyl in position 4.

But in our case, the substituents are a CHO and another group in para positions. So, that doesn't align with the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, which would fit the NMR peaks.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR.

The substituent's NMR is: 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

Let me try to imagine the structure. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests it's the end of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, it's attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2.

The 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, so perhaps a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to another CH2.

The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 connected to the CH and another CH2.

The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, perhaps a CH connected to two CH2 groups.

So, the structure would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, that's a pentyl group, but that's five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon group.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. That would be three carbons, but the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (CH2CH2CH3), so that would require a fourth carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a substituent. Let me try to draw it.

The substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, that's a butyl group, specifically an iso-butyl group.

Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is iso-butyl.

So, the structure of X is para-substituted benzaldehyde with an iso-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR. The iso-butyl group's protons would be:

The central CH (the one attached to the benzene) would have two CH3 groups attached. But in the NMR, the substituent shows a 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

Wait, an iso-butyl group would have a CH(CH3)2, so the CH would have two CH3 groups attached. The CH would split into a septet, perhaps, but the NMR shows it as a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH. No, maybe it's a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)3CH3 group, which would be a butyl group. But that would give a different NMR pattern.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction is that?

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the substitution of benzyl halides to form benzyl iodides, or for the substitution of allylic halides to form alkenes.

But in this case, if X has a bromide or iodide in a position that can undergo substitution, the product would have iodide in that position.

Looking at the options, options B and D are substituted benzene rings without any functional groups. Option C is a benzoic acid, option A is a propanoic acid derivative.

So, if X has a Br attached to a carbon that is next to a carbonyl group, substitution with iodide would form a new bond. Alternatively, if X is a bromoalkane attached to a benzene ring, substitution would form a bromoiodide, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide (Ph-CH2-Br), and substitution with HI would give Ph-CH2-I. But none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are a sec-butyl group in position 1 and a methyl in position 4. But in X's NMR, the substituent is a single group, not a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the aldehyde group is transformed into a CH2 group.

Wait, but how?

Another thought: Maybe X is a benzaldehyde with a bromide on the adjacent carbon. For example, benzaldehyde with a bromide on the alpha position. Then, treatment with HI and red phosphorus could substitute the bromide with iodide. But then the product would have a CH2I group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. But that would require different reagents, like aqueous acid or base.

Wait, another possibility: The aldehyde group in X is converted into a carboxylic acid upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. But that usually requires different reagents, like NaBH4 or LiAlH4, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, let me think differently. The IR of X shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The aldehyde has a C=O around 1720 cm-1. So, X is a benzaldehyde derivative.

In the NMR, the aldehyde proton is at 10.5 ppm, singlet.

So, X is para-substituted benzaldehyde with another group.

After reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is a substitution reaction, maybe the substituent changes.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a bromide which is replaced by iodide. But in the options, I don't see any iodide products.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide which undergoes substitution to become a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzal bromide, where the substituent is a bromide on a chain. For example, X is 4-(bromopropyl)benzaldehyde. Then, substitution with HI would replace Br with I, giving 4-(iodopropyl)benzaldehyde.

But again, the options don't include such a product.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options.

If the reaction is a substitution, and the product is one of the options, perhaps the starting material is a bromide that substitutes to form one of these.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is a 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, and the reaction converts the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid, perhaps via oxidation, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Alternatively, if X is a 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that doesn't align with the NMR.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a substitution where a leaving group is replaced, leading to a new substituent on the benzene ring.

For example, if X is 4-(bromopropyl)benzaldehyde, substitution would give 4-(iodopropyl)benzaldehyde, but again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbonyl group, like the aldehyde being cleaved to form a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to figure out what the product would be if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has a bromide.

If X is a benzal bromide, perhaps the reaction would substitute the bromide with iodide, leading to a benzal iodide, but none of the options are that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. For example, if X is a benzyl bromide with a neighboring hydrogen, the reaction could eliminate to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

But I don't see any double bonds in the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But the starting material's IR doesn't show an ester peak.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acyl bromide (acid bromide), and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: The substituent in X is a CH2BrCH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, substitution with HI would replace Br with I, giving CH2I CH2 CH(CH3)2. But that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2BrCH(CH3) group. Then substitution would give CH2ICH(CH3), but again, not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should proceed to the conclusion.

Wait, considering the options, if the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the starting material would have been 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. But the reaction would need to oxidize the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzal bromide with a substituent, and the substitution adds an iodide, but I don't see how that forms the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, and the reaction adds a substituent.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions again.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts alkyl halides into alkenes via elimination. So, if X is an allylic bromide, the reaction would form an alkene.

Alternatively, if X is a benzyl bromide, the reaction would form a benzyl iodide.

But none of the options are alkenes or benzyl iodides.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a bromoalkane, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus replaces the bromide with iodide, giving a different substituent.

For example, if X is a 4-(bromoethyl)benzaldehyde, then substitution would give a 4-(iodoethyl)benzaldehyde, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a longer chain that upon substitution becomes a sec-butyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent in X is a bromo group that, after substitution, forms a sec-butyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a CH2BrCH(CH3) group, substitution with HI would yield CH2ICH(CH3). But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2BrCH(CH3), but that's more complicated.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for a more straightforward approach.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, leading to substitution. The starting material has an aldehyde group (from the NMR and IR). The product options include benzoic acids and isobutyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the aldehyde is converted into a carboxylic acid. But I don't think HI and red phosphorus would oxidize an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid. That's usually done with other reagents like KMnO4 or CrO3.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a larger structure that is cleaved. For example, if X is a benzaldehyde with a bromide on the adjacent carbon, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might lead to substitution and elimination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But again, that's not matching the options.

Wait, another angle: The product options include a sec-butyl group. So perhaps the substituent in X is a bromide that upon substitution becomes a sec-butyl iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in X is a bromide, and substitution with HI adds an iodide, but that wouldn't form a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in X is a bromide at the end of a chain, and substitution with HI adds iodide, making the chain longer? No, substitution doesn't add atoms.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent, maybe I'll have to make an educated guess.

Looking back at the NMR, the substituent's peaks suggest a chain with a CH group, CH2, CH3, and a terminal CH2CH3. That looks like a four-carbon chain with a branch, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

So, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then perhaps the product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the reaction would have to convert the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid. But how? Normally, that requires oxidation. But perhaps under these conditions, it's possible.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are not typically oxidizing agents. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a bromide which is substituted, leading to the acid.

I'm not sure, but given the options, I'll go with option C as the product.


Compound X is analyzed based on its IR and NMR data. The IR spectrum shows a strong carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. The aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. Additional peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest a chain attached to the benzene ring, likely a sec-butyl group.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a substitution reaction, typically replacing a halide with iodide. However, the product options provided do not include iodinated compounds. Instead, the reaction may involve the conversion of the aldehyde group into a carboxylic acid. This is consistent with option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which has a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent in the para position.

The IR and NMR data of Compound X align with the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid after the reaction. The aldehyde is converted into a carboxylic acid, and the sec-butyl group remains intact. Therefore, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
