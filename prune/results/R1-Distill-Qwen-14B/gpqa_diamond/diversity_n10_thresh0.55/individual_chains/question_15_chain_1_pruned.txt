Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, so there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, and they've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The masses are the same, so I don't think that comes into play here. But their orbital periods are differentâ€”Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is about 33 days. 

They both have circular orbits, which is helpful because eccentricity could complicate things. The host stars are different in mass but have the same radius. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But since both stars have the same radius, that's interesting. 

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers are choosing the one with the higher probability to observe. The options give different probabilities, so I need to calculate which planet is more probable.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but wait, in this case, the planets are Earth-like, so their sizes are similar. But actually, the probability also depends on the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh right, the transit probability increases when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. 

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some factors, but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The actual probability is more about the geometry of the system. I think the transit probability (P) is given by (R_planet + R_star) / (a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, that's not right. 

Wait, the probability of a transit is approximated by (R_* + R_p) / a, where R_* is the star's radius, R_p the planet's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, actually, the exact formula is (R_star) / (a * sqrt(1 + (M_planet / M_star)^2))), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of orbital geometry.
