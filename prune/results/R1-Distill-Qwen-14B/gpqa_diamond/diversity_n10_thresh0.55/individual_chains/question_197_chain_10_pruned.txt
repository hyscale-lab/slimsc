Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups, maybe like esters or nitriles?

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR peaks given are 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in esters or carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical of an aldehyde proton, but wait, that's usually around 9-10. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is also around 10-12. But since we have a strong O-H in IR, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR had 3400–2500, which is a broad range—hmm, maybe an O-H from an acid or an alcohol. But the 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, so carboxylic acid would have that.

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) look like a para-substituted aromatic ring. If it's para, maybe it's a substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. So like a methyl group and another group in the para.

Then the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to something, maybe an oxygen or a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a branching point. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. Let's see: the 10.5 ppm could be a COOH group. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad peaks, which this is, but the integration is 1H. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde group, but then the IR wouldn't show the O-H. Hmm.

Wait, the IR at 3400-2500 could be an O-H from an alcohol as well. But the 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester? Because esters have carbonyls around 1720-1740 cm-1, and if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak, and the carbonyl around 1700. But in the IR, 1720 suggests ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, but the aromatic signals suggest substitution on the ring.

So perhaps I should sketch a possible structure. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent. The substituent could be a group attached through an oxygen, maybe an ester. So, like para-substituted with an ester group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which might be a CH3 attached to a CH2, maybe as in a -CH2-CO-O- group or something. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Let me think: maybe something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, another approach: The 10.5 ppm (bs) could be the aldehyde proton, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but the IR doesn't show a peak strong enough for a ketone, unless it's conjugated. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider the NMR shifts more carefully. The 10.5 ppm is a singlet, broad. Could that be a carboxylic acid? If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 and the strong carbonyl around 1700. But the IR in the question has
