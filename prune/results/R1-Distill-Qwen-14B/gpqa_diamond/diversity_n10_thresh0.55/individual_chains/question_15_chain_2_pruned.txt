Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to break it down.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_2's star is evolved and has expanded but not increased its mass? Not sure if that's relevant, but I'll note it.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. Wait, the formula for transit probability is something like R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula (R_planet + R_star) / a, but since the planet is much smaller than the star, it's approximately R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to R_*/a. But wait, I think the exact formula is (R_planet + R_star) / a, but if R_planet is much
