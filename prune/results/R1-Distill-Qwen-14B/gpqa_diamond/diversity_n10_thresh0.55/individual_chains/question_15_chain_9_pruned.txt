Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit, given certain conditions. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to detect their transits, but they can only observe one because of limited time. They've already found these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits.

Wait, the host stars' details are important too. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Hmm, same radius but different masses. That probably affects the probability of transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet, the star's size, and the orbital distance. But wait, I'm not sure about all the factors. Let me think. The transit probability (P) is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the orbital distance. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh wait, the formula I recall is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / a) / (R_s / a), no, that's not it. Or maybe the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, but multiplied by something else. 

Wait, I think the probability of transit is given by the formula P = (
