Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the equations.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. They want the maximum speed, v_max. Oh right, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed comes from when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is (1/2) k A², right? Then the max speed would be when potential is zero, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so that answer might not hold.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy. So the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies exchange, but in relativity, that's more complicated.

Wait, but in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is given by E = gamma m c². But how does
