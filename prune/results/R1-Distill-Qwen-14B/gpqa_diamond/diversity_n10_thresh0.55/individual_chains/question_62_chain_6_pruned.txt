Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a synthesis question, which I think involves figuring out the right sequence of reactions to get a specific compound. Let me see what the target molecule is and what the starting material is.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to be a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group, which means there's a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane, and that methyl has both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached. Also, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (CHO) attached, so that's the aldehyde part.

Wait, wait. Let me draw this mentally. The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part suggests that the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (CHO) attached. Then, there's a substituent on the cyclohexane ring at position 1, which is a methyl group. That methyl group is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. So the structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2- something? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

So, I need to figure out the steps to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's think about what transformations are needed.

First, I need to get the aldehyde group. The starting material has a triple bond. Maybe a way to introduce the aldehyde is to do some kind of oxidation or perhaps a hydration followed by oxidation. Alternatively, maybe adding a ketone and then reducing or oxidizing.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is like having a cyclohexyl group attached to a carbon that's triple-bonded to another carbon. So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2... Wait, maybe I should clarify: ethynylcyclohex
