Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by incorporating higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve. But wait, what about the symmetries?

First, let me think about Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT, which is an effective theory built upon it, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz invariant. That means option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Since the Standard Model respects Poincare, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it, the operators in SMEFT should respect Poincare as well. Wait, but waitâ€”operators in SMEFT are written in a way that they transform properly under the Standard Model group and Lorentz symmetry. So maybe they also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are correct?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in SMEFT, the operators are higher-dimensional, but their structure is such that they are consistent with the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry
