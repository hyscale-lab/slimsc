Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, so relativistic effects must come into play here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives v = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, the problem says it's relativistic, so I can't just use the non-relativistic approach.

In relativity, energy includes the rest mass energy, and kinetic energy isn't just ½mv². So I need to think about relativistic energy equations. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. The potential energy in the relativistic case might be different too. But wait, Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx², same as non-relativistic. Or does that change? I'm not sure.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx² regardless of relativity, I think. So the total mechanical energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy
