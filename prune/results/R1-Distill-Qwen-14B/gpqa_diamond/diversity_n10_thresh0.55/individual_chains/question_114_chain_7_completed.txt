Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, reagents are crucial for determining the reaction pathway.

The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So, reacting a ketone with sodium cyanide. I think that's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, normally ketones react with nucleophiles like CN- in a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, but when you have a ketone and you add something like NaCN, which is a source of CN-, under certain conditions. Oh, wait, but if it's in a protic solvent, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed addition. Because usually, addition of nucleophiles to ketones is done in a solvent that can stabilize the transition state, like H3O+ or something that protonates the carbonyl.

So, when you add H3O+ (which is option A or B), the carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then, the CN- can attack. But wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN- under acidic conditions, the product should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me think about the structure. So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense.

So, the first step is an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone. So, reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+.

Now, looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm, why would that be? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I remember that's used for reductions, like in the reduction of ketones to alcohols. Wait, but in this case, it's a nucleophilic addition, not a reduction. So maybe H3O+ is the right choice for A. So A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is a nitrile group attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl group and two other substituents, one of which is a benzyl group attached to a phenyl ring. Wait, or maybe it's a benzyl group attached to another phenyl ring? Not entirely crucial for the reaction, perhaps.

The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile (-CN) group is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the typical reagents for that are either strong oxidizing agents under acidic conditions or maybe hydrolysis with strong acid.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids. The conditions are usually strong acid and heat. Alternatively, they can be hydrolyzed under basic conditions, but that would give a carboxylate, which would then be acidified. But in this problem, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be done under acidic conditions.

Another possibility is using HCl and H2O with some heating. Wait, I think that the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using a strong acid like HCl, along with H2O and heat. Or is it that the reagent is concentrated H2SO4 and heat?

Wait, but in the options, the possible reagents B are HCl or CH3COOH. So, looking at the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So, B is the reagent that's added, along with H2O. Wait, the reaction is: [compound] + B (H2O) → [compound with COOH].

So, the reagent B must facilitate the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Let me think: hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid is typically done under strong acidic or basic conditions. But when using H2O, maybe it's a hydrolysis with an acid catalyst.

Wait, another approach: the nitrile is converted to an amide first, then to a carboxylic acid. But no, in the given reaction, it's a direct conversion. Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is HCl in H2O. Because concentrated HCl can act as a strong acid catalyst. So, B would be HCl.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH. So, which is correct? I think that the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is usually done with HCl and water under reflux, so B would be HCl.

Wait, but sometimes, in some cases, it's done with a weak acid. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think again.

Wait, in the first step, the reagent A is H3O+ (so, HCl or H2SO4 maybe, but in options, it's H3O+ as a reagent). So, for the second reaction, the nitrile to carboxylic acid: the reaction is typically done in acidic conditions, perhaps using HCl as the reagent. So B would be HCl.

Looking back at the options, option A has B as HCl. So, in the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so option A or B), and the second reaction uses HCl as B. So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option B is A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH.

So, which is correct for the second reaction? Let me think: when the nitrile is treated with HCl in H2O, it hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. So, B must be HCl. So, the second reaction uses HCl as reagent B.

Wait, but the problem statement says "B (H2O) →", so maybe the reagent is a combination of H2O and B. So, for the second step, the reagent is B, which is added along with H2O.

So, if B is HCl, that would make the solution acidic, driving the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

Putting it all together, the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl. Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So option A is correct.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the nitrile hydrolysis is done using H2SO4 and heat. But in the options, HCl is an option, so perhaps that's the intended answer.

So the correct option is A. But let me make sure.

Wait, another angle: the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to a ketone. The reagent is H3O+ as A. So, in the first reaction, it's an acid-catalyzed addition, so A is H3O+.

The second reaction is hydrolysis, so B is HCl. So, the correct option is A (A=H3O+, B=HCl).


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the carbonyl group of the ketone reacts with CN⁻. For this reaction to proceed, the carbonyl carbon must be activated, which is achieved by protonating the carbonyl oxygen using an acid. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this step, making A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, and HCl in water is a common reagent for this transformation. Therefore, B = HCl is the appropriate reagent for the second step.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
