Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The question is about distinguishing two quantum states with different energies. The energies are E1 and E2, and each has a certain lifetime. The lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds for the first and 10^-8 seconds for the second. We need to find the energy difference between them that allows us to clearly resolve the two states.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right! The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known, measured, or controlled. Specifically, the principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. 

So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Or maybe I should think about the energy-time uncertainty relation as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. Wait, but sometimes people approximate it without the ½ factor, so perhaps it's roughly ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. I'll have to check that, but for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact factor isn't crucial.

Now, the lifetimes given here are the lifetimes of the states. I think the uncertainty in time Δt here would be related to the lifetime of the state. Because if a state has a short lifetime, it's not around for long, so the time uncertainty is large. Conversely, a longer lifetime means a smaller Δt.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The lifetime τ is the average time the state exists before decaying. So when the lifetime is longer, the state is around longer, so the time uncertainty Δt would be smaller. So for E1, which has τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the Δt1 is roughly 1e-9 s. Similarly, E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 s, so Δt2 is about 1e-8 s.

But wait, some sources say that the uncertainty in the decay time is on the order of the lifetime. So Δt is about τ. So for each state, the uncertainty in their lifetime is approximately their own τ.

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if the lifetime of a state is
