Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question says that iron atoms in star 1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're supposed to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Right, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. Oh wait, the formula is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-Î”E/(k*T)). Or is it the other way around? No, because higher energy levels have lower populations, so the ratio should be the lower divided by higher, but wait, in the question, star 1 has twice as excited, so more in the higher state. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think that means that the population in the excited state is higher in star 1.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the two energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. Then the population ratio n(E2)/n(E1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(
