Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. 

Wait, I remember that when you have a metal ion like Co(II) and a ligand like SCN-, they form complexes. The stability constants, beta, indicate how stable each complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. 

The problem gives the stability constants beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. So the complexes must be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)2]^, [Co(SCN)3]^{2+}, and [Co(SCN)4]^{3-} respectively. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the beta values are given as beta1 to beta4. So each beta corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ions, right? So beta1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), beta2 is for Co(SCN)2^-, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Oh, right, dithiocyanato would be [Co(SCN)_2]^-. So that's the second complex, which has a beta2 of 40. But wait, I think I might be mixing up the terms. Wait, wait, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ (monothiocyanate), the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^+ - no wait, maybe the charges are different. Let me think: Co(II) is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So for each complex:

n = 1: Co(SCN) → charge is +2 -1 = +1. So formula is [Co(SCN)]^+.

n=2: Co(SCN)_2 → +2 -2 = 0 → neutral complex?

Wait, wait, wait, maybe I should think about the charge on the complex. For n=1, it's [Co(SCN)]^+ because the metal is +2, minus one SCN- gives +1 charge. For n=2, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^{–1}, and for n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^{–2}.

So the stability constants are beta
