Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator called Ay. 

Let me read the problem again. So, the intrinsic angular momentum operator A's Y-component is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The equation given is Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. 

The matrix S has first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, writing that out, S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. So first, I should probably write down what Ay looks like.

Let me compute that. Each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay matrix is:

[ 0 * c   (-i) * c ]
[ i * c    0 * c ]

So, substituting c = h/(4π), each element becomes:

0, (-i h)/(4π), (i h)/(4π), 0.

So,

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
        [(i h)/(4π), 0] ]

Hmm. Now, to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. I remember that for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]], the eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - λ I would be:

[ -λ       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π) ) ].

Calculating determinant:

λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) )( h²/(4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute that product: (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. Because i * (-i) = -(i^2) = -(-1)=1.

So, the product is (1)*(h²/(16 π²)) = h²/(16 π²).

So, determinant equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Thus, λ² = h²/(16 π²), so λ = ± h/(4 π) * (1/4) * ... Wait, wait, no. Let me compute the square root. 

h squared over 16 pi squared is (h/(4 pi))². So, λ² = (h/(4 pi))² → λ = h/(4 pi) and λ = -h/(4 pi). 

Wait, no. Wait, when I take the square root, I get λ = ± h/(4 pi) * (1/2) ? No, wait, let me think. Because h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4 pi))², so the square root gives h/(4 pi). So, λ is ± h/(4 pi). 

Wait, but wait, no, because (h/(4 pi)) squared is h²/(16 pi²), so square root is h/(4 pi), correct. So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4 pi). 

So looking at the options. Let's look at the options one by one. 

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense. Because the eigenvalues I found are real numbers, right? Because the matrix is Hermitian? Wait, is Ay Hermitian? Because for angular momentum operators, they're Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. Let me check. 

The matrix Ay is given as c times S, where S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute the
