Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says: Consider the density matrix ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). What is its geometrical position in the qubits space? The options are A to D, each with different r values.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states. A pure state is a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and it has a trace of 1. But when you have a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture, so the density matrix is a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, the given ρ looks like it's a combination of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Each of those is a projector, right? So ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. That would mean it's a mixed state of the two basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability. So this is a classical mixture, not a quantum superposition.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on what that exactly refers to. I think in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a vector in 3D space. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r is such that the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me think. The general form for a density matrix of a qubit in the Bloch sphere is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, where r_x, r_y, r_z are the components of the Bloch vector r, and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, let's compute what that would be in terms of the Bloch vector.

First, I'll expand |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. The standard basis states are |0⟩ = [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ = [0, 1]^T. So |0⟩⟨0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0
