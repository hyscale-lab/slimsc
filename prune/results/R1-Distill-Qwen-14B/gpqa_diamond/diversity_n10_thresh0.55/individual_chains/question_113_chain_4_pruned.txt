Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and then start breaking it down.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and it's been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which I remember usually corresponds to O-H stretching. Like, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is acidic and easily dissociates.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which might be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with something else. Or wait, maybe it's an absorption from a double bond, like a C=C. Wait, but another thought: sometimes in esters or ketones, there's a peak around 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe a C=C stretch. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, like in an aromatic ester or something.

Looking at the NMR: the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so the compound probably has an alkene group. So maybe a diene or an enol structure or something with a double bond adjacent to an oxygen.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Wait, what fragments give 45? Well, maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2O fragment, which is 45 (since CH3 is 15, so (15*2)+(16) = 46? Wait, no, (CH3)2O would be 15*2 +16=46. So that's not 45. So maybe another group. Oh, maybe a CH2O group? Wait, CH2O is 30. Or perhaps a propionyl group? Wait, maybe a formyl group. Or, wait, 45 could be a propyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone or an aldehyde. Or perhaps a carbonyl group. Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight for CH3COOH (which is 60, wait no, that's 60. No, wait 45 is maybe (CH3)2O... no, that's 46. Hmm, another possibility: 45 could be CH2O something, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, maybe it's from a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that's 44, I think.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the possible formulas have varying degrees of unsaturation.

Let me think about degrees of unsaturation. The formula for each option:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here
