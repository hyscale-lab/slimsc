Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts involved, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that there's a diatomic molecule made up of elements X and Y. They can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the same as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that should be absorbed so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall what the quantum rotation-vibration model entails. I remember that for diatomic molecules, their vibrational and rotational energy levels are quantized, and these two motions are usually considered separately. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both the rotation and vibration modes.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so that affects the rotational energy levels. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe I don't need to get too deep into that. The question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it and transitions to the next state.

So, the molecule is initially in the fundamental state. The next state would be the one with the next higher energy. Since it's a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. But wait, if it's in the fundamental state, that's the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational change.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's the smallest possible energy increase. That suggests it's the smallest possible photon energy needed. So maybe it's a pure vibrational transition, since rotational transitions typically require lower energy than vibrational. Or wait, no, because the rotational energy levels are quantized and require specific conditions for transitions.

Wait, but wait. Photons are absorbed in transitions between energy states. The energy of a photon must match the energy difference between the two states. So if the molecule is in its ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state would be either v=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). But which requires a lower energy photon?

Let me think about the energy levels. Vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational ones. The energy spacing between rotational levels is E
