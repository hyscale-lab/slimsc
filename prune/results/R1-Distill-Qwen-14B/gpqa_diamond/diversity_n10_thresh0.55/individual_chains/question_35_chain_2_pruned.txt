Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I need to figure out which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator Ay. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which equals c multiplied by S. Here, c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, the matrix S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, right, so the operator Ay would be c times this S matrix. Let me compute that. Since c = h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by c gives:

Ay = c * S = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), that becomes:

Ay = [ [0, -i (h/(4π)) ],
        [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So, the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ [ -a , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, what's (-i)(i)? Well, i times i is -1, so (-i)*i is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1)(h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So solving for a: a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, let me compute that again. Wait, h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4π))². So square-rooting gives ± (h/(4π)) * sqrt(1) → a = ± h/(4π) * 1? No, wait, no. Wait, h/(4π) is c, right? So the equation is a² = c² → a = ± c. So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, let me check if Ay is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Let's see: Ay is c times S. Is S Hermitian? The conjugate transpose of S is swapping the off-diagonal elements and taking their complex conjugates. The original S is:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

The conjugate transpose would be [0, i; -i
