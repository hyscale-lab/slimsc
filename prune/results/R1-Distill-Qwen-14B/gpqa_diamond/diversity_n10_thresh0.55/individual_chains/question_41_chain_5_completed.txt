Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I think I remember something about how light speed doesn't change in different inertial frames according to special relativity, but wait, this is about a medium moving relative to the observer. Let me try to break this down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. I need to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is usually c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So in the glass, when it's at rest, the speed is v_light = c/n. But now the glass is moving... does that affect the speed of light in it?

I think this relates to the Doppler effect or maybe the addition of velocities in relativity. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light is moving at v_light = c/n in the glass's frame. But from the lab's perspective, how does that add?

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame. So u would be (c/n) in the direction of motion.

Wait, so the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab's frame, the light's velocity would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame. But how does this work with relativity?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since light's speed is always c in any inertial frame, perhaps this isn't the case here. Wait, no, because the medium is moving, so the speed of light in the medium isn't c. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think this is a scenario where the medium is moving, so perhaps the speed as observed in the lab frame is different. Let me think again. When the medium is moving, does the speed of light within it change according to the lab frame?

I recall that in the case of a medium moving with velocity v relative to the lab, the speed of light inside the medium is still c/n, but the direction might change due to the motion. Wait, but in the lab frame, the light's speed shouldn't exceed c. So perhaps the speed is (c/n) + v, but that's if the velocities add linearly, which they don't in relativity.

Wait, but if the glass is moving towards me (the observer) and the light is moving in the same direction (towards me), then the velocity addition formula would apply. So according to the lab frame, the speed of the light is u'.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's consider the glass's frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. The glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of the light in the lab frame would be (v_light + v) / (1 + (v_light * v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, v_light is c/n. Let me substitute that in.

So u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator:

1 + (v c )/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

Wait, but c=1 in the problem, so that becomes 1 + v/(n)

So u = [ (1/n) + v ] / [1 + v/(n) ]

Hmm, let's factor out 1/(n) from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: [ (1 + n v ) ] / n

Denominator: [ (n + v ) ] / n

So when we divide them, the n's cancel out. So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, that's option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

But wait a second, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of the light in the lab would be higher than c/n?

Wait, but wait, that can't be, because in relativity, nothing can exceed c. Let me check the expression I got: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, if v is positive, say, moving towards the observer, then n must be greater than 1. Let's plug in some numbers. Let's say n=1 (vacuum?), but no, n=1 is vacuum, so glass would have n>1.

Wait, let's take n=2 and v=0.5 (in units where c=1). Then the numerator is 1 + 2*0.5 = 2. Denominator is 2+0.5=2.5. So u= 2 / 2.5 = 0.8. Which is less than 1, so acceptable.

Wait another example: v approaches 1. Let's say v = 0.99, n=2.

Numerator: 1 + 2*0.99 = 2.98

Denominator: 2 + 0.99=2.99

So u=2.98/2.99≈0.9966, which is less than 1. So that seems okay.

But wait, if the glass is moving towards the observer (v positive), and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, meaning same direction as v. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher than (c/n). Because the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

Wait, but according to the formula I derived, u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, let me think if that makes sense. Suppose v is positive, so the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in that same direction. So the light in the lab frame would have a speed higher than c/n. So the glass is giving the light an additional boost.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign conventions. Because in the lab frame, if the glass is moving towards me, then in the glass's frame, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, maybe I should think about direction. Let’s say the positive direction is towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the positive direction. The light, in the glass's frame, is also moving positive. So when adding velocities, the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c² )

Wait, but in this case, u in the glass frame is c/n, so u = 1/n (since c=1). So u' = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v )

Which is same as the expression I had earlier, (1 + n v)/(n + v )

So that would make the speed in the lab frame u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Looking back at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light propagates through the glass with a refractive index \( n \). The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is \( c/n \) (or \( 1/n \) since \( c = 1 \)).

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u \) is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame (\( u = 1/n \)) and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( u = 1/n \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This expression represents the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory. Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option A: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
