Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, so I need to find which power makes sense.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. Right, because parallax formula is d = 1/plx.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number of stars in a given volume of space is the same everywhere. Oh wait, wait, but since the distribution is uniform, the number density (stars per unit volume) is a constant, let's call it n.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So let me think in terms of parallax and how that relates to volume.

Parallax plx is a measure of distance. So, when plx increases, the distance decreases because plx = 1/d. So, a larger plx means the star is closer to us.

I need to find how the number of stars per unit change in plx (like dN/dplx) depends on plx. So, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx and then see how the number of stars relates to that.

Wait, but the distribution is uniform in the sky, which I think refers to a uniform number density in space. So, the number of stars in a small volume element dV would be n * dV.

But what's dV in terms of parallax? Let's think in cylindrical coordinates or something. Because the stars are in all directions, maybe it's better to model this in spherical shells.

Wait, but parallax relates to distance. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. For a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? That would be from d = 1/plx to
