Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson X. Let me see what I remember from my studies. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and tells me the mass of the boson. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Hmm.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think the notation here is a bit tricky. Oh right, the interaction term would typically involve the field X coupling to fermions. So the structure is probably something like ψ† X ψ or similar. But in any case, the key here is that X is interacting with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when considering decay products, each product's rest mass must be less than half the mass of X, because in decay, the maximum energy for each particle would be when they are at rest relative to each other, so each must be less than M_X/2.

Wait, no, wait. The mass of each fermion in the decay product must be less than M_X/2. Because for a boson at rest decaying into two particles, the maximum mass each can have is when they are produced at rest, meaning their combined rest mass is M_X. So each must be less than M_X/2. Oh wait, actually, each must be less than or equal to M_X/2. Because if the mass is exactly M_X/2, they can be produced but with zero kinetic energy.

So first, I need to list all possible fermions that have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV). Because any fermion with a mass higher than 3 GeV can't be a decay product.

What are the known fermion masses? Let me think:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Quarks: up, down (u,d) ~ very light, maybe a few MeV each. But in reality, their masses are around a few MeV (u ~ 2.2 MeV, d ~4.7 MeV). But I think in the Standard Model, the current masses are u ~ 2.2 MeV, d ~4.7 MeV, s ~95 MeV, c ~1.27 GeV, s ~95 MeV, etc.

Wait, so the current masses for quarks are: up and down are around a few MeV, strange is about 100 MeV, charm is around 1.3 GeV, bottom (beauty) is around 4.5 GeV, and top is about 173 GeV. Wait, wait, no, I think bottom is about 4.7 GeV, top is 173 GeV.

Wait, let me check in my mind. The top is the heaviest, around 173 GeV. Bottom is roughly 4.7 GeV. Charm is about 1.27 GeV. Strange is about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV). Up and down are around a few MeV (so negligible compared to
