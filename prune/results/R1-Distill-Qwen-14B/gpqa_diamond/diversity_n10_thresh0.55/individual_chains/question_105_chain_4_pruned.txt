Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again. The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how its brightness variations compare to those caused by an exoplanet. I remember that stars with spots can sometimes mimic the signals we look for when detecting exoplanets, like the transit method. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, so I'll have to think this through.

Alright, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. The star has dark spots covering one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots, right? So 20% coverage on one hemisphere... or wait, no, it's one hemisphere that's covered 20%? Or is the entire star covered 20%? Hmm, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, wait, I think the filling factor refers to the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 20% covered, that's the spot coverage in that hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. The star's brightness variations are due to rotation, and the spots moving in and out of view. But if the same amplitude in the light curve is produced by a planet, what's the planet's radius relative to the star?

The key here is to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and then equate that to the amplitude caused by a planet transit.

Wait
