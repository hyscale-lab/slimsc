Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and it's about finding the eigenvector of a specific operator. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the operator is denoted as P, and it's a vector operator, meaning it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The question asks about the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n that's in the x-z plane. So n is in the x-z plane, which probably means its y-component is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z) or something like that.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's related to angular momentum. Oh wait, yes, in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices represent the spin operators for spin-1/2 particles. So P is probably the spin operator, like σ/2 multiplied by ħ. Because the components given are similar to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Looking at the given components:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix.

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]. Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P is the spin operator for a muon, which has spin 1/2. So the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2, which matches the question.

The problem is asking for the eigenvector of vector P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, the operator is along n, so it's P · n. So the operator is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

Wait, but the question says the operator is P along n. So the operator is P · n, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0, so it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the operator itself is P, but the eigenvalue is for the component along n. So perhaps the operator we need to find
