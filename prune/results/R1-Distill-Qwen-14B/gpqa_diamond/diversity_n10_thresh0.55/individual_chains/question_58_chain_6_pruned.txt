Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the theories listed never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are infinities that pop up in calculations which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method to make the math finite, and then you remove it later, hopefully getting a finite result. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or don't have these infinities.

So the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory of gravity, right? It's a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. I remember that in string theory, the concept of 't Hooft and Veltman's work is different because strings have a natural cutoff scale related to their length. Or wait, maybe it's because string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Or perhaps because it's a theory that, in higher dimensions, has different divergence structures. So maybe it doesn't require regularization because it's inherently finite when considering all the stringy effects. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe superstring theory handles things like UV divergences because the underlying structure is different, so regularization isn't needed. Or perhaps it does require it, but the options are about which doesn't need it.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. Wait, but that's about the strength of the interaction. Now, regularization—does QCD require it? Well, in perturbative calculations, you often get divergences, so you need to regularize them. For example, when calculating loop diagrams, you have to renormalize, which involves regularization. So QCD must require regularization. So option B is not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (Q
