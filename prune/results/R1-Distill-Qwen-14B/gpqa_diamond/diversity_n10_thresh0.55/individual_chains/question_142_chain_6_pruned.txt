Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure states and mixed states. Pure states can be represented by a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, whereas mixed states are statistical ensembles of pure states, leading to a density matrix that's a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, so in this case, we're looking at something that's a combination of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Both of those are projectors, right? And each has a coefficient of 1/2. So this would represent a mixed state where the qubit is in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and |1⟩ with probability 1/2. Because the density matrix is the average of those two projectors, each weighted equally.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. The options are given as points in 3D coordinates, like r=(0,0,1), etc. I remember that the space of qubit density matrices is three-dimensional, which makes sense because a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix has four entries, but due to the constraints (trace=1, Hermitian, positive semi-definite), it's a three-dimensional space.

But wait, how do these density matrices correspond to points in 3D space? Oh right, the Bloch sphere! The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For pure states, a point on the unit sphere in 3D corresponds to the state. But wait, pure states are |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which in the Bloch sphere are points on the surface, like the north pole for |0⟩ and south pole for |1⟩.

But this is a mixed state, so it's a statistical mixture. For a mixed state, especially when it's a completely mixed state, where
