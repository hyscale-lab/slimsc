Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and it's about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking a beta position in a conjugated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out what the major products are for each, and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is the acceptor, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

In a Michael addition, the enolate (from the donor) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. Dimethyl malonate, when deprotonated by NaOEt, forms an enolate. The enolate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Since the acrylate is in the E configuration, the substituents are opposite, but the attack would occur at the more substituted carbon.

So when the enolate attacks the acceptor, it would add across the double bond. The product would form a new carbon-carbon bond. Since both are esters, I think the product would have both ester groups. Let's consider the structure:

The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3-position, so maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the 3 position. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Let me clarify. The acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOCH3. If the substituent is at the 3-position, that's the second carbon of the acrylate. So it's CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but in E configuration. No, wait, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so the 3-position would be the CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOCH3, but that seems off. Maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3. So, it would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The (E) configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides. The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the 3 position. So that would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? No, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No,
