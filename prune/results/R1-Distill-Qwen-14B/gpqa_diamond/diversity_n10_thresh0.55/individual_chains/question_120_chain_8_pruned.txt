Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is something like distance equals 1 over parallax, but wait, I think it's inverse or something. Yeah, parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance in some unit? Or wait, no, I think the formula is d = 1 / plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. So if the parallax is smaller, the star is further away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed implies that the number of stars in a given volume is constant. Wait, but how does that translate to the number per unit of parallax?

So we're looking for N (number of stars) per unit parallax (plx). Wait, no, the question says the number of stars per unit range of plx. So like, how many stars are there in a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, multiplied by something. Or maybe it's the differential number per unit plx.

So since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant, let's call it n. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV.

But how does that relate to parallax? Parallax depends on distance. So if I can express the volume as a function of parallax, maybe I can find how the number of stars depends on plx.

Let me think. If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d from us, with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference for r and r+dr is roughly 4πr² dr.

Now, the parallax plx is related to d. Parallax plx = 1/d (since d is in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to d.

Wait, d = 1/(plx), so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Because if d = 1/plx
