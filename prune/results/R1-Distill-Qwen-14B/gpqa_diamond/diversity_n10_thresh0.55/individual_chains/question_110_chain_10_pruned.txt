Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both these instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. The question gives me some details about each star and the magnitude limits of the telescopes.

Let me read the question again. The task is to find which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, but HIRES can see a bit brighter (down to 16). So, a star must have an apparent magnitude (V) less than or equal to 16 because both can detect up to their limits. Wait, no, wait. No, because each can detect up to their own limits. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be brighter than the higher of the two limits. Wait, no, because if a star is, say, 16.5 mag, then HIRES can see it (since 16.5>16?), wait no. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star's V magnitude is brighter (like lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16. So a star with V=16.5 is fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it. Wait, the notation here is a bit tricky. Magnitudes are such that lower numbers are brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So for ESPRESSO, any star with V <17 can be observed. For HIRES, anything with V <16 can be observed. So a star must have V <16 to be visible by both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16. So the star must be brighter than 16 mag in V.

Wait, no. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The way the question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, "brighter than 17" would mean that the V magnitude is less than 17, because lower
