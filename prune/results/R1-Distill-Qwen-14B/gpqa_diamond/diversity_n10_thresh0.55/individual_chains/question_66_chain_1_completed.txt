Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries? Let's start by recalling each term.

Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, so I'd expect SMEFT operators to as well. Because if they didn't, that would mean the theory is not consistent with relativity, right? So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is probably a must.

Poincare symmetry: That's the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, meaning the theory is invariant under the Poincare group. Wait, but wait—the Poincare group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations, which is like saying the theory looks the same everywhere (translation) and under relativity transformations. So isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz? If the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is the reverse: if all operators respect Lorentz, do they respect Poincare? Or is Poincare a separate condition?

Wait, SMEFT is built as an effective theory of the SM, which itself respects Poincare symmetry. So, effective theories typically inherit the symmetries of the underlying theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, are there cases where they might not? Or is Poincare symmetry automatically maintained if Lorentz and translation symmetries are?

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. But what about Poincare? Since the SM is Poincare-invariant, the SMEFT should also respect this. Because if the operators don't respect Poincare, then the theory would not be consistent with the SM's symmetries.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. The SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, so the effective theory must also respect all the symmetries of the SM. Therefore, SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. So operators must be Poincare-invariant, which would mean option 2 is correct as well.

But wait, the question is which symmetries "must be respected by all operators". So, if an operator violates Poincare symmetry, it wouldn't be part of SMEFT? Or do operators respect Poincare automatically because they're part of a Poincare-invariant theory?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the structure of the operators. SMEFT operators are local, renormalizable? No, they're non-renormalizable, higher-dimensional. But they are constructed to fit into the SM's renormalizable structure, respecting the same symmetries. So yes, the operators must be Poincare-invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. Wait, but wait—Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But does the SMEFT respect both? Or is it that SMEFT respects Lorentz, which is a part of Poincare.

Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars. But what about Poincare? Poincare includes translations, which are generated by the momentum, implying that the theory is the same everywhere. Since SMEFT is a field theory, which is local, and the operators are built from fields and derivatives, which commute with translations, so yes, the operators would respect translation symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

But wait, the question lists Poincare as option 2. So if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer would include them. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. What about the other symmetries like C, P, T, and their combinations? The question includes options 3 and 4.

Option 3 is CP symmetry. Option 4 is CPT symmetry.

In the Standard Model, the SM is not CP symmetric. For instance, the CKM matrix is not diagonal, leading to CP violation. So the SM doesn't respect CP. Hence, SMEFT, which is an extension, may or may not respect CP symmetry. But the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators".

So, operators in SMEFT don't have to be CP-symmetric. For example, in the SM, the Higgs potential is symmetric under CP? Or not. Wait, the Higgs potential is V=μ² |H|² + λ |H|^4. If μ² is real, the potential is CP symmetric. But in the SM, the Higgs gets a VEV, which breaks the symmetry. But I'm getting off track.

The point is, the SM doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry, so SMEFT operators don't have to either. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz-invariant must respect CPT symmetry. Because the combination of C, P, and T transformations must leave the theory invariant due to the properties of the Lorentz group. So, if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it must be CPT invariant.

So, all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry because they respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 4 is a must.

Putting this together, the symmetries that must be respected are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry — yes.

2. Poincare symmetry — yes, because SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory.

4. CPT symmetry — yes.

Wait, but wait. Are all operators in SMEFT required to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetries of the effective theory. So yes, the theory must respect it, so all operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but let's think about the structure of the operators. For example, operators in SMEFT are built from the SM fields and higher-order terms, but they must be Lorentz scalars. So they automatically respect Lorentz, but do they respect Poincare as a whole?

Poincare includes not just Lorentz but also translation. Translation invariance implies that the theory is the same everywhere, so the Lagrangian is invariant under x -> x + a (for some constant a). But each term in the Lagrangian must have the same transformation behavior. Since the operators are local, and the derivatives (which generate translations) act on the fields, the terms in the Lagrangian are translation-invariant.

So yes, all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

So, which options are correct? 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 3 (CP symmetry) is not needed. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

So the correct answer would have 1,2,4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

Wait, but I thought that SMEFT must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3). So the correct answer would include 1,2,4. So option C is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz. So if all operators respect Poincare symmetry, they automatically respect Lorentz. So why are both 1 and 2 included in the options? Because the question is asking which symmetries must be respected, and both are required. Or do they mean that, for example, Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it doesn't need to separately respect Lorentz?

But the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected. So both Poincare and Lorentz, because Poincare is a separate symmetry that includes Lorentz and translation. So yes, the operators must respect both.

Wait, but wait. No, Poincare is a group comprising Lorentz and translation. So if the operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So, if operators respect Poincare, they don't need to separately respect Lorentz? Or the question is asking which symmetries are required regardless of others. But in practice, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, because the SM is Poincare-invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory of the SM. So all operators must respect both.

So, going back, the correct symmetries to choose are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Does the SMEFT necessarily require CPT symmetry? Because, as I thought earlier, any Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-invariant. But wait, is that true?

I remember that in quantum field theory, the combination of C, P, and T transformations must be a symmetry if the theory is Lorentz-invariant. This comes from the fact that the Lorentz group includes transformations that change the orientation of space and time in ways that require CPT to be a symmetry. So yes, if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry.

So, since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer includes 1,2,4. That is option C.

But wait, let me double-check. Because the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators" in SMEFT.

So, all operators must be Poincare-invariant, Lorentz-invariant, and CPT-invariant. So, 1,2,4 are correct. So option C is the answer.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the symmetries listed in the question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, as it is constructed as an effective field theory of the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. All operators in SMEFT are Lorentz scalars, meaning Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a field theory and its operators are local and translation-invariant, it respects Poincaré symmetry. This symmetry is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is respected, but it is explicitly required for the consistency of the theory.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators. The SM already violates CP symmetry (e.g., through the CKM matrix), and SMEFT inherits this property. Therefore, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Any Lorentz-invariant theory, including SMEFT, must respect CPT symmetry due to the properties of the Lorentz group. Thus, CPT symmetry is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is respected.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz Symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré Symmetry (2)**, and **CPT Symmetry (4)**. CP Symmetry (3) is not a requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
