Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. The area calculation probably involves some integration over the surface.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, is it a 2D surface or part of a higher-dimensional manifold?

Looking at the metric, it's in terms of dx² and dy², so maybe it's a 2-dimensional space here. The metric has a denominator (4 - x² - y²), which suggests that when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So that would be the edge of the allowed region. So the radius here might be related to this 2.

Wait, the radius given is r=2. Oh, so the denominator is (4 - x² - y²) = (2² - (x² + y²)). That makes sense because for a pseudosphere (which is like a hyperbolic plane), the radius of curvature is related to the Ricci scalar or something like that.

So, the area of a pseudosphere... Wait, but wait, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the surface extends infinitely. Like, the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite. But wait, maybe the question is about a specific part of it, like a sphere with a certain radius?

Wait, no, the pseudosphere as a surface has infinite area. Because as you go away from the center, the circumference increases exponentially, so the area can't converge. So if the question is about the entire pseudosphere, the area would be infinite.

But wait, the options given are A) 0, B) 4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x²−y²), D) +infty. So D is +infty. So would the area be infinite?

But wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The term pseudosphere sometimes refers to a finite surface with a cusp, like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature but is finite in extent. Wait, but that's more like a sphere in hyperbolic space but with finite area. Or is that something else?

Alternatively, maybe the metric given here represents a finite surface. Let me check the metric. The denominator (4 - x² - y²) implies that x² + y² <4, so the radius of the allowed region is 2. So the space described by this metric is a 2D surface that's like a disk of radius 2, but with a hyperbolic geometry because the curvature is negative.

Wait, no, in 2D, a metric like this might represent a space with constant negative curvature. The standard metric for a hyperbolic plane is usually written in terms of a radius a, and the metric has a term like (dx² + dy²)/(a²(1 - (r²/a²))²), where r is the radial coordinate. But in this case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/4), where r is the radial coordinate in 2D. So a=2, which would make sense for the radius.

So in this metric, the surface is a hyperbolic plane with radius a=2. But wait, the hyperbolic plane is an infinite surface. Even though the radial coordinate is limited to r <2, does that mean that it's a finite region? Wait, no, because the metric's denominator approaches zero as r approaches 2, so the area might be finite.

Wait, let me think about the area. The area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) d²σ. The metric here is diagonal with each component being [32/(4 - x² - y²)], so the determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², where r²=x²+y². So sqrt(det g) would be [32/(4 - r²)]. But wait, the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) dr dθ, in polar coordinates.

Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy²) dx dy. Since g_xy is zero here, it's sqrt(g_xx g_yy) dx dy. So that's [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So the area of the entire surface (the hyperbolic plane of radius 2) would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4. Wait, but wait, when you integrate over r from 0 to 2, the integrand is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, but that integral from r=0 to r=2 would have a problem because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, leading to divergence. So the area is infinite. Hmm, but in reality, the hyperbolic plane's area is infinite. So the pseudosphere here, being the entire hyperbolic plane, would have infinite area.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the metric given is not the entire hyperbolic plane but a part of it, like a pseudosphere of a certain radius. Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." So maybe we're considering a specific radius, like a sphere with a certain area.

Wait, in Euclidean space, the area of a sphere is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a 2-sphere, but in hyperbolic space, so the area would differ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to compute the area. So the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

Compute the integral:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r dr.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] (-du/2) from u=4 to u=0. Which is the same as ∫ [32/(u)] (du/2) from u=0 to u=4. Because flipping the limits removes the negative.

So that's (32/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4. That's 16 [ln u] from 0 to4.

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite.

So the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty.


The metric provided is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature. The denominator \((4 - x^2 - y^2)\) indicates that the surface is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a radius of 2. This metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which is an infinite surface with constant negative curvature.

To calculate the area, the area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, \(\sqrt{\det g} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then computed by integrating over the entire allowed region (\(r \in [0, 2)\), \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\)):

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\) simplifies the problem to evaluating the radial integral:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = 2\pi \cdot 16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 32\pi \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 32\pi (\ln 4 - \ln 0).
\]

As \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the area of the surface is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the hyperbolic plane, represented by this metric, is an infinite surface.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
