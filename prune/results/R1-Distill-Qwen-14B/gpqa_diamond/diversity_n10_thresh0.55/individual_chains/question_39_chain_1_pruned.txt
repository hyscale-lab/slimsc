Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm. The question is about a wave function and finding the normalization constant 'a'. Right, normalization is when the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Alright, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that doesn't look right. Usually, wave functions are either real or complex, but here it's written as a combination. Oh wait, maybe I should write it as a complex number. Let me see: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because in standard wave functions, you can have a complex part, but I think I might have misunderstood the expression. Let me re-express it properly. Oh, perhaps it's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * (1 - 0.5i), but that's not what's written. Wait, the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So it's a real term plus an imaginary term. Like, ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is -0.5.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Usually, the wave function is either real or has a complex coefficient multiplied by some real function. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given expression. So, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would make it a complex function with a real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5. But that can't be right because then the wave function would have a constant imaginary part, which might not fit into the standard form. Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The problem states: the wave function can be described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, perhaps it's a product? Like, [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ] multiplied by (1 - 0.5i). That would make more sense because then both the
