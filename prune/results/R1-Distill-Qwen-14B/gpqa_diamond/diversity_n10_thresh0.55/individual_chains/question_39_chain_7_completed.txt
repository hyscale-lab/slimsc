Okay, so I've got this problem about wave functions and particles in a tube. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that each particle is described by a wave function psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region because that's where the particles aren't found.

Wait, no, actually, the wave function squared gives the probability density. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function itself might not necessarily be zero outside a certain region if it's a bound state or something. Oh wait, no, in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That implies that the wave function must be zero outside of this interval. Because the probability of finding the particle elsewhere is zero, so the square of the wave function (the probability density) must be zero there.

So, the wave function should be zero for x <1 and x>3. Let me look at the given function: psi(x) = (a / sqrt(1 +x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but the question says that the wave function is zero outside, so for x <1 and x>3, psi(x) must be zero. 

Wait, but wait, the way the wave function is written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit odd. Because for real functions, the real and imaginary parts should come from the solution. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is only valid in the region where x is between 1 and 3. But the problem says that the wave function is given as that expression, and when you measure, the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval.

So, for x <1, let's set psi(x) to zero. So, for x <1, (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i = 0. That would imply that a/sqrt(1+x) is equal to 0.5i. But wait, a is a real constant, right? Because it's a coefficient in the wave function, and in quantum mechanics, wave functions can have complex parts, but the coefficients are usually real unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but wait, the term (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real, because a is real and sqrt(1+x) is real for x >=-1. The other term is -0.5i, which is purely imaginary. So adding a real and an imaginary number can't be zero unless both parts are zero. But for x <1, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So setting the sum to zero would require both a/sqrt(1+x) = 0 and -0.5i =0, which is impossible. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is given as a sum of a real and imaginary part, and it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. But for x outside that region, the wave function must be zero. So for x <1 or x>3, the entire expression must equal zero.

Wait, for x <1, let's plug in x=0, for example. That would give (a / sqrt(1)) -0.5i = a -0.5i. For this to be zero, a must be 0.5i. But a is a real number, so that can't be. So that suggests that the wave function as given can't be zero for x<1 unless a is a complex number, but that doesn't make sense because a is given as a real coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the wave function is valid only for x between 1 and 3, and is zero elsewhere. But the problem says that the wave function is as given, and particles are found only between 1 and 3, so the wave function must be zero outside.

Hmm, maybe the given wave function is a part of a larger function that's zero outside. But how? Alternatively, perhaps I need to find a such that the wave function is normalizable, and the normalization condition will help me find a.

Wait, normalization. The integral of the probability density |psi(x)|^2 from -infinity to infinity must equal 1. But since the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, the integral is just from 1 to 3.

So |psi(x)|^2 is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i ] [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i ].

Multiplying these gives (a^2)/(1+x) + i*(a/(1+x)) *0.5 -i*(a/(1+x))*0.5 + (0.5i)^2. Wait, but the imaginary terms cancel. Then, (a^2)/(1+x) + ( -0.25 ), because (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(i^2) = -0.25.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute that again.

The product is [a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i] multiplied by [a/sqrt(1+x) +0.5i].

Using (c - di)(c + di) = c^2 + d^2.

So c is a/sqrt(1+x), and d is 0.5.

So the product is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because (0.5i)^2 is -0.25, but when you multiply (c - di)(c + di) = c² + d².

Ah, right. So the probability density is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 = a^2/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that would mean that the integral of |psi|^2 is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Wait, but the wave function must be normalized to 1. So integrating this from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

So the integral is:

Integral (1 to3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Let me compute that.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral [0.25] dx.

The first integral is a² * ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to 3. The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So, the total integral is a² [ln(3+1) - ln(1+1)] + 0.5 = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] +0.5.

Simplify ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set this equal to 1 for normalization:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute a:

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, that's option B: 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we analyze the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The problem states that particles are only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), implying the wave function must be zero outside this interval. However, the wave function as given cannot be zero for \( x < 1 \) or \( x > 3 \) because it consists of a real term \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\) and an imaginary term \(-0.5i\), which cannot cancel each other out. This suggests the wave function is valid only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and the wave function is zero elsewhere.

To normalize the wave function, we compute the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\right)\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i\right) = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. Compute the first integral:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. Compute the second integral:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combine the results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
