Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. From what I understand, when X reacts with Y, it releases a gas W, forms a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius. That might help me figure out what B is.

The problem also mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm. So X has an element with a heavy isotope. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Oh wait, I remember that heavy isotopes are sometimes used in things like isotopic labeling. But more importantly, thinking about reagents, maybe X is something like a heavy water isotope? Or perhaps it's a metal with a heavy isotope.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. So the reaction is probably a neutralization or something where the acid (keto acid) reacts with X. Keto acids are like carboxylic acids, I think. So for example, if X is a base, like NaOH or something, the reaction would produce a salt and water. If the product has two oxygen atoms, maybe it's a water molecule or something else.

Wait, but if the product is something from a keto acid and X, and it's two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a molecule like water, which has O, but wait, that's one O. Maybe it's a carbonate or something else. Or maybe the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like O2? No, that's a gas. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the reaction steps. Substance X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecular formula of W is such that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons (since C is 12, O is 16 each, but wait, for a single molecule, each atom contributes. Wait, W is a molecule, so each atom in it contributes to the total.

Wait, no, W is a molecule where each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in it. So,
