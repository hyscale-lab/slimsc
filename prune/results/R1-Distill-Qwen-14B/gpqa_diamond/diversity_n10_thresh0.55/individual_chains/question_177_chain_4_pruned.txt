Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it says. We've got two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about their luminosities. Oh right, but the problem says their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. And their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. 

Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2. So, the luminosity factor is how much bigger is Star_1's luminosity than Star_2's.

I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the stars radiate as black bodies. So that formula should apply. But what about the effective temperatures here?

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same as well. Because if λ_max is the same, T is the same too. Because T = b / λ_max.

Wait
