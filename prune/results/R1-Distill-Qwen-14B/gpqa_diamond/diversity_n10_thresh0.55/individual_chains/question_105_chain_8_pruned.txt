Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what's being asked.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius-wise. But one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view as it spins, causing brightness variations that look similar to what we'd see if there was an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. The task is to find out what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do. Essentially, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the change in brightness when a planet transits (passes in front of) the star. The key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness (the light curve's amplitude) caused by the planet and compare it to the amplitude caused by the star spots.

First, let's break down the information given:

- The star's radius, Rstar, is the same as the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun. I remember the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number. I can work with relative values.

- The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the filling factor is 0.2, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered in spots. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2). Because the area of a sphere is 4πr², so a hemisphere is 2πr². The spot covers 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πr² = 0.4πr². So the total spotted area is 0.4πr².

Wait, but when the star rotates, each spot comes into view. Since it's one hemisphere, the spots would be on the side that's facing us as the star rotates. So the observed effect is that when the spot is in front, it blocks some light, but the spot's temperature affects the brightness too.

But wait, the question says that the scenario can resemble an exoplanet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would do. So we need to find the planet radius that would give the same relative change in brightness.

Wait, but the problem says: to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, if the star wasn't covered by spots. So we need to calculate the brightness dip due to the spots and then find the planet that would cause the same dip.

I think the approach is to calculate the change in flux (brightness) caused by the spots and then equate that to the change caused by the planet transit.

But stars emit flux based on their temperature. So the spots are cooler, so they emit less flux than the surrounding photosphere.

Wait, but how does that affect the total observed flux? If a spot is on the side facing us, when the star rotates and the spot comes into view,
