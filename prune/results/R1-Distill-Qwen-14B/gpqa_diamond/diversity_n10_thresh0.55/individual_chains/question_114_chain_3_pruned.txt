Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what each reaction is doing.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide like NaCN, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, but that usually involves some kind of acid catalyst. Because the carbonyl is electrophilic, and the cyanide ion is a nucleophile.

Wait, but in the product here, there's a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, and the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The product structure would be (CH3)C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)C(OH)(CH2CN)CH3? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is
