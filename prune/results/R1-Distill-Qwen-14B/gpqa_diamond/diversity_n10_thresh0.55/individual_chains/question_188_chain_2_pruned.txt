Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let's see what I remember.

First, I recall that a rhombohedral crystal system is a type of hexagonal crystal, but wait, no, rhombohedral is actually part of the cubic system, right? Oh wait, no, rhombohedral is a separate system. Hmm. Anyway, the important thing is that all the edges are equal, and the angles between them are all the same. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a' in a cubic system, but wait, in rhombohedral, since the angles are not 90 degrees, the unit cell is different.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) is given by the formula: 1/dÂ² = (h
