Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The setup is a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.

So, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r is less than R, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E. I need to pick the correct one.

Let me recall what I know about conductors and electric fields. When a conductor is neutral and there's a charge inside a cavity, the charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged, so any induced charges must come from the cavity charge.

Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges inside a conductor reside on the surface. But here, the conductor has a cavity, so the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance that.

Wait, no. The conductor was initially uncharged. So when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must then have +q to balance the -q on the inside.

But wait, I think the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, making the total zero. Right.

Now, for a point outside the conductor, like point P, what's the electric field? The electric field due to a spherical charge distribution can be treated as if all the charge is concentrated at the center, provided you're outside. So, since point P is outside the conductor (radius R), the
