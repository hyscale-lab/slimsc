Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power dependencies on 1/plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. Right, so plx is inversely proportional to the distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually implies that the number density is constant. Oh, so the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate parallax to the number of stars in a certain range.

Let me think about how parallax relates to distance. Since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So each unit change in plx corresponds to a change in distance. But how does the number of stars in a given plx range relate to the volume?

The number of stars in a volume element depends on the volume. So, for a small range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding volume?

Wait, I think I should express the volume in terms of distance. The volume between distance d and d + dd is a spherical shell. The volume of a shell is 4π d² dd, where d is the radius. So, for each small distance interval, the volume depends on d squared times the thickness.

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the volume between d and d + dd is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But I need to express dd in terms of dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're talking about the range of plx, maybe I can consider the absolute value. So, for a change in plx of dplx, the change in d is dd = -d^2 dplx. Hmm, maybe I should avoid worrying about the negative sign for now.

Substituting d =1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) dplx ). Wait, but d is in terms of plx. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the volume element in terms of plx.

So, the volume element (dV) in terms of plx. Since dV = 4π d² dd, and dd = (d plx)/ (d^2). Because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² d plx.

Substituting d =1/plx, so dd = -(1/plx²)
