Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, it's about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, rhombohedral crystal structure—so that's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. I remember that rhombohedral systems can be either trigonal or something else, but the key point here is the structure. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which I think is the edge length 'a' of the unit cell. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees each. So all the angles are 30°, which is pretty small.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d(hkl) is calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ - 2 cos α cos β cos γ) )

Wait, no, that might not be right. Oh wait, another formula I think comes into play here. Or maybe it's simpler because for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I need to use the correct formula for a rhombohedral lattice.

Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / [ sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(θ) ) ]

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the structure factor and the interplanar distance might involve the angles. I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(α) )

Wait, but since all angles are equal (30°), maybe that simplifies things. So the formula would be:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because in a rhombohedral system, the angle between any two lattice vectors is the same. So for each pair of vectors, the angle is 30°, so cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866.

In this case, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Plugging the numbers:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) = 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) = 2*(3) =6.

So the numerator inside the sqrt is 3 - 6 * cos(30°). 

Calculating cos(30) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, so 6 * cos(30) ≈ 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So 3
