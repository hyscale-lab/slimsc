Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their mean lifetime can be related to their width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! I think the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. But wait, no, actually I think it's Γ = ħ/τ. Or is it the other way around? Because I remember that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So τ = ħ/(Γ). That seems right.

But wait, there's another thing. The particle's energy might affect its lifetime. Because particles moving faster have a shorter lifetime when observed from a certain frame. Oh wait, no—wait. The decay width Γ is usually the total decay rate, and that's measured in the rest frame of the particle. So the lifetime is τ = ħ/(Γ), regardless of the energy, because it's the proper time. So the mean decay distance would then be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Because the particle is moving, so distance is velocity * time.

So the steps are: calculate the lifetime τ, then find the velocity v of the particle, then multiply τ by v to get the mean decay length L = v * τ.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? I know the energy and mass. So the energy E is related to the velocity via E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, so gamma = E/(m c²). So gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV c²) * c²? Wait, E is given in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². Wait, let's think in terms of units.

The energy E is 8 GeV. The mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma is E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.6667 approximately.

Gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so solving for v. Let's compute beta = v/c. From gamma, we can find beta.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) → sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/gamma → 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1 - 1/gamma² → beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So plugging gamma ≈6.6667, 1/gamma² is 1/(44.444...) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Take square root: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me do the math step by step.

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma squared is (6.666666...)^2 = 44.444444...

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.444444, which is approximately 0.0225.

So 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775: let's see, 0.98 squared is 0.9604, 0.988 squared is (0.988)^2 = 0.976144. Hmm, 0.988^2 is about 0.9761, which is less than 0.9775. Let me compute 0.9887^2. 0.9887 * 0.9887: 

0.98^2 = 0.9604,
0.988^2 = 0.976144,
Let me do 9887 * 9887: but perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, use calculator steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a better approach. Let me compute the beta more accurately.

Compute gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

Gamma squared: (6.666666666666667)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 9/400 = (400 - 9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

What is sqrt(391)? Let's compute:

19^2 = 361, 20^2=400. So sqrt(361) =19, sqrt(391)= 19.774.

Wait, let's compute 19.774^2:

19^2 = 361,
0.774^2 ≈ 0.6 (since 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.774^2 is about 0.599),
Cross terms: 2*19*0.774 = approx 30.396.

So 361 + 30.396 + 0.599 = 391.995, which is close to 391. So sqrt(391) ≈19.774.

So beta = 19.774 / 20 = approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c. So velocity is about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but what are the units here? Γ is given in MeV. Hmm, because ħ has units of GeV s or something? Let me recall Planck's constant.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, let's get the units correct.

Wait, ħ in units of GeV·s: yes, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

But Γ is 320 MeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s.

Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → approx 20.56875e-25. Wait, no, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is equal to (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute 6.582 / 0.32 accurately.

0.32 × 20 = 6.4. So 6.582 -6.4 = 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 ≈ 0.56875. So 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds. Wait, is that correct? Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 GeV gives (6.582e-25 GeV s)/(0.32 GeV) ) → (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s → 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes.

Now, the mean decay length is L = v * τ. 

v is beta * c. So beta = approx 0.9887, so v = 0.9887 * c.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = beta * c * tau.

So substituting the numbers:

beta = 0.9887,

c = 3e8 m/s,

tau = 2.0568e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Let me compute each step.

0.9887 *3e8 = approximately 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau: 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

The seconds cancel out, so meters.

So 2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24 = Let's compute 2.9661 * 2.0568 = approx 6.107.

10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16.

So 6.107e-16 meters.

Wait, but let me compute 2.9661 * 2.0568 more accurately.

2.9661 × 2.0568.

Let me compute:

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322,

2.9661 * 0.0568 = approx 0.1687.

So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.1687 = 6.1009.

So approximately 6.1009e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me recalculate:

L = beta * c * tau.

beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.0568e-24 s.

So:

0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.0568e-24 s: 2.9661e8 * 2.0568e-24 = ?

2.9661 * 2.0568 ≈ 6.1009.

10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16.

So 6.1009e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Option C is 5.0223e-15, which is about 5e-15, which is 50 times larger than our 6e-16.

Wait, that's a big difference. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me check gamma again.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²), but wait, the units of E and m must be considered. E is given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. m is in GeV/c², which is the correct unit for mass (since E=mc², so m in GeV/c² times c² gives GeV).

So, gamma is E/(m c²) → (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) → 8 /1.2 → 6.666... as before.

So gamma is correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta more accurately.

gamma = 6.666666666666667.

So 1/gamma^2 is (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775) → let me compute this more accurately.

I can use a more precise method. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

I know that 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775 (as earlier). Let me confirm:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.0087 * 0.98 = 0.008526.

0.98 * 0.0087 = same 0.008526.

0.0087 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.00007569.

So adding all parts:

0.9604 + (0.008526 + 0.008526) + 0.00007569.

The cross terms: 0.008526 * 2 = 0.017052.

So 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452, plus 0.00007569 gives 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So beta is indeed approximately 0.9887.

So beta is correct.

Then, tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let me compute:

6.582 / 0.32 = let's see: 0.32 *20.5 = 6.56. 0.32 *20.56875 is 6.582. So 20.56875.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 =20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = beta * c * tau.

beta is 0.9887, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So:

0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau:

2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Calculating 2.9661 *2.056875:

Let me compute:

2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

0.9661 *2.056875:

0.9 *2.056875 = 1.8511875.

0.0661 *2.056875 ≈ 0.13589.

Adding together: 1.8511875 + 0.13589≈1.9870775.

So total is 4.11375 +1.9870775 ≈6.1008275.

So L≈6.1008e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5.0223 *1e-16 m

B)4.0655 *1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A and D, which are 5.02 and 4.06e-16, respectively. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The mean decay length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau? Or is it just beta c tau?

Wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the mean decay length is L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I was wrong earlier. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime. So the proper lifetime is tau = ħ/Γ, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, so perhaps I forgot to multiply by gamma in the decay length.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The particle's lifetime in its rest frame is tau = ħ/(Γ). When the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by a factor gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, but the mean decay length is the product of velocity and the lifetime as seen in the lab. So L = v * (gamma * tau).

Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the particle has more time to travel.

Wait, I think I missed that gamma factor earlier.

So in the initial calculation, I used tau as the proper lifetime. But in reality, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau, so L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake by not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is longer.

So let's recalculate.

L = beta * c * gamma * (ħ / Γ).

Because lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau = gamma ħ / Γ.

So L = beta gamma c (ħ / Γ).

Wait, but beta gamma is gamma beta, which is (gamma * beta).

Wait, but I can compute it more correctly.

So let me recompute with this in mind.

We have:

tau_rest = ħ / Γ.

tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

v = beta c.

So L = v * tau_lab = beta c gamma tau_rest.

Which is beta * gamma * c * (ħ/Γ).

But perhaps it's easier to substitute the numbers.

So let's compute it correctly.

L = beta * gamma * c * (ħ / Γ).

Alternatively, L = (beta gamma) * (c * ħ / Γ).

Wait, but beta gamma is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) ? Because gamma = E/(m c²), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ) / c²? Not sure, perhaps better to compute beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma can be found as (E / (m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) * (1/c).

Wait, perhaps I can think of beta gamma as (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^(1/2) / (m c^2).

Wait, let me think. Gamma = E/(m c²).

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E )^2 ) = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / E.

So beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / E * (E/(m c²)) ) → sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / (m c²).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute beta gamma.

Beta gamma = beta * gamma = (v/c) * (E/(m c^2)).

But v = beta c.

So beta gamma = (beta c) * (E/(m c^2)) ) * (1/c) ) → E/(m c^2) ) * beta.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute beta gamma as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) * (E/(m c^2)).

Which is (E/(m c^2)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) = (E/(m c^2)) ) * sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / E )= sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / (m c^2).

So sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4) ) / (m c^2).

Wait, but E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c².

E^2 = (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2.

m^2 c^4 = (1.2 GeV/c² )^2 * c^4 = (1.44 GeV^2) * c^4 / c^4 → 1.44 GeV^2.

So E² - m² c^4 = 64 -1.44 =62.56 GeV².

So sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So beta gamma = 7.91 GeV / (1.2 GeV c^2 ) = 7.91/(1.2) * (1/c^2 ) → Wait, no, wait, units are getting messed up here.

Wait, beta gamma is dimensionless, right? Because beta is v/c, gamma is unitless.

Wait, let me compute beta gamma as sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/(m c^2).

Wait, no, more accurately, beta gamma is (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)} ) / (m c²) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of E and m.

Wait, alternative approach: compute beta gamma as (E^2 - m^2 c^4)^0.5 / (m c^2).

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c^2 is 1.2 GeV. So E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 =62.56 GeV².

So sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

So beta gamma = 7.91 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) → 7.91 /1.2 ≈6.5917.

So beta gamma ≈6.5917.

So now, the decay length L is L = beta gamma * c * (ħ / Γ).

Wait, because L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_rest.

But tau_rest is ħ / Γ.

So L = beta gamma c ( ħ / Γ ).

So let's compute this.

Beta gamma is approximately 6.5917.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So L = 6.5917 * 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV.

Let me compute each part:

6.5917 * 3e8 = 1.97751e9 m/s.

(6.582e-25 GeV s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s → 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 1.97751e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply them together: 1.97751e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97751 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97751 * 2.056875:

Approximately, 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375.

But since it's 1.97751, which is about 2 - 0.02249.

So 2.056875 * (2 - 0.02249) = 4.11375 - 2.056875 * 0.02249.

Compute 2.056875 * 0.02249 ≈ 0.0463.

So 4.11375 - 0.0463 ≈ 4.06745.

So 4.06745e-15 meters.

Looking at the options: option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close to this.

So the correct answer should be option B, 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship \( L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \), where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}} \). The proper lifetime \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \) is given by \( \tau_{\text{rest}} = \hbar / \Gamma \), where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as \( \gamma = E / (m c^2) \), where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{rest}} \)
\[
\tau_{\text{rest}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{rest}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} = \beta \cdot c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]
Here, \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the values:
\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23}
\]
First, calculate \( 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \):
\[
0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]
Now multiply by \( 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \):
\[
L = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
