Okay, so I have this question about stars and their luminosities. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. Oh, wait, but I think the mass might not be directly relevant here because luminosity depends more on radius and temperature, right?

The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law, which says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature? Wait, no, same peak wavelength implies same temperature, because λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is same for both, T1 must equal T2.

But wait, could that be the case? Because if their sizes are different and they have the same temperature, their luminosities would depend on their radii. Because the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So if both have the same T, L is proportional to R squared. So Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 would be (1.5)^2 times L2, which is 2.25. But wait, the options include 2.25 as option A, but there are other options like ~2.23 and so on.

But wait, the question says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, but perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, the question also gives their radial velocities. Radial velocity is about how fast they're moving towards or away from us, but how does that affect luminosity? Hmm, perhaps it's a redshift or blueshift due to Doppler effect. Oh, because when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its light isn't Doppler shifted. Star_2 has a velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength from Star_2 might be different because of its motion. But wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their peak emission) are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but that depends on their actual temperatures and their velocities.

Ah, right, because when you have a Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is λ = λ0 (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, since Star_1's velocity is zero, its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted peak. For Star_2, if it's moving away or towards us, the observed peak would shift. But the question states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So, perhaps the actual temperatures are different because of their velocities, but their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, let me think again. If Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity of 700 km/s, then its emitted peak wavelength is λ2, but we observe it as λ2_observed = λ2 * (1 + v_r / c). But the question says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_observed = λ1_emitted (since v_r for Star_1 is 0)
λ2_observed = λ2_emitted * (1 + v_r2 / c) 

And λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

But from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So λ1_emitted = b / T1 and λ2_emitted = b / T2. 

So substituting, 

λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) 

=> (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Simplify: 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v_r2 / c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Since v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute 700 km/s in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333. So (1 + 0.002333) ≈ 1.002333. 

So T1 = T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997666 T2.

So the temperature of Star_1 is slightly lower than Star_2. Wait, but Star_1 is larger. So the luminosity of each star is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1² = 2.25 R2².

And T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997666.

So T1^4 ≈ (0.997666)^4 * T2^4.

Calculate (0.997666)^4: Let's compute 1 - 0.002334 ≈ 0.997666. So (0.997666)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.002334) ≈ 1 - 0.009336 ≈ 0.990664.

Wait, that's an approximation using binomial expansion. Alternatively, compute 0.997666^4.

Compute 0.997666^2: approx (1 - 0.002334)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.002334 + (0.002334)^2 ≈ 0.995332 + 0.000005 ≈ 0.995337.

Then square that: (0.995337)^2 ≈ 0.990700.

So T1^4 ≈ 0.9907 T2^4.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.9907) / (1) [since R is squared and T is to the fourth, so (2.25) * (0.9907)].

Wait, wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 * T1^4) / (R2^2 * T2^4) 

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T2/(1.002333))^4 ) / (R2^2 * T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2² / R2²) * (T2^4 / (1.002333)^4 T2^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / (1.002333)^4 )

Which is 2.25 * approx 0.9906? 

So 2.25 * 0.9906 ≈ 2.22735.

Wait, but wait: 1.002333 is (1 + 700/(3e5)) = (1 + 0.002333). So (1.002333)^4 is approximately 1 + 4*0.002333 = 1.009332. Wait, no, that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute (1.002333)^4 using binomial expansion. 

Let x = 0.002333.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x⁴.

x is small, so terms beyond x^2 are negligible.

x ≈ 0.002333, so x squared is about 5.44e-6.

So,

4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332
6x² ≈6 *5.44e-6 ≈ 3.264e-5
4x^3 ≈4*(0.002333)^3 ≈4 * 1.26e-8 ≈5e-8 (negligible)
x^4 even smaller.

So total is approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.00003264 ≈ 1.00936464.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.00936464.

So 1/(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1/(1.00936464) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.22735.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is very close.

So the factor is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), right? So the observed peak wavelength is longer for Star_2 because it's moving away. But the question says both stars have the same observed peak wavelength. So for Star_2, its emitted wavelength would be shorter than what we observe, because we see it redshifted. So when we compute the temperature, T2 would be higher than what we thought if we just took observed wavelength. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the direction. If Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. Wait no, the Doppler shift formula is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), assuming v_r is positive when moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, λ_observed for Star_2 is longer than λ_emitted. So λ_observed for Star_2 is λ2 * (1 + v_r/c), which is larger than λ2.

But λ_observed for Star_1 is λ1, because its velocity is zero. So λ1 = λ_observed for Star_1, and λ_observed for Star_2 is λ2*(1 + v_r/c). The problem states that the observed wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars. So:

λ1 = λ2_obs.

But λ1 = b / T1, and λ2_obs = λ2*(1 + v_r/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r/c).

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c)

=> 1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r/c )

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c )

Which brings us back to the same equation as before. So T1 = T2 / (1 + 700/(3e5)) ≈ T2 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.997666 T2.

So same as before.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 

= (1.5)^2 * (0.997666)^4.

Which is 2.25 * approx 0.9907, which is ~2.227.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is more straightforward. Because initially, without considering velocities, if both have same T, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But considering the Doppler shift, their temperatures are slightly different, which reduces the luminosity of Star_1 compared to that initial 2.25, making it around 2.23. So the correct answer would be D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and a mass 1.5 times that of Star_2.
   - Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, implying their observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are identical.
   - Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s.
   - Luminosity is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \) (Stefan-Boltzmann law).

2. **Temperature Relationship**:
   Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), we account for the Doppler shift for Star_2:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{em,2}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c),
   \]
   where \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting, we find:
   \[
   \frac{\lambda_{\text{em,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{em,2}}} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{v_r}{c}.
   \]
   Thus, \( T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_r/c) \). With \( v_r/c = 700 / 300,000 \approx 0.002333 \), we calculate:
   \[
   T_1 \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997666.
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   The luminosity ratio is given by:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_1 = 0.997666 T_2 \), we compute:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.997666)^4.
   \]
   First, \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, \( (0.997666)^4 \) is approximated using the binomial expansion:
   \[
   (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x + 6x^2, \quad \text{where } x = 1 - 0.997666 = 0.002334.
   \]
   This gives \( (0.997666)^4 \approx 0.9907 \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately 2.23. Among the given options, the closest match is:
