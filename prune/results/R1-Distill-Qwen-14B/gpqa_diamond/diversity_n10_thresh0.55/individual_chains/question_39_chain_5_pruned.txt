Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, wait. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm. I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable for it to be a valid probability distribution. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function must equal 1 because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

But wait, the wave function here has an imaginary part. So, it's a complex function. The usual approach is to take the absolute square, which would be the probability density. So, the probability density is the square of the modulus of the wave function.

Let me write down the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, ψ(x) is a complex number. The modulus squared is (a^2)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2, because when you have a complex number a + ib, the modulus squared is a² + b². Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5)i. So it's a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5i). So, ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)*i, where A(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) and B(x) = -0.5.

So the modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = [A(x)]² + [B(x)]². So [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So that's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you have a complex number in the form of (real part) + i*(imaginary part), the modulus squared would be (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the particle is found between x=1 and x=3. So
