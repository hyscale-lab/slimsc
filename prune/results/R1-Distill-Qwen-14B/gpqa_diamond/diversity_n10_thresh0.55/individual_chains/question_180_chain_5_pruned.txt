Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each has a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. All these particles have negligible mass, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”maybe it's all potential energy then.

The setup is a bit specific: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so point P has one charge, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. 

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Energy in an electrostatic context usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since the system is isolated, I'm assuming we're considering the potential energy stored due to the arrangement of these charges. So I need to calculate the total potential energy of all the charges in this setup.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Because each charge interacts with every other charge. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the
