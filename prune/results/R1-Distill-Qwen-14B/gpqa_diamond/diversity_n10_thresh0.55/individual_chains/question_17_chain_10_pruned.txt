Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm. So, I'm dealing with a complex ion dissociation. Right, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The K given is the formation constant, Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The reaction for the formation of the complex is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. So Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Oh wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions, so that's the [Ca²+] in solution.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

So the equilibrium would be: CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. Wait, but Kf is for the formation of the complex. So, the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf because Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA²−] = 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, but wait. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. But as it dissociates, the [Ca²
