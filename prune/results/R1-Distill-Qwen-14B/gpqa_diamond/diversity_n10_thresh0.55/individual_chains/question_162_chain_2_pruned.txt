Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that metrics describe the geometry of a space. This looks like it's in two dimensions because there are dx and dy terms. So maybe it's a 2D metric embedded in some higher-dimensional space or something else?

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Isn't that a surface with constant negative curvature? Oh right, I think it's an example of a surface in hyperbolic geometry. The pseudosphere has a finite volume but infinite surface area, but wait, that's the regular pseudosphere, right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, the metric here is given in terms of x and y. Let me see the denominator: 4 - x² - y². That looks a bit like the equation of a circle because x² + y² = r². So 4 is like radius squared, so radius 2. Oh, right, because 2 squared is 4. So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)) which suggests that the region where this metric is defined is where x² + y² <4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, what kind of geometry does this metric describe?

The metric can be written as ds² = [32 / (4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Because in polar coordinates
