Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a neutralization reaction.

Alright, the first step is to figure out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³ because 20 + 20 =40. Let me calculate M2. M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) /40 cm³. That gives M2 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So I need to find out how much NaOH is added at that point.

The moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity * Volume. The volume is 40 cm³ (since we diluted it), which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001 moles. Now, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Wait, but wait. The question isn't asking about the volume at equivalence, but the pH. At equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution because the acid has been neutralized by the base. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The concentration of sodium acetate would be calculated as moles divided by total volume
