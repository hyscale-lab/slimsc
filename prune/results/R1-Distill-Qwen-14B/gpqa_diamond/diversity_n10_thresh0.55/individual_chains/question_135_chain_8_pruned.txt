Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem gives me a Lagrangian term and some information about the mass of the boson X. The question is about kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Alright, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, I think it's written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So that's the interaction term. So the interaction is between the boson field X and fermion fields ψ_f. The fermions involved are ψ_f, and the coupling is λ f. So the coupling is proportional to the fermion mass? Or maybe f is the fermion field. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about f's role here. Oh wait, maybe the term is -λ f \bar{ψ}_f X ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Yukawa coupling term is something like λ ψ_f^† ψ_f X, but I'm not certain.

But maybe that's not the main point right now. The main issue is the mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion pairs X can decay into. Because each decay would require that the sum of the fermion masses is less than the mass of X. Because in particle physics, a particle can't decay into something heavier than itself, unless considering rest mass and kinetic energy, but for the decay to be allowed, the total mass of the products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Wait, wait. Wait, for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the fermion masses must be such that their sum is less than the boson's mass. Oh, wait, no. Because each fermion would need to have a mass less than half the boson's mass. Because when a boson at rest decays into two particles, each must have enough energy to have their rest mass. So for a fermion pair f fbar, each fermion has mass m_f. The total rest mass is 2 m_f. So 2 m_f must be less than or equal to m_X. So m_f <= m_X /2.

So m_X is 6 GeV. So m_f must be <= 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by
