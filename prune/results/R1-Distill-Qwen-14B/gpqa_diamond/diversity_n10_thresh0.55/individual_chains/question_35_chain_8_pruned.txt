Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are related to spin matrices. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix when dealing with spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, I think.

The given operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a given 2x2 matrix. The matrix S first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So let me write that down:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something maybe? Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh, wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], exactly like S here. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * S. And c is h/(4π). So Ay equals (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, right? Because for spin-1/2 systems, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. The spin matrices for a spin-1/2 particle are S = (ħ/2) * σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So each component of the spin operator is (ħ/2) times σ.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is given as c * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. So let me compute c first. c is h/(4π). Hmm, planck's constant h is 2π ħ, right? Because ħ = h/(2π). So substituting, c = (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = (2π ħ) / (4π) = ħ / 2. Oh, interesting. So c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2
