Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. There are several steps, so I'll need to break them down one by one.

The reaction scheme is:

Compound A → reacts with HCN → Compound B

Compound B → reduced with H2 and Pd → Compound C

Compound C → reacts with HNO2 → Compound D

Compound D → elimination of an inert gas → Compound E

And there are some hints provided. Hmm, let me look at that.

Hint a says: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Okay, wait, phosphorous ylides usually are used in Wittig reactions. So Wittig reactions form alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So Compound A must be a carbonyl compound (like an aldehyde or ketone), because that's what reacts in a Wittig reaction.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is like a CH2-C(CH3)- group attached as a double bond? So the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups, and at position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group (which is CH2-C(CH3)=). But wait, the product is an alkene, so the Wittig adds a double bond. So the starting material (A) must have a carbonyl group which becomes the double bond after reaction.

Wait, but the product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. So thinking about it, the ylide must have added a group to the ring. Alternatively, maybe the ylide is reacting with a carbonyl group attached to the cyclopentane structure. Hmm.

Wait, let me try to visualize. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So it's a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at C1 and C2, and at C4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group which is a double bond. So the structure would be: cyclopentane with methyl groups on adjacent carbons, and at another position, a substituent that is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C= attached via a CH2 group?

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (propenylidene) group. So, the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is probably (CH3)2C=.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Wittig reaction forms an alkene between the ylide's carbon and the carbonyl's carbon. So if the ylide is, say, PR2-CH2-C(CH3)= something? Wait, no, the ylide would have a structure like PR2+CH
