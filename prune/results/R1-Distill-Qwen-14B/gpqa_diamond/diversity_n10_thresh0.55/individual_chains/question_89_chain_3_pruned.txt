Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, to form an alkene. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane should give an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The product 1 is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are often less polar and solids can be yellow due to conjugation or other structures.

The NMR spectrum of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H), and an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Wait, the IR peak at 1720 usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But product 1 is from an elimination reaction, which should be an alkene. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Oh wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is used in a different condition, like if it's a substitution instead.

Wait, the reaction is heating with excess KOH. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons. So when it reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) to form an alkene. But if it's heated with KOH in a solution, maybe it's a strong base causing elimination, producing an alkene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But then the IR shows a peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. But with two bromines adjacent, that's unlikely. No, substitution would typically require a good leaving group and a base to deprotonate, but elimination is more likely here because of the adjacent leaving groups. Hmm, maybe product 1 is an epoxide? Wait, no, KOH probably doesn't form an epoxide.

Wait, another thought. If I have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and I treat it with KOH, perhaps it's a double de
