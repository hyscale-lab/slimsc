Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question has two reactions, and I need to select the right reagents A and B from the options given. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves another compound reacting with reagent B and water to form a carboxylic acid.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methyl acetone, (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion, CN⁻. So, the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon, right? But wait, what's happening after that?

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN⁻ would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but butanenitrile would have four carbons. Let me see. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN⁻ would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN? But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
