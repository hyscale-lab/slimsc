Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them. 

The data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. I'm supposed to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet. The velocity of the star is what causes the spectral line shifts.

The formula I recall is that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination angle. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) * (2π) )^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (P) )^(-1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simpler relation when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is the case here because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun.

In that case, the formula for the semi-amplitude simplifies. Let me think: K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / (c * (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's still not right. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star
