Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, we've got an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. Hmm, so the 13th one is fixed, and the others are all at 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I need to figure out the right formula to apply.

I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is calculated based on the configuration of charges. Since all the charges are identical, they'll repel each other. The potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But wait, when calculating the potential energy of a system, I think we have to consider all pairs.

So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12
