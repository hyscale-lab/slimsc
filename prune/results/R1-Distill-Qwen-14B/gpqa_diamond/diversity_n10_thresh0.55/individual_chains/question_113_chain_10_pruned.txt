Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, what functional groups have those peaks? Well, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ring with substituents or an amide? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group.

Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with some electron withdrawal. Alternatively, I'm thinking maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but that usually is around 1600 cm^-1. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me note that we have a carbonyl and maybe another group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. So maybe an alkene is present. Also, the presence of O-H (from the broad FTIR) and a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is something like a ketone with an alcohol group, but wait, that might not fit with the functional groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have both a carbonyl and an O-H group. But wait, their O-H is usually very broad and strong, which matches the FTIR data. But what about the 1650 peak? In a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, which matches the 1700 peak. The 1650 might be an overtone or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups around 1700-1
