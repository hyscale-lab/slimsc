Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand the given state vector. The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's not normalized yet, right? So I should probably normalize it first.

The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator, which I know are orthonormal. So the normalization involves finding the magnitude squared of each coefficient and adding them. Let's calculate the coefficients:

Coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, else 0. Wait, the operator is a 2x2 matrix? Let me think: since it's acting on spin-1/2 particles, which have two states, up and down. So i and j can be 1 and 2, corresponding to up and down. So what's the matrix form?

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Is that right? Because when i != j (so when i=1,j=2 and i=2,j=1), A_ij is ħ/2. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So this operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli matrices are 2x2, and A_ij is (ħ/2) times that.

So operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x. Sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are
