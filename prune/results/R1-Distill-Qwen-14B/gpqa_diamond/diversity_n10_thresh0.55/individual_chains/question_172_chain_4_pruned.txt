Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both stars' photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The equation is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number densities, g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given, and the ratio of excitation is provided. So, for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the excitation level as the population of the higher energy level, say level i, relative to a lower level j. So for star_1, (n_i1 / n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2). Because the problem says star_1 is twice as excited, so the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, no. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in that specific level. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is higher. Let's say the ratio is n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). Because star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2.

Wait, but I think I need to model each star's situation. For each star, I can write the Boltzmann equation.

Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. So for star_1, the ratio is (n_i1/n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly for star_2, (n_i2/n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, since they're both iron atoms in the same energy levels. So we can set g_i/g_j as a common factor, which will cancel out when taking the ratio of the two ratios.

So, (n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2)) ) ].

Simplifying this ratio, since n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * n_i2/n_j2 (because star_1 is twice as excited), so the left side is 2.

So 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait. Let me re-express that. Because [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

So yes, ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck the math.

The ratio is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1
