Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by trying to understand what the question is asking.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at two different points: when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted (25% titration) and at the equivalence point.

I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, when they react, it's a neutralization reaction where the acid donates protons to the base. The reaction would be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

First, I need to find the initial moles of acetic acid before any titration. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for the initial solution before adding water: M = 0.05 M, volume = 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, making the new concentration 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the initial solution was 20 cm³, adding another 20 cm³ makes 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Oh right, that's correct.

But wait, maybe I should calculate moles after dilution. Initial moles of acetic acid is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. When we add 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. Let's think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed is equal to moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's first find the pH at 25% titration.

25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, moles reacted = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point would be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (25% of 10 cm³) which is 2.5 cm³. So total volume = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of concentrations and the buffer solution that exists before the equivalence point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to form acetate ions. So the solution will be a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes into play here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. The Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) wait, no, wait. Actually, pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5).

Let me calculate that: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 → log is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733, approximately.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] would be (0.25)/(1-0.25) = 1/3. Because for every mole of acid that reacts, you get a mole of conjugate base. So if 25% has reacted, the concentration of acetate is 0.25/(1) times the initial concentration? Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate moles.

Initial moles acetic acid: 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, moles reacted = 0.00025. So moles of HA left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added (since 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but what about the equivalence point pH? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic.
