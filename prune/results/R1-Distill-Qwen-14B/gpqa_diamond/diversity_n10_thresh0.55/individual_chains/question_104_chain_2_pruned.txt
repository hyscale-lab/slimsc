Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method.

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift red (longer wavelength). The periodic shift indicates the planet's presence because the star is moving in response to the planet's gravity.

The question gives the shift in the spectral line for each planet. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, but I thought the RV method measures the velocity of the star, not the shift directly. Oh, right, the shift in wavelength relates to the velocity through the Doppler effect formula. But how does that tie into the orbital period?

I remember that the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is something like K = (v * (M_planet/M_star))^(1/3) or something similar. Wait, maybe I should look at the relation between the velocity and the orbital period.

Wait, Kepler's third law might come into play here. The formula for the orbital period is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) * a³. But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So P² is proportional to a³/(M_star). But M_star is the same for both stars, so P² is proportional to a³.

Now, how does this connect to the RV method and the velocity shift? The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude K of the star. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something) ) * something else. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of circular orbits.

The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The velocity of the star is K, and the planet's velocity is much
