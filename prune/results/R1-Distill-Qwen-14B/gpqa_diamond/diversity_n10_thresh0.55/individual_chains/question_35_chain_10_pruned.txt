Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ), where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, and then determine which statement among the options is correct.

Wait, let me break this down. First, I should probably write out the matrix S. S is a 2x2 matrix where the first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[i    0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), the operator Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix. So Ay = c * S. Let me compute that.

So, c = h/(4π). Therefore, each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay is:

[ c*0    c*(-i) ]
[ c*i     c*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0     (-i c) ]
[ i c     0 ]

Substituting c = h/(4π), that gives:

[ 0      -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0 ]

Hmm. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix with these entries.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's start with the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues a are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[ -a      -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4π) ) ] = a² - [ (i^2 h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, because the (2,1) element is (i h)/(4π) and the (1,2) is -(i h)/(4π). So the determinant is (a^2) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ]

Wait, the product is [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ] because the off-diagonal terms are in positions (1,2) and (2,1). So when you compute the determinant, it's (Ay_11 * Ay_22) - (Ay_12 * Ay_21).

Wait, more accurately, the determinant is (Ay_11 - a)(Ay_22 - a) - (Ay_12)(Ay_21). So:

(Ay_11 - a) = -a

(Ay_2
