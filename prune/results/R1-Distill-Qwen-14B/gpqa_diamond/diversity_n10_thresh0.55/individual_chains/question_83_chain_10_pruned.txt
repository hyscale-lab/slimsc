Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, so we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

First, I need to figure out what happens when the acetic acid is diluted. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. When we dilute it, the concentration decreases, but the degree of dissociation increases. So the pH should go up a bit from the original solution.

But wait, the initial solution is 0.05 M acetic acid. Let me calculate the initial pH before any NaOH is added. But wait, the problem isn't directly asking that; it's about the diluted solution before titration.

Wait, no. The initial solution is diluted by adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid. So the new volume is 40 cm³, and the concentration is halved, right? Because volume doubles, concentration halves. So the new concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

But then, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O. So the equivalence point will be when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions.

Wait, let me think about the moles. The initial moles of acetic acid: volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) times 0.05 M. So 0
