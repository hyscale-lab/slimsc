Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a disubstituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data.

Wait, wait. Let's break this down. A 6-membered aromatic ring, so that's like benzene. It's disubstituted, so two substituents on the ring. The total carbons are 8â€”so the ring has 6 carbons, meaning the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent would be a group that adds one carbon each, or maybe one substituent is a larger group?

Wait, no. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons. The molecule has 8 carbons in total, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon each, or maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group. Let me think: if it's two substituents, each could be a methyl group, but that would add 2*1=2, so total 6+2=8. Hmm, but wait, benzene has six, substituents add two. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an acyl group) and another is a halogen.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which suggests a C=O stretch. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so something like a -X group attached to the ring.

So, the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, another is a halogen. But wait, wait. Wait, the substituents themselves have carbons. For example, an acetyl group (CO-) would have two carbons, right? Because it's R-CO-. So if the substituents are a CO group and a halogen, let's see.

Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, substituents are X and (maybe) R. So if substituent R is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl (COCH3?), but that would add more carbons.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons total. Benzene is 6, so substitu
