Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read through it again and think about how to approach it.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The given data includes:
- Mass of atom X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of atom Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency of vibration (w) = 4e14 rad/s

The options are four different momenta values, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can be in different energy states, including rotational and vibrational. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When a photon is absorbed, it provides energy that can cause a transition to a higher state.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So what's the next state with the lowest energy? I think in the rigid rotor-vibration model, the energy states are quantized. But this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe some aspects are different.

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model accounts for the bond length changing during rotation, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes a fixed bond length. But for the purpose of energy levels, I think the approach is somewhat similar, but perhaps the moment of inertia is treated differently.

Wait, but maybe I should first consider the possible transitions. The molecule is in its ground state (fundamental), and the photon causes a transition to the next state. But what's the next state? Is it the first excited rotational state, the first vibrational state, or a combination?

Wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or maybe J=1, but I'm not certain about the exact details here).

Wait, no, the rigid rotor model has energy levels given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the total energy
