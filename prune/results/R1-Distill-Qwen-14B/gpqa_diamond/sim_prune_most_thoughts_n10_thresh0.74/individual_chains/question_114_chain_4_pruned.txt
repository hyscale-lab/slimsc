Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents. Let me take it step by step. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So ketones have a carbonyl group, and the CN- can attack there. 

Wait, but if NaCN is used, that's providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The reaction would add CN- to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. It's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, no, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the hydroxyl and nitrile groups on the same carbon. So structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CN. Hmm. 

Wait, so when a ketone reacts with HCN (or in this case, NaCN with some acid?), it forms a cyanohydrin. Right, the cyanohydrin formation. The mechanism is that the cyanide attacks the carbonyl, and then the oxygen gets protonated. So, butan-2-one plus HCN (or NaCN under acidic conditions) would form the cyanohydrin. 

So for that, the typical reagents are an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B). Because the reaction usually requires some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+.

The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B in water to get 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I think the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involves hydrolysis. There are different conditions for that. One common method is strong acidic conditions. Like using HCl (H+ and Cl-) as the catalyst. Alternatively, maybe using a base, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, another thought: the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under different conditions. For example, under acidic conditions with HCl, or using a strong base like aqueous KOH with heat. But the product here is a carboxylic acid, which suggests that the conditions are acidic because the carboxylic acid is the final product. 

Wait, but another possibility is ozonolysis or something else. No, because the nitrile is being converted to a COOH group. So, hydrolysis. In the presence of water and HCl, perhaps. Or maybe using a peracid or something else. Wait, another method for nitrile to carboxylic acid is treating with H2O with HCl as a catalyst. 

So in the second step, reagent B is H
