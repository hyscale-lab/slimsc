Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying compound X based on the given NMR data after a reaction. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand the reaction conditions. The compound X is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh wait, no, actually, wait. That reagent is used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, like diols or certain alkenes. Hmm, but wait, Sharpless conditions are usually for epoxidizing epoxides from epoxides? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe it's a peracid used for epoxidation, but no, peracids are more common for that. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh, wait, no, I think that structure is similar to a crown ether. Oh, right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually used as a base in certain reactions, maybe like in the formation of epoxides via acid-catalyzed ring opening? Or perhaps it's acting as a catalyst in an elimination reaction? Hmm, not entirely sure. But the key point is that it's involved in a reaction that produces an epoxide.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So perhaps compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation, converting a double bond into an epoxide.

Wait, the product's structure is what's given in the NMR. So perhaps the starting material (X) was an epoxide, which underwent some reaction, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe X is an alkene, which after reaction with the reagent forms an epoxide, and the NMR is of the epoxide product. Hmm, but the options are about the starting compound X, which after this reaction becomes something else. Or maybe X is the
