Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what I remember about this.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. All have circular orbits, which probably simplifies some calculations.

The planets are studied using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that affects the equilibrium temperature, so I can maybe ignore that part for now.

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Oh, right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but wait. Another way I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the planet absorbs that. So the temperature scales as T ~ (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. But simplifying, since all planets orbit the same star, L and σ and other constants will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the temperature ratio depends on a.

But wait, the orbital periods are given. So I need to relate the orbital period to the semi-major axis. I remember Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So (P^2) ∝ (a^3). More precisely, P² = (4π²/GM) a³, but for the same star, M is constant. So a³ ∝ P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So each planet's a is proportional to their period to the power 2/3. So if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

Wait, but the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) = (L)^(1/4) * a^(-1/2). So the bigger a is, the smaller T, which makes sense.

So the ratio of T4 to T2 is sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ). Because T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2).

Wait, let me double-check. Let's say T = T0 * (1/(sqrt(a))) ), where T0 is a constant. Then T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)] / [1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

Right, so I need to compute a2 and a4 first.

The periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So let's assign variables. Let me let P1 = P, then P2 = 2P, P3 = 2.5P, P4=3.5P, P5=5P.

Since a ∝ P^(2/3), then a2 = (2P)^(2/3) = 2^(2/3) * P^(2/3).

Similarly, a4 = (3.5 P)^(2/3) = (7/2)^(2/3) * P^(2/3).

So the ratio a2/a4 = (2^(2/3)) / ( (7/2)^(2/3) ) ) = [ (2^2) / (7/2)^2 ] ^ (1/3) ?

Wait, no. Wait, 2^(2/3) divided by (7/2)^(2/3) is equal to [ (2)/(7/2) ]^(2/3) ) = [ (4/7) ]^(2/3).

Wait, (2)/(7/2) is (2*2)/7 = 4/7. So yeah, a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that. a2 is (2P)^(2/3), a4 is (3.5 P)^(2/3) = (7/2 P)^(2/3). So a2/a4 = [2/(7/2)]^(2/3) = [ (4/7) ]^(2/3).

So the ratio is (4/7)^(2/3). Then T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = [ (4/7)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, because sqrt is same as raising to the 1/2 power. So (4/7)^(2/3 * 1/2) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Hmm, how do I calculate (4/7)^(1/3)?

Well, 4 is 2², 7 is prime. So 4/7 = (2²)/7. The cube root of that would be (2^2)^(1/3) / (7)^(1/3) )= 2^(2/3) / 7^(1/3).

Alternatively, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Taking the cube root of that. Let me think about numbers.

I know that 0.5³ is 0.125, 0.6³ is 0.216, 0.7³ is 0.343, 0.8³ is 0.512, 0.9³ is 0.729.

Wait, 0.79³ is about 0.79 * 0.79 = 0.6241, times 0.79 ≈ 0.493. Hmm.

Wait, but 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So the cube root of that would be a number x where x^3 = 0.5714.

Looking for x such that x³ ≈ 0.5714.

We can try x=0.83. 0.83³ is 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh, that's very close to 0.5714.

Wow, so cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 is ~0.83? Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. If (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, then T4 is 0.83 times T2. So the ratio is 0.83.

Wait, but the question is the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2's temperature. So T4 / T2 is 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that would be the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let's go through each step again.

1. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis: T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

2. Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3).

3. So a4 = (3.5)^(2/3) * P1^(2/3), a2 = (2)^(2/3) * P1^(2/3).

4. Ratio a2/a4 = (2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) → [ (2)/(3.5) ]^(2/3) → (4/7)^(2/3) → [4/7]^(2/3).

Wait, wait, 2 is 2, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So a2/a4 = (4/7)^(2/3).

Then T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Which is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the temperature ratio is T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) ), which is the same as sqrt( (a2/a4) ). So yes.

So 4/7 is about 0.5714. Its cube root is about 0.83. So the ratio is 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis: 

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is proportional to the orbital period \(P\) raised to the power of \(2/3\): 

\[
a \propto P^{2/3}
\]

Given the orbital periods of the planets are in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\), let \(P_1 = P\). Then:

- \(P_2 = 2P\)
- \(P_4 = 3.5P\)

The semi-major axes are proportional to their periods raised to \(2/3\):

\[
a_2 \propto (2P)^{2/3}, \quad a_4 \propto (3.5P)^{2/3}
\]

The ratio of \(a_2\) to \(a_4\) is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \frac{(2P)^{2/3}}{(3.5P)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}
\]

To approximate \(\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}\), note that \(4/7 \approx 0.5714\). The cube root of \(0.5714\) is approximately \(0.83\). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\).

From the given options:

- **A) ~0.57**: Too low.
- **B) ~0.69**: Too low.
- **C) ~0.83**: Correct.
- **D) ~0.75**: Close but slightly off.
