Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. So the question is about isomers and tautomerism, I think. Let me read it again.

The question says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers, which can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements. 

Then the question asks two parts: A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Hmm. I need to figure out each part step by step.

Starting with part A. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let me think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone can refer to either para-benzoquinone or ortho. Para has two ketone groups opposite each other on a benzene ring. So its structure is like O=C6H4=O, but actually, wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, no, actually, quinones are cyclic with two keto groups. So it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. But wait, in para benzoquinone, the two keto groups are on opposite positions, so 1,4 positions. So the structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, no, actually, it's benzene with two ketones, so O=C6H4=O is not correct. Alternatively, the structure is a cyclohexadienedione. So the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at para positions. So the molecule is O=C6H4=O, but that's not the right way to write it. Alternatively, it's a cyclic structure where the two carb
