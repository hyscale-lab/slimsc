Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, I'm a bit mixed up. So the initial probability is 32% for 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, it's still not decayed. Does that affect the probability for the next 150 minutes? Or is the decay process memoryless? Oh right, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which means the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed. So the process is memoryless, right?

Hmm, wait, so if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, does that change anything? No, because each atom has a constant probability per unit time, independent of how much time has passed. So the decay probability in the next period is still based on the remaining time.

Wait, but the initial probability given is 32% for 100 minutes. So what's the decay constant here? Let me think about the exponential decay formula.

The decay probability (or cumulative probability) is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But the problem says that P(100) = 0.32. So I can use that to find λ.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let's rearrange that: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68): ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but wait, 0.68 is less. Let me compute it more accurately. I know that ln(0.7) ≈ -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit smaller, so ln(0.68) is about -0.4005.

Wait, actually, let me calculate it. I'll use a calculator approach. Let's see, 0.68 is the value. So ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(17*4/100) = wait, maybe I can just remember that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005.

So λ = (0.4005) / 100 ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, that's 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. But
