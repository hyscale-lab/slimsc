Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is from hydrogen, specifically the transition from n=2 to n=1. But wait, in this case, the clouds are absorbing the light, so they're causing a absorption line. Right, the quasar emits light, and these hydrogen clouds absorb it at the Lyman alpha wavelength.

But the problem is about redshift. Redshift tells us how much the wavelength of the light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So the observed wavelength will be longer (redshifted) if the object is moving away from us.

The key here is that the clouds are neutral hydrogen, so they must be at a redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption is still in the observable range for ground-based optical telescopes. Because if the wavelength is too far into the infrared, optical telescopes can't see it.

So, optical telescopes can observe wavelengths from about 300 nm (near-ultraviolet) up to around 1000 nm (near-infrared), I think. But wait, wait, optical usually refers to visible light, which is roughly 400-700 nm. But some telescopes might go a bit beyond into near-infrared or near-UV.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far-ultraviolet, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. So if the quasar's Lyman alpha line is observed at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame), but the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

So we need lambda_obs to be within the range detectable by ground-based optical telescopes. Let's say the optical range is ~300 nm to maybe 900 nm. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think. Well, most optical telescopes can't observe below about 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms) because the atmosphere doesn't let that through. So the observed wavelength needs to be at least 300 nm for ground-based optical.

So, the observed Lyman alpha wavelength must be >= 300 nm. So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) >= 3000 Angstroms (since 300 nm is 3000 Angstroms). Wait, wait, no, wait: wait the Lyman alpha is in the rest frame of the cloud. So the quasar's emitted light at 1216 Angstroms is absorbed by the cloud. But when we observe it, the wavelength is shifted.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me write the formula.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is equal to the rest wavelength multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So, λ_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z)

But for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical range (so that it can be detected by ground-based telescopes), λ_obs must be less than or equal to about 900 nm, because beyond that is infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see? Or wait, no. Wait, optical is about 400-700 nm, but some go a bit beyond, perhaps into the near-IR. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the cutoff as the point where the wavelength is observable in optical, say, up to 1 micron (1000 nm). Hmm.

Wait, but the quasar's light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. So the absorption line we see is at λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We need this λ_obs to be in the range of optical wavelengths that can be detected. So, the lower limit on z would be when λ_obs is just beyond the near-ultraviolet, which is maybe around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). Wait, no, because a higher redshift makes λ_obs longer. Wait, no. Wait, λ_obs is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

So, if the observed wavelength is longer than a certain value, it's in the optical range. Let's think about the maximum redshift such that λ_obs is within the detectable range.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that the absorption can be detected. Because if the redshift is too low, the observed wavelength would be in the far-ultraviolet, which is not observable from the ground. So the clouds must be at a redshift where the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical.

So, the minimal z is when λ_obs is just within the detectable range. Let's say the maximum detectable wavelength is about 900 nm (9000 Angstroms). So:

λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) <= 9000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait, no. Let me think again. If the cloud is at redshift z, the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) is observed at 1216*(1+z). For this to be in the optical, λ_obs must be >= some value, perhaps 3000 Angstroms (300 nm, which is near the edge of what's transmitted by the atmosphere). Because if λ_obs is less than 3000 Angstroms, it's in the far-UV, which doesn't reach the ground.

Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which would correspond to the minimal z needed for the line to be observable. So, when z is too low, the observed wavelength is too short (still UV), which we can't detect. So the minimal z is when λ_obs is just 3000 Angstroms.

So:

1216*(1 + z) = 3000

Solve for z:

1 + z = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.467

z ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467.

Hmm, so z ≈ 1.47. Looking at the options, option D is 1.9, B is 1.2, C is 2.4, and A is 3.

Wait, wait, but perhaps the upper limit of the optical is higher. Let me think again. The atmospheric transmission window for optical is about 300 nm to about 1000 nm (1 micron), but most optical telescopes can't go much beyond 800-900 nm. So perhaps the upper limit is 900 nm (9000 Angstroms). But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, the lower limit would be when the observed wavelength is just reaching the lower end of the optical.

Wait another approach: let's compute for λ_obs = 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So:

z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 2.467 - 1 ≈ 1.467.

So z ≈ 1.47. So the minimal redshift is about 1.47. So, any object with z ≥ 1.47 would have its Lyman alpha line observed at 300 nm or longer. But can ground-based optical telescopes observe down to 300 nm? I think 300 nm is the lower limit for what's transmitted by the atmosphere. So if the observed wavelength is 300 nm, that's the cutoff. So the minimal z is about 1.47, which is approximately 1.5.

Looking at the options, the choices are B) 1.2, D)1.9.

Wait, 1.47 is close to 1.5. But the options don't have 1.5. So perhaps the question expects us to use a different cutoff for the optical. Maybe considering that most optical telescopes can't go below about 350 nm or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, and when redshifted into the optical, which for ground-based telescopes, the optical window is about 3000-7000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, the optical is about 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), but perhaps some can go lower. So if the observed wavelength is longer than 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), it's in the near-UV, which is barely transmitted. Wait, but the question is about the lower limit of the redshift, so the minimal z to have the Lyman alpha line observed in the optical.

Wait, perhaps the cutoff is 3000 Angstroms. So z=(3000/1216)-1 ≈ 1.467. So the minimal redshift is about 1.467, which is approximately 1.5. But the options given don't have 1.5. The closest lower option is
