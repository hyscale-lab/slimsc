Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetatesâ€”cis and trans versions.

First, I should remember what the structure of these compounds looks like. Acetates typically have an acetic acid group (OAc-) attached to another group. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, no, wait. Acetate is OAc-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester. So for propenyl acetate, it's CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, acetate is the ester where the acetic acid is the acid part. So the structure is the other way: the R group is attached to the oxygen, which is connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to an OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it becomes an ester, like ethyl acetate, it's CH3COOCH2CH3. So the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', where R is from the acid and R' is from the alcohol. Wait, no, wait. The ester is formed from an acid (RCOOH) and an alcohol (R'OH) to give RCOOR' plus water. So the acetate would have the structure RCOO-R', where R is the acetyl group (CH3CO-) and R' is the other group.

So propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl would have a double bond. Oh, right, propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but when attached as the ester group, it's OCH2CH=CH2. So
