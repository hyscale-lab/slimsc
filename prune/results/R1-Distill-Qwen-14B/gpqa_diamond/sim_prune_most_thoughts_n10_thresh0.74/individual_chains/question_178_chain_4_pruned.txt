Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's about determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants plays a big role in determining renormalizability.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think σ_{μν} is related to the spinor representation of the Lorentz group, but maybe I don't need that detail right now.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the mass dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in 4-dimensional spacetime because the action S is dimensionless, and S = ∫ d^4 x L, so [L]_M = 4.

So each term in L must have mass dimension 4. Let me look at each field's mass dimension.

The fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Wait, because in 4D, Dirac spinor fields have [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

Then σ_{μν} is built from the commutator of gamma matrices. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices, not fields), σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ, γ], which is zero. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute to the mass dimension.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like in electromagnetism or Yang-Mills. For electromagnetism, A^μ is a vector potential with mass dimension 1. The field strength tensor F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative gives mass dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2. But wait, F^{μν} is the same as F_{μν} but with indices raised, which doesn't change the dimension. So F^{μν} has [F]_M = 2.

Putting it all together, the term inside L_int is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So, we have:

[ψ̄]_M = 3/2

[σ]_M = 0

[ψ]_M = 3/2

[F]_M = 2

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has mass dimension: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F]_M =5.

But the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this. Since the entire term must have mass dimension 4, κ must compensate to bring the product down to 4. So:

[κ]_M + 5 =4 → [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, no. Wait, wait—no, because in the Lagrangian, the term is κ times the product, which is of dimension 5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the total dimension 4. Because 4 = [κ] + 5 → [κ] = -1. So that's the first part. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the condition is that the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤4/(number of spacetime dimensions) multiplied by something?
