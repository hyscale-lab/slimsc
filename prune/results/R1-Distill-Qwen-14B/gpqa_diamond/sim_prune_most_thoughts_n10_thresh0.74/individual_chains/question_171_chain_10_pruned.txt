Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine, and I need to figure out the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer for each substance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question gives six different benzene derivatives (substances 1-6) and asks about the para-isomer yield when each undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. I remember that in such reactions, the activating or deactivating groups on the benzene ring influence where the substitution occurs. Activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions, like ortho, meta, or para, while deactivating groups do the opposite or make the ring less reactive.

Wait, so in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can be either activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -NH2, -OCH3) make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH) make the ring less reactive and also direct the incoming groups. Also, the substituent's nature determines if they are ortho/para directors or meta directors.

Now, for each of the six substances, I need to identify the substituent and whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para or meta director. Then, based on that, determine the major product's isomer, especially the para isomer.

Let's list each substance with their substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is methyl (-CH3).
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: The substituent is ethoxycarbonyl (-COOEt).
3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent is chlorine (-Cl).
4) C6H5-NO2: The substituent is nitro (-NO2).
5) C6H5-C2H5: The substituent is ethyl (-C2H5).
6) C6H5-COOH: The substituent is carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Now, let's categorize each substituent:

1) Methyl (-CH3): It's an activating group. Alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. They are ortho/para directors. So, the incoming bromine will substitute at the ortho, meta, or para positions, but since it's an activating group, the major products are ortho and para. In monobromination, para would be a major product, but sometimes ortho can have more due to steric hindrance. Wait, but in the case of bromination, which is a bulky electrophile? Actually, bromine tends to add more to the para position when possible because the meta may have more steric issues, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, for substituents that are strong activating groups (like -OCH3), para is a major site. For methyl, which is a weaker activating group, I think the para isomer might be significant, but maybe the ortho is even more. Hmm, but wait, in the case of bromination, which is a big substituent, steric hindrance might make the para more favorable than ortho. Wait, no, bromine being added as an electrophile, but the substituent is the ring group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the directing effects. For methyl group, being an activating, ortho/para director. So the para position is a possible site for substitution. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, how much para product is formed?

I think that for substituents that are strong activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2), the para product is more than 50%, but for weaker activating groups like -CH3, the para might be a significant amount but maybe not the majority. However, the question is about the order of the weight fraction. So, I need to rank how much para is formed for each substituent.

Also, for deactivating groups, the ring is less reactive, so the substitution may be slower. But regarding the position, deactivating groups can be meta directors. Wait, nitro is a meta director. So, for nitro group, substitution would occur more at meta. Then, the para would be less. Similarly, for substituents like -COOH, which are deactivating and meta directors, substitution occurs more in the meta position. So, para isomer would be minimal.

So, let's go one by one:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl is activating, ortho/para director. So, the para isomer will be a major product. How much? Let me think, the methyl is a weak activating group. So, the ortho isomer tends to be the major product because of the activating effect and the possibility, but steric hindrance might make para more favorable. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the relative rates. For a substituent that is an ortho/para director, the para is more substituted than meta, but ortho is usually more substituted than para unless hindered.

Wait, no, for substituents that are activating and ortho/para directors, the para position may be more favored in some cases because the substituent is in a position that allows the bromine to add without too much steric hindrance. But I'm not entirely certain. For example, when the substituent is in the para position, the bromine can add more easily without being blocked, so the para product is more likely. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, in the case of monobromination, for a substituent like -CH3, the bromine can go into para, which is a major product. But sometimes, when the substituent is bulky, para may be more favored because the ortho would have more steric issues.

Wait, I think that for methyl group, the para isomer is more than the ortho because the ortho position is hindered by the substituent. So, the para isomer is the major product. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. For example, in toluene (methyl benzene), bromination under certain conditions can give more ortho or para, but I think the para is more favored here.

Wait, looking up in my notes: Toluene undergoes bromination to form a mixture of ortho, meta, and para-bromotoluene. The ortho isomer is actually the major product because the activating group directs there, and the para is next. But wait, wait, no. Because toluene is a weakly activating group. The para isomer is more formed than meta but less than ortho. So, the order
