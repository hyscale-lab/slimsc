Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to correct them as I go.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm would be the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. Let's compute that: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector must be normalized. So perhaps the given vector is actually a non-normalized state, and I need to normalize it first. Oh wait, the problem might just give the vector as is, and perhaps I can proceed without normalizing because the probabilities might end up being the same. Or maybe the problem has an error, but I'll proceed.

Wait, wait, maybe I should normalize it because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized. So let's compute the normalized state. The actual state vector is given by (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by [-1, 2, 1]. So each component becomes -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6). That's the state vector ψ.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let's look at their matrix representations.

Operator P's matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. And operator Q's matrix is diagonal:

First row: 1, 0, 0

Second row: 0, 0, 0

Third row: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The problem is asking for the probability of measuring P to be 0 and Q to be -1, when we measure P first, then Q.

Wait, no. The question says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?"

So the measurement sequence is first P, then Q. Oh wait, but the wording says "after the measurement of P", so the order is P first, then Q.

Wait, no, the question says, "measures Q just after the measurement of P." So P is measured first, then Q.

But when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the measured operator. So after measuring P, the state becomes an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then, measuring Q would be done on this new state.

So the process is:

1. Measure P on the initial state. If the result is 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Then, measure Q on this new state. The probability of getting -1 is computed based on this new state.

So the total probability is the product of two probabilities:

- The probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

- The probability of getting -1 when measuring Q on the state obtained after P's measurement.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the probability of first getting 0 for P, and then getting -1 for Q. So it's the product of these probabilities.

But to compute this, I need to find the eigenvectors of P and Q.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P's matrix:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Let me write this matrix as P.

We can compute the eigenvalues by solving det(P - λ I) = 0.

But for a 3x3 matrix, this might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by inspection, or look for patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors for P.

Wait, for P, let's think about possible eigenvectors.

Looking for vectors v = [a, b, c]^T such that P v = λ v.

So let's write the equations:

From the first component of P v:

(0 * a) + (1/sqrt(2) * b) + (0 * c) = λ a

This gives: (b)/sqrt(2) = λ a  --> equation 1.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2) * a) + (0 * b) + (1/sqrt(2) * c) = λ b --> equation 2.

Third component: (0 * a) + (1/sqrt(2) * b) + (0 * c) = λ c --> equation 3.

So equation 1 and equation 3 are similar.

From equation 1: b = λ a * sqrt(2)

From equation 3: (b)/sqrt(2) = λ c --> substitute b from equation 1: (λ a sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(2) ) = λ c → λ a = λ c → c = a (assuming λ not zero).

Now equation 2: (a)/sqrt(2) + (c)/sqrt(2) = λ b.

Substituting c = a, and b = λ a sqrt(2):

Equation 2 becomes: [a + a]/sqrt(2) = λ (λ a sqrt(2)).

Simplify left side: (2a)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) a.

Right side: λ^2 a sqrt(2).

So sqrt(2) a = λ^2 a sqrt(2).

Assuming a is not zero, we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2), getting 1 = λ^2 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. But wait, wait, because the matrix is 3x3, so there might be three eigenvalues. But perhaps one of them is zero? Because the trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, so sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if two are ±1, then the third must be 0.

Wait, let's check:

The trace of P is the sum of the diagonals: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So the sum of eigenvalues is 0.

If two eigenvalues are 1 and -1: sum is 0, so the third eigenvalue is 0.

Wait, that would make sense. So the eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, and 0.

So the possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of getting 0 for P. So we're interested in the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So for λ = 0, P v = 0*v → P v = 0.

So the equations become:

Equation 1: (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → b = 0.

Equation 2: (1/sqrt(2)) a + (1/sqrt(2)) c = 0 → a + c = 0 → c = -a.

Equation 3: (1/sqrt(2)) b = 0 → again, b=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is any vector where b=0 and c=-a. So the eigenvectors are of the form [a, 0, -a]^T. Let's choose a=1, then the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T. But we can also normalize it.

Wait, but for our purposes, perhaps we can find the normalized eigenvector.

So the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Wait, but perhaps the actual eigenvectors are different. Let me double-check.

Wait, when λ=0, the equations become:

Equation 1: b=0.

Equation 2: a + c = 0.

Equation3: b=0.

So yes, eigenvectors are [a, 0, -a]^T. So a can be any scalar. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional, but maybe I made a mistake because the algebraic multiplicity might be higher. Or perhaps I should re-calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors for λ=
