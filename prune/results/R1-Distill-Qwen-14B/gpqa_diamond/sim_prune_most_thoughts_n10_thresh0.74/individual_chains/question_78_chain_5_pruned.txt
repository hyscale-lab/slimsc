Okay, I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

So, the question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r at time t, given a moving charge q. The charge has a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at time t which is later than the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r.

I remember that for a point charge, the potentials are usually given in terms of the Coulomb potential and the magnetic vector potential. But wait, since the charge is moving, the expressions might involve some terms with velocity or perhaps some relativistic corrections.

Let me think about the scalar potential first. For a static charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point. But in this case, the charge is moving, so maybe there's some time delay or something else. Oh, wait, in the context of retarded potentials, I think the scalar potential isn't just the static one. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge in the context of retarded potentials might actually still be the same as the static case if we're considering only the scalar part. Or does it have a different form when considering the motion of the charge?

Hmm, wait. Another thought: the scalar potential V is given by an integral over the charge's history, but in the non-relativistic case, it's similar to the static case but with a retarded time. Wait, but the options don't seem to have any time dependence in them, except through the vector d and v.

Looking at the options, option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), same as static. Option C has V with a term involving d*c minus d·v in the denominator. Similarly, D has d*c plus d·v.

Wait, I think I might be confusing the form of the potentials. The scalar potential for a moving charge would involve the charge's position at an earlier time, but since the problem states that t > tr, we're looking at the potentials at a later time. 

Wait, but the standard
