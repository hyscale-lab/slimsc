Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see. The question is about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in that structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they typically undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So the product 1 would be an adamantyl diene? Or maybe a diene, but considering the structure, maybe it's a less substituted double bond? Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure. The structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3. When KOH is added, it would eliminate HBr twice, forming a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Brs are on 1 and 3. So when we eliminate two HBr molecules, each elimination would take H from adjacent carbons. So if we have Br on 1 and 3, perhaps the base abstracts a β-H from C2 or C4?

Wait, let me think. In 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons. So, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead. So when KOH is used, each dehydrohalogenation would form a double bond. Wait, but elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or wait, maybe it's a di-elimination, forming a conjugated diene? Because the two Brs are on 1 and 3, which are two bridgehead carbons. So when both Brs are eliminated, perhaps the structure becomes a cyclohexene-like ring within the adamantane structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but if KOH is the base, elimination would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the reaction. Wait, perhaps it's not an elimination but an SN2 substitution. But with two Br atoms, maybe they both undergo substitution. But wait, KOH is a strong base, and SN2 reactions are possible in such rigid structures, but substitution would form an alkoxide, but with excess KOH, perhaps the product is something else.

Wait, but IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone or ester? How?

Wait, another possibility: when two vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they can undergo a dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene, but perhaps under certain conditions, they might form a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of an oxide bridge, and then elimination of HBr to form an epoxide? No, that's different.

Wait, wait. Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, which could lead to the formation of an epoxide. But the IR doesn't show an epoxide's characteristic absorption, which is around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. The given IR is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alkene with an adjacent carbonyl, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps the base caused the formation of a ketone via some mechanism. Wait, how? Maybe under heat, the base could cause a elimination followed by some rearrangement. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 1H NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet of 2H. That might be an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. Because epoxide protons are typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but maybe in this structure it's more shielded. Or alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻1 suggests a carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How?

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination. So 1,3-d
