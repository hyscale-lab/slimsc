Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I need to find the energy at which the gamma rays' lifetime is limited by this process. Alright, let me think through this.

First, I remember that the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The process in question is gamma gamma annihilation: γ + γ → e+ + e-. So, high-energy gamma rays (let's call this γ1) are interacting with CMB photons (γ2) to produce these particles.

I think this has something to do with the photon-photon interaction cross-section and how it affects the mean free path of the gamma rays. The lifetime being limited suggests that the gamma rays are annihilating so quickly that their lifetime is determined by this interaction. So, the mean free time τ would be the age of the universe if the process is efficient enough.

Wait, the mean free time τ is related to the photon density and the cross-section. The formula for τ is 1/(n * σ * v), where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity of the gamma and CMB photon.

But I'm not super clear on the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the optical depth. The optical depth τ is n σ λ, where λ is the mean path. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the time it takes for the gamma ray to annihilate, and set that equal to the age of the universe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the standard approach for photon-photon annihilation is to calculate the interaction rate. The lifetime is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ would be n σ v, where v is the relative velocity. So τ = 1/Γ.

But let's get the formula straight. The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs, I think, has a certain dependence on the energy of the photons. I remember that the cross-section σ increases at higher energies because the photon-photon interaction probability goes up when their energies are higher. But the exact expression for σ might be needed.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is given by some formula. From what I recall, the cross-section depends on the product of the two photon energies. The exact expression might
