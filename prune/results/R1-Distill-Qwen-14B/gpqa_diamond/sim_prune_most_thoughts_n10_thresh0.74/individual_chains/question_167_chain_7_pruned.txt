Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>] / N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^(-2alpha^2)). Oh wait, right, because when you normalize a state like this, you square the coefficients and sum them, so the denominator comes from that.

The question wants me to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the given state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The relative entropy here would compare the given state's entropy to a Gaussian's. But wait, the problem says "using relative entropy measure", but I'm not exactly sure how that works.

I remember that for a state to be Gaussian, it needs to have a Wigner function that's Gaussian and other properties like that. But the calculation here must involve the density matrices of the state and a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but the state given here is a superposition of two coherent states, right? Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states
