Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So the astronaut's own time (proper time) is different from the time measured by someone else, like someone on Earth.

The question says the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long it will take from their perspective to reach Earth. The options are A to D, with A saying they die before reaching, which probably implies that the time is too long.

Wait, but wait. The astronaut's perspective is different. So I think we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. But how?

I remember the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this case, the astronaut is moving at 0.99999987c, which is v. So let me calculate gamma.

Let me compute v squared over c squared: (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately (since 1^2 is 1, and subtracting a bit). Let's see, 1 - (1 - 0.99999987)^2. Wait, maybe another approach. 0.99999987 is very close to 1. Let me compute it as (1 - delta)^2, where delta is 0.00000013.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 is approximately 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible. So approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 minus v²/c² is about 2.6e-7.

Then 1 minus v²/c² is 2.6e-7. So the square root of that is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 1.612e-3.5. Wait, because 1e-7 is 1e-3.5 squared. Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2, since 3.5 is 7/2.

Wait, sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is about 3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. So sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is approximately 5.096e-4.

So gamma is 1 divided by that, which is 1/(5.096e-4) ≈ 1962. So gamma is approximately 1962. So the time experienced on Earth would be time = distance / speed. Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem is about the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time on Earth. So the astronaut's clock runs slower from Earth's frame, but from the astronaut's frame, Earth is moving. Hmm, but I'm probably overcomplicating.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22, so they have about 128 years left on average. If the trip takes longer than that, they might die before reaching.

But
