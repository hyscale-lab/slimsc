Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that it's a peracid, commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. That's what happens in the first step of both reactions.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So their structures are different. Let's draw them out. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. For (E), the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure would be CH2CH2 with higher priority groups opposite each other. For (Z), the higher priority groups are on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene to form an epoxide, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product. Oh right! Because mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms across the double bond in a syn addition. So the configuration of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but after epoxidation, the next step is treatment with aqueous acid. Oh, right, that's acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide. The epoxide ring tends to open under acidic conditions. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. In acidic conditions, water is the nucleophile.

But wait, the ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions follows a specific mechanism. The more substituted epoxide oxygen is more likely to be protonated because it's more electrophilic. So the proton adds to the more substituted carbon, making the adjacent oxygen a better leaving group. Then, the water attacks the less substituted carbon? Or wait, the attack occurs in a way that leads to a more stable carbocation, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, maybe it's different.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. Because it's oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. Let me get the structure right.

Actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So each end is CH2CH2CH2CH2- on either side. So the epoxide formed would be symmetric only if the substituents on either side are the same. Wait, no, because (E) and (Z) would give different epoxide structures.

Wait, no, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers of the same molecule. So when you epoxidize each, the resulting epoxide structures might be different.

Wait, more precisely, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the two methyl groups (if any) on opposite sides. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So the substituents are CH2CH2CH2CH3 on either end of the double bond. So for (E)- configuration, the two CH2CH2CH3 groups are on opposite sides; for (Z), same side.

But wait, oct-4-ene is more symmetric because it's a straight chain. So when you epoxidize (E)-oct-4-ene, the resulting epoxide would have the same substituents on each carbon, but with the groups on opposite sides. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide with groups on the same side.

Wait, but when mCPBA epoxidizes the alkene, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a trans fashion. Wait, no, wait. The addition is syn. mCPBA adds the oxygen atoms across the double bond in a syn addition. So if the starting alkene is E, the substituents are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the two oxygen atoms add on the same face, which could result in a certain stereochemistry in the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product of each epoxidation.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the starting double bond is trans (E). When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds across in a syn fashion. So what happens? Let me imagine the double bond as CH2-CH2. In (E) configuration, the two CH2 groups on each end are on opposite
