Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me try to break down each part of the question step by step.

First, the question has three parts (A, B, C) with different reactants and conditions. I need to find the products for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and the conditions are NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, the base here is NaOEt, which would deprotonate the donor to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can easily form an enolate. The acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In a Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. The acrylate has a p-tolyl group on the alpha position (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). So, when the attack happens, the enolate adds to the double bond, and the oxygen from the carbonyl would get a negative charge, which would then pick up a proton.

Wait, but wait. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH. When it forms the enolate, the base abstracts a proton from the central carbon (the one adjacent to both carbonyls). So the enolate would be CH2- (with two negative charges?), but actually, it's a conjugate base with negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the acceptor, the structure would add the malonate part to the acrylate.

The product after the Michael addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha and beta carbons of the acceptor and the two carbonyls from the malonate. So, the product would be a tricarboxylate ester. Since the starting materials are methyl esters, the product would be a trimethyl ester.

The acrylate is E, so the configuration of the substituents on the double bond is trans. But after the addition, the geometry might not matter as much as the connectivity. The product would be a propanetricarboxylate maybe? Let me think. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the alpha position. Oh wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me correct: the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the 3-position is the p-tolyl. Wait, no, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, probably the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: so the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the middle carbon. Wait, the formula for methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would be the middle carbon: so the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: which would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait,
