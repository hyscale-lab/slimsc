Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All of them have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, specifically between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature when a planet is around a star. I remember it's something like T = T_star * (L / (16π²D²))^(1/4), but maybe a simpler version since the star is the same for all planets. Oh wait, the formula is often written as T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)), but wait, no. Maybe I should think differently. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Because the farther away a planet is, the cooler it will be. The formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out.

Wait, actually, the standard formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T_planet = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( (1) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( ( L / (16π² a²) ) )^(1/4)

But wait, that's for a more detailed case. Since all the planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so that part is 1. And since albedo is the same, that term is the same for all. So the key factor is the semi-major axis, a.

But in the question, we're given the orbital periods in a ratio. So, if the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, then the periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

But Kepler's third law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis. The law says that P
