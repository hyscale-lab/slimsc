Okay, so I've got this question about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a new quorum-sensing peptide was found in Lactobacillus acidophilus. The researcher treated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this peptide and observed the formation of a shmoo. I remember that the shmoo is a structure in yeast that's associated with mating. So when yeast cells form a shmoo, they're often preparing for conjugation, which is part of their mating process.

The main goal is to find out about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. To do this, they're using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS). ChIP is a technique that isolates DNA regions bound by specific proteins, but in this case, they're looking for proteins in the active chromatin regions.

The question is asking which complex's proteins will be least observed in the assay. The options are A to D, each a different protein complex.

Let me review each option:

A) Nucleosome histone complex: Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, made of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped. Active chromatin regions are typically more open, like euchromatin, so nucleosomes are definitely a part of the chromatin structure. So this complex's proteins should be present.

B) Pre-replication complex: This complex assembles during the G1 phase of the cell cycle to license replication origins. It includes proteins like Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm complex. I'm not sure how this ties into the shmoo formation. The shmoo is about mating, which might involve changes in gene expression, perhaps during the cell cycle. But I'm not certain if the pre-replication complex is active in the shmoo.

C) Pre-initiation complex: This is the complex that forms on the promoter region of a gene to initiate transcription. It includes RNA polymerase II, the general transcription factors (like TFIID, etc.), and other initiation factors. If the active chromatin in the shmoo is transcriptionally active, then these proteins should be present. So this complex's proteins should be observed.

D) Enhancer protein complex: Enhancers are regions of DNA that increase the transcription of genes. Proteins like transcription factors and mediator complex proteins bind to enhancers. I think that if the enhancer regions are active, their associated proteins would be part of the chromatin being precipitated.

Wait, the question is about which complex's proteins will be least observed. So looking for the one that's least likely to be present in the active chromatin of the shmoo.

The shmoo formation is primarily associated with the mating response. The key players here are the transcription factors like the Ste12 protein, which binds to the promoters of genes involved in the mating response. Additionally, the high occupancy transcription factor (HOT) proteins may be involved in binding to specific regions.

The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, which is a different process. Unless the treatment with the peptide induces S phase, which I don't think is the case here. The shmoo is a response to pheromones, leading to cell cycle arrest in G1 to prepare for mating. So replication wouldn't be active; thus, the pre-replication complex might not be present in active chromatin during the shmoo phase.

Alternatively, maybe the pre-initiation complex (C) would be present because genes are being transcribed. The nucleosome (A) is part of chromatin, so their histones should be there. Enhancer proteins (D) would be if the enhancers are active in regulating the gene expression for the shmoo.

So comparing the options, the pre-replication complex (B) is the least likely to be present in the assay because the cells are not in the S phase, and the shmoo is about gene expression for mating, not DNA replication. Therefore, their proteins wouldn't be part of the active chromatin in this context.


The question involves identifying which protein complex is least likely to be observed in the active chromatin of the shmoo formed in yeast treated with a quorum-sensing peptide. The shmoo is associated with the mating response, which involves transcriptional changes rather than DNA replication. 

- **Option A (Nucleosome histone complex):** Nucleosomes are fundamental components of chromatin, and active chromatin regions (euchromatin) are expected to contain histones. Therefore, proteins from this complex are likely to be observed.

- **Option B (Pre-replication complex):** This complex assembles during the G1 phase to license replication origins and is involved in DNA replication. Since the shmoo formation is associated with the mating response and cell cycle arrest in G1, DNA replication is unlikely to be active. Thus, proteins from this complex are the least likely to be observed.

- **Option C (Pre-initiation complex):** This complex forms on promoters to initiate transcription and is expected to be present in transcriptionally active chromatin, such as that associated with the shmoo. Therefore, proteins from this complex are likely to be observed.

- **Option D (Enhancer protein complex):** Enhancers are regions of DNA that regulate gene expression, and their associated proteins are likely to be present in active chromatin during the shmoo formation. Hence, proteins from this complex are also expected to be observed.

Given the context of the shmoo formation and its focus on transcriptional regulation rather than DNA replication, the pre-replication complex (B) is the least likely to be observed in the assay.

Answer: B
