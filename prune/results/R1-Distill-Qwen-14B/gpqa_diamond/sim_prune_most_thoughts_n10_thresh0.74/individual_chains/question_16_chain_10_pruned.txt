Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity, and I need to figure out how many of the given compounds are optically active. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through each compound step by step.

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it might have some sort of symmetry that makes it non-chiral despite having stereogenic centers, but I think that's more complicated. So my main focus is on whether each compound has any chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, no wait. Wait, the structure is: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, and a double bond, and two other substituents. Wait, wait, but the structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is: the molecule is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, but wait, butane is four carbons. So let me draw it:

The structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. Then, C2 has a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl), so the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then two CH2 groups on either side?

Wait, but the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one of the Hs on C1 with Cl. So C1 would be CHCl, double bonded to C2 (which is CH). But the compound is 2-methyl, so C2 has a methyl group. So C2 is CH(CH3). So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-
