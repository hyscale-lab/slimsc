Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent crystal planes. I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, that might be more specific. Alternatively, I remember that for cubic systems, it's simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, but rhombohedral isn't cubic, so I can't use the simple cubic formula.

Alternatively, maybe the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is d_{hkl} = a / √(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and α, β, γ are the angles between the lattice vectors. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal, so a = b = c. And all angles are equal, so
