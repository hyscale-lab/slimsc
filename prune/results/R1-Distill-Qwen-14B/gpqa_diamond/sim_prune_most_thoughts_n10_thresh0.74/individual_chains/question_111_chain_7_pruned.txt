Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to find the major products for each. The options are given, so I should work out each reaction and see which option matches.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK.

Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so I think this might be a Claisen condensation or some kind of aldol addition. Wait, the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is an ester. Oh, right, this sounds like a Michael addition or maybe a crossed aldol reaction.

Wait, Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks a beta, gamma-unsaturated carbonyl. So ethyl acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOEt. The cyclohexanone is the ketone. Could it be that the cyclohexanone is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the alpha position of the ester?

Alternatively, maybe the base deprotonates the cyclohexanone to form an enolate, which then attacks the alpha position of ethyl acrylate. Oh, but wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester; the enolate would attack the beta position, leading to a conjugate addition, which is the Michael addition.

So the cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl is at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). So when the enolate forms, the base (t-BuOK) will abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl. Where are the alpha positions? The carbonyl is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and perhaps any others adjacent.

Wait the structure is cyclohexanone, so the carbonyl is at one position. The molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1; positions 2 and 6 have substituents. So the possible alpha positions are C2 (next to the carbonyl) and perhaps C6. But C6 is a methyl group, so maybe the alpha hydrogen is at C2.

Wait, the enolate formation: the base abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl, which would be the hydrogen on C2. So the enolate would have a negative charge on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2.

Then, the enolate would attack the ethyl acrylate. Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate attacks at the beta position, which is the CH2 part next to the double bond. So the addition would occur there, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

But wait, what's the structure after the addition? Let me draw it out mentally. The enolate (from the cyclohexanone) has a negative charge on C2
