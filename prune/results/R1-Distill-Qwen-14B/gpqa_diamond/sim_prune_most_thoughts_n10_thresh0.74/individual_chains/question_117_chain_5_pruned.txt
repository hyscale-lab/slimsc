Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism happens when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, making it able to show optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound with substituents. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. At positions 2 on each ring, there are carboxylate groups (since it's a dicarboxylate, so each COO- is attached to a methyl group, making them esters). Also, the 6 positions have nitro groups.

Wait, since it's a biphenyl, the single bond between the two benzene rings allows for rotation. But wait, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that they can't be superimposed, could that lead to geometric isomerism or maybe optical isomerism?

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. But if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric, maybe it's a chiral center. Wait, but each benzene ring in biphenyl is attached via a single bond. So maybe the entire structure is chiral if the arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a carboxylate at position 2 and a nitro at position 6. So the substituents on each ring are in the 2 and 6 positions. Hmm, but each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So the arrangement is such that the molecule is symmetrical? Or not?

Wait, no. Because the substituents on each ring are in para positions relative to the connecting bond. So for the first ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. Wait, no, the 2 and 6 positions on a benzene ring are adjacent to each other? Or wait,
