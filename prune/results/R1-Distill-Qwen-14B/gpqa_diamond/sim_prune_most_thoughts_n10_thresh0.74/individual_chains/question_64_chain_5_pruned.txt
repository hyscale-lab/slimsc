Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what it's about.

So, the question is about two salts, A and B, which are mixed in equimolar amounts and heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes filled with different chemicals. The results are that tube 1 (with Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60g, tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) didn't change, and tube 3 (red-hot copper) gained 0.80g. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when salts are heated, especially without air, they can undergo thermal decomposition. The gases produced are probably some combination of CO2, H2O (as steam), maybe NH3 or other volatile substances. But since tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant and can absorb water, and it gained mass, that suggests that water vapor was present. Tube 3, with red-hot copper, likely reacted with a gas containing oxygen or something that can oxidize copper. The fact that tube 3's weight increased by 0.80g suggests the formation of CuO, so perhaps CO or another oxide-forming gas was present.

Wait, but the second tube, Ca(OH)2 solution, didn't change. That tube is supposed to absorb CO2, right? Because CO2 reacts with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the weight didn't change, that implies there was no CO2 in the gases. So, the gases after tube 1 don't have CO2, which means any CO2 must have been removed or not present.

So, the gases leaving tube 1 must have been something that didn't include CO2. But wait, tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs water. So, the initial gas after heating must have included water vapor. But since tube 2 didn't react, it suggests that any CO2 was already removed before reaching tube 2. Wait, no. Because the first tube would have absorbed water, perhaps. Let me think again.

So, the initial gas mixture passed through tube 1, which absorbed water. Then, the gas went to tube 2, which didn't react. So, the gas after tube 1 couldn't have had anything that would react with Ca(OH)2, which is CO2. So, maybe the original gas mixture had CO2, but it was completely absorbed by tube 1? No, because Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, not a CO2 absorber. So, CO2 would pass through tube 1 unaffected. Then, tube 2 would react with CO2, but since tube 2 didn't change, that means there was no CO2 in the gas after tube 1. Therefore, the initial gases couldn't have had CO2. So, what else could they have?

Wait, maybe the salts A and B decomposed into gases like NH3, H2O, and maybe some other gases. But let's think about the data.

The initial mass of the salt mixture is 7.20g. After heating, the gases passed through the tubes, and the only gas left was 2.24 L at standard temp and pressure (STP). Since 22.4 L is 1 mole at STP, 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So, gas C is 0.1 moles.

Let me break down the changes in mass:

- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60g. Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water. The reaction is Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, but more accurately, for every mole of H2O absorbed, the mass increases by 18g (since H2O is 18g/mol). So, the 3.60g increase would mean 0.2 moles of H2O (3.60 / 18 = 0.2). So, 0.2 moles of H2O were present in the gas mixture.

- Tube 3, with red-hot copper, gained 0.80g. The reaction here is likely 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C or something similar. Wait, but wait—another possibility is that CO2 gas is reacting with copper at high temp. But I think the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + C (carbon). Because CO is a reducing agent. Alternatively, if it's H2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H2O, but that might not fit. Wait, but the mass increase in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let me think about the possible reactions.

If the gas is CO, then the reaction is CO + Cu → CuO + C. The molar masses: CO is 28g/mol. For each mole of CO consumed, 1 mole of CuO (80g/mol) is produced. But wait, the mass change is the mass of CuO formed. So, the gain in mass is the mass of CuO minus the mass of Cu. Because Cu is initially present as Cu (probably in the form of CuO or another oxide?), but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

The reaction for CO: when CO reacts with Cu at high temperature, it forms CuO and carbon. The balanced equation is 2 Cu + CO → Cu2O + C. Alternatively, perhaps it's CuO + CO → Cu + CO2, but that's not applicable here because the copper is red-hot, and probably the gas is CO. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 Cu + CO → 2 CuO + C.

Wait, let's compute the mass change. Suppose the gas is CO. Let’s say n moles of CO reacted with Cu. The reaction would be:

CO + 2 Cu → 2 CuO + C

Wait, let me balance it properly. Let me take the reaction CO + Cu → CuO + C. Let's balance it:

CO + Cu → CuO + C.

Looking at each element:

Cu: 1 on each side.

O: 1 on each side.

C: 1 on each side.

So, the equation is balanced as CO + Cu → CuO + C.

So, for each mole of CO, one mole of Cu is consumed, and one mole of CuO and one mole of C are produced.

The mass change would be the mass of CuO produced minus the mass of Cu consumed plus the mass of C produced, but wait, because C is a product, but it's in solid form (since it's after passing through hot Cu, perhaps in solid form). So, the mass of the tube (which is a solid) would increase by the mass of CuO minus the mass of Cu consumed, plus the mass of C produced.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me compute the masses involved. Let's say m grams of CO reacted.

Molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol. So, n = m /28.

In the reaction, each mole of CO produces 1 mole of CuO (80g/mol) and 1 mole of C (12g/mol). But wait, the Cu comes from the tube. So, the mass change in the tube would be the mass of CuO formed plus the mass of C produced minus the mass of Cu consumed.

Wait, the initial tube has copper in some form. If it's metallic copper, then the reaction would consume Cu and produce CuO and C.

So, for each mole of CO:

CO (28g) reacts with Cu (64g) to produce CuO (80g) and C (12g).

So, the change in mass for the tube would be (80g +12g) -64g = 32g increase per mole of CO.

But in the problem, the tube gained 0.80g. So, 32g per mole → 0.80g is (0.80 /32) = 0.0
