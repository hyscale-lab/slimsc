Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on certain quantum numbers. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

First, the question states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So, the initial state is 1S0, which I think means the spin is S=0 because 1S0 implies (2S+1)=1, so S must be 0. The orbital angular momentum L is denoted by the spectroscopic notation; since it's S, that's L=0. And the J is 0, so the total angular momentum is zero.

Now, Pauli statistics require that the total isospin T, angular momentum S, and spin L of the final state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN) = 0. So, plugging into the equation, 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Let me rearrange that: S + L must be 1 mod 2, which means S + L is odd. So S and L must have opposite parity— one even, the other odd.

Wait, but wait. Wait, S is the total spin of the NN state. Wait, or is it the spin state? No, wait, the problem says that the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T is 0, so S + L +1 must be even, because 0 mod 2 is 0. So S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must add to an odd number. So, either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

But wait, the NN system after emission will have some spin and orbital angular momentum. So, let's think about the emission process. The initial state is 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, J=0. When they emit particle X, which has its own properties, the final state of NN must have certain quantum numbers.

Since X is emitted, the process must conserve angular momentum. So the initial angular momentum is zero (since J is 0), and the total after emission must also be zero. So the total angular momentum of the final state of NN plus the angular momentum of X must equal zero.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the total angular momentum is conserved. So the initial is J=0, so the final must have total J=0. The final state includes the NN state and the X particle. So the total angular momentum is the vector sum of their individual angular momenta. But this might get complicated, so perhaps I should look at the parity as well.

The problem also mentions that parity is conserved. The initial state has a parity which I should calculate. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L), where L is the orbital angular momentum. The initial state is 1S0, so L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The overall parity after emission should be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X, considering any orbital angular momentum they have relative to each other. Wait, but wait. Orbital angular momentum between the two comes into the parity. So the parity after emission would be parity_NN * parity_X * (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN in the final state and the emitted X.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The initial parity is (−1)^L_initial = (−1)^0 = +1. After emission, the final state is the NN in some state with L_final and the X particle. The total parity would be (parity_NN_final) * (parity_X) * (-1)^L_emission, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission process.

Wait, no. When a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum between the two (the NN and X) contributes to the parity. So the overall parity is (parity_NN_initial) * (parity_X) * (-1)^L_emission. But since parity is conserved, the initial and final parities must be the same. Wait, no, because the system is emitting a particle, so perhaps the initial parity is preserved, but the details are a bit tricky. Hmm.

Alternatively, the parity of the initial state (NN) is P_initial = (−1)^L_initial = (−1)^0 = +1. After emitting X, the final state is NN in state (T, S, L) and X with its own parity. The total parity is P_final = (−1)^(L_final) * P_X. But the parity should be conserved, so P_initial = P_final. So 1 = (−1)^(L_final) * (-1), because X has parity -1. So 1 = (-1)^(L_final + 1). Therefore, (-1)^(L_final +1 )= 1 → L_final +1 must be even → L_final is odd.

So L_final must be odd. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN in the final state is an odd integer. So L can be 1,3,5... etc.

But wait, let me check: P_initial =1. P_final = parity_NN * parity_X * (-1)^L_emission. But the emission process's orbital angular momentum is the L in the state of X. So perhaps the L in the term symbol of the final NN state is L, and the orbital angular momentum for X would be the
