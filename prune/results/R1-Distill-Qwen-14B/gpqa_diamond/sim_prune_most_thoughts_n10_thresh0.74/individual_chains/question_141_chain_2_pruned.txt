Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. Because benzene rings can't have two substituents on the same carbon. Oh wait, no, wait. Benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1-bromo would be at position 1, and then 2-d? Or maybe it's 2-dimethyl? Like 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the structure isn't clear. Wait, the actual structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or is it something else?

Wait, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene but I'm not sure about the 'd' part. Wait, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene with another substituent? Hmm,
