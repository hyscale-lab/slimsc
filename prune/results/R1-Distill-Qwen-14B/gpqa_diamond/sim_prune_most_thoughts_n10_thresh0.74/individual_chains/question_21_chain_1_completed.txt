Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and then some other concepts like tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. But let me think about the details.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The options are between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A, and between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

Starting with part A: which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. I think tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond from one atom to another, resulting in different structures. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, enol and keto forms are tautomers. So, does benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have tautomerism?

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic compound where the oxygen is in a ring structure. Wait, benzoquinone is O in the ring, like a cyclic dienone. Wait, no, benzoquinone is two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring? Or maybe it's a quinone structure, which is a cyclic diketone. So, like, O=C6H4=C=O? Hmm, no, I think benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions, so O=C6H4=C=O? Or maybe the ring has two double bonds.

Wait, benzoquinone is actually a quinone, which has a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, the structure is like a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as part of the ring, each in a carbonyl group. So, it's O=C-C6H2-C=O, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, the ring has two double bonds. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-cyclohexadienedione structure, which is benzoquinone.

Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires adjacent groups that can form a double bond. For instance, in a diketone like 1,3-diketones, enol tautomerism is possible. But in benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are conjugated in the ring. So, perhaps the structure is more rigid, making tautomerism less likely.

Wait, another thought: tautomerism would involve the shifting of a hydrogen and a double bond. So, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, three ketone groups. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Well, each ketone group is in a position that's conjugated, but are there hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups?

In 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at every other position. So, each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2- in a ring? Wait, no, because it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which would be a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl, meaning the adjacent carbons (positions 2,4,6) are each CH2 groups. So, positions 2,4,6 are CH2, and positions 1,3,5 are carbonyl carbons. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two hydrogens.

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, right? Because the hydrogen moves to the carbonyl oxygen, forming a double bond elsewhere. So, for example, in a diketone like 1,3-diketone, you can have enol tautomerism. But in this 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, perhaps each carbonyl has neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C in the ring, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps each position 1,3,5 is a carbonyl, so the ring is O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2-O=C-CH2 in a ring? Wait, no, because it's a six-membered ring. So, each of the three carbonyls is separated by a CH2 group. So, positions 1: O=C, position 2: CH2, position 3: O=C, position 4: CH2, position 5: O=C, position 6: CH2. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyls and three CH2 groups in between.

So, each carbonyl (C=O) is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 group has two hydrogens. So, for each CH2 group, each hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl. So, could tautomerism occur?

Wait, perhaps in each CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, a hydrogen can shift. But wait, if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, like in a 1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, right? Because position 2 is between 1 and 3, which are both carbonyls. So, the CH2 group in position 2 is between two carbonyls. So, in such a case, the CH2 could potentially lose a hydrogen and form a double bond, leading to a conjugated system.

Wait, but wait, when tautomerism occurs, you have a hydrogen moving from an adjacent carbon to the oxygen, forming a double bond. So, in this case, if a hydrogen from the CH2 between two carbonyls moves to one of the carbonyl oxygens, that would form a double bond in the chain. So, the structure would change from a single bond to a double bond, but in this case, maybe it's part of the ring.

Wait, but the ring is already conjugated with alternating double bonds? Or is it a fully saturated ring? No, because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups, each as C=O, but the ring itself would have single bonds. So, the ring would have three double bonds? No, that's not possible because a six-membered ring can't have three double bonds without being aromatic, but in this case, the ring isn't aromatic because it's a trione. Wait, perhaps the ring is fully conjugated with alternating double bonds, so the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is fully saturated except for the three carbonyl groups. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. So, the structure is a benzene ring (six-membered aromatic ring) with two oxygens in the ring as carbonyl groups, making it a quinone. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O? Or wait, it's more like O=C-C6H3-C=O, but arranged in a conjugated system.

In benzoquinone, each ketone is part of the ring's conjugated system. So, the molecule is fully conjugated, making it more stable. Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring. So, the adjacent carbons in the ring are each connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, perhaps the adjacent atoms don't have hydrogens available.

Wait, no. The benzene ring in benzoquinone would have the structure O=C-C6H2-C=O. Wait, no, it's a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. So, positions 1 and 4 are carbonyls. So, each of those carbons is double-bonded to O, and the adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6, and 3 and 5) are each CH groups. So, each of those CH groups has one hydrogen.

So, could those hydrogens undergo tautomerism? Let's see. A hydrogen on position 2 (CH) is adjacent to position 1 (C=O). So, perhaps the hydrogen can shift to position 1's oxygen, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But position 1 is already a carbonyl, so the double bond would lead to a different structure.

Wait, but in benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated. So, moving a hydrogen from position 2 to position 1's oxygen would form a structure like O=C-O-C=C-C6H? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's not possible because the ring is already conjugated, so the movement of a hydrogen would disrupt the aromaticity, making it less favorable.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize into another structure. But wait, in reality, I think that tautomerism is more common in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, like 1,2-diketones or 1,3-diketones, which can form enols. But in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are para to each other on the benzene ring, so they're not adjacent. So, perhaps tautomerism isn't possible here because there's no adjacent H to a carbonyl. Wait, but each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH in the ring, which has a hydrogen. So, maybe the H can shift.

Wait, the structure of para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups opposite each other. Each of those carbonyl carbons is attached to a CH group (since benzene has six carbons, two are O, the others are CH groups). So, the adjacent carbons to the carbonyl are CH. So, the CH groups have one hydrogen each.

So, could a hydrogen from a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl move to the oxygen, forming an enol-like structure? But wait, the ring is aromatic. If a hydrogen moves, would that break the conjugation? Maybe, but perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 has two hydrogens. So, maybe tautomerism is possible here, as each CH2 can lose a hydrogen and form a double bond. Wait, but that would require each CH2 to form a double bond with either the previous or next carbonyl group. Let's think: if a hydrogen shifts from a CH2 between two carbonyls, like position 2, then perhaps the structure would form a conjugated system with more double bonds.

Wait, but in the trione, the ring is already saturated except for the three carbonyl groups. So, the carbonyls are in the 1,3,5 positions, and the ring has single bonds elsewhere. So, if a hydrogen from the CH2 moves, it would form a double bond in the ring, but that would require breaking the single bond structure. Hmm, maybe that's possible, leading to some conjugation, but I'm not sure how stable that would be.

Alternatively, maybe neither of them can undergo tautomerism, but that's unlikely because the question says one of them does, and the other doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I should think about examples. For instance, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a compound known for keto-enol tautomerism. I remember that in 1,3,5-trione, the enol form is possible because each CH2 group is between two carbonyls. So, each CH2 can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond, leading to an enol structure. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

But benzoquinone, being a fully conjugated aromatic system, may not have the necessary hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups for tautomerism. Or perhaps benzoquinone does have tautomerism but I'm not aware of it.

Wait, another approach: tautomerism generally requires the presence of adjacent hydrogens to a carbonyl group. In the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH group. So, each CH has a hydrogen. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible, but in practice, is it?

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone is more stable and doesn't undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, let me think again. Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone. The structure is O=C-C6H3-C=O. So, each carbonyl is attached to a CH group in the ring. Each of those CH groups has a hydrogen. So, the possibility for tautomerism exists: a hydrogen could shift from the CH group to the carbonyl oxygen, forming a double bond in the ring. But wait, the ring is already conjugated. If the hydrogen shifts, does that disrupt the conjugation?

Wait, the structure after tautomerism would have a double bond where the hydrogen was. But the ring is already a conjugated system of double bonds. So, maybe the tautomerism isn't possible because it would disrupt the aromaticity. Alternatively, maybe it's possible but not favorable because the molecule is already aromatic.

In that case, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. So, the compound that does not show tautomerism would be benzoquinone (A = benzoquinone), making cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione the one that does show tautomerism. So, part A would have A as benzoquinone.

Wait, but the question is about which does NOT show tautomerism. So, if A is the one that doesn't, then in part A, it's either benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Hmm, maybe I should look up if these compounds undergo tautomerism.

Wait, I think benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism because the ring is fully conjugated and any tautomerism would disrupt the aromaticity. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups and CH2 groups in between, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism, meaning benzoquinone does not. So, for part A, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true. Let me think: in a 1,3,5-trione, each CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, so the H is adjacent to a carbonyl on both sides. That would make the H more acidic, so tautomerism is more likely. So, the 1,3,5-trione would undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, being a conjugated system, may not have the necessary H's because the adjacent positions are CH groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have tautomerism because the H's are not in a position to shift without disrupting the conjugation.

So, if A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, then A is benzoquinone. So, the options for part A would be either option B or D, because A would be benzoquinone.

Now, part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (or other forms of chirality, like allenes or planar chirality). So, if the compound has a stereogenic center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, let me write the structure correctly. The formula would be: O

The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's count. The carbon chain is:

- The central carbon (CH(OH)): attached to:

  - CH3 (methyl group),
  - COOCH3 (ester group),
  - OH (hydroxyl),
  - and the next carbon (which is connected to another carbon, but wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second carbon (CH(OH)).

Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- an OH group,
- and a hydrogen? Wait, no, the formula is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, so the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, Carbon 2 has four groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and a hydrogen. So, yes, Carbon 2 is a chiral center because it has four different groups attached: CH3, COOCH3 (ester), OH, and H. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester would be when both -OH groups are replaced by OMe (methyl ester groups). So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)CH2?

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, but wait, no. Dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, which is the same as MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me. So, the structure is O

MeOC-CH2-CH2-CO Me? No, wait, no. Fumarate is a trans-dicarboxylic acid, so the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Wait, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

CH2(COO Me)=CH(COO Me).

Wait, but that can't be. Let me correct. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me.

So, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each of which is connected to a COO Me group. So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COO Me? No, wait, the double bond is between the two middle carbons, each connected to a COO Me group.

So, the structure is CH2(COO Me)-CH2-CH2-COO Me? No, that's incorrect for fumarate. Fumarate has a double bond, so the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me.

Now, in this structure, each of the carbons in the double bond (the two CH groups) is connected to two COO Me groups. Wait, no. The structure is CH2(COO Me) on each end with a double bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the dimethyl ester would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, which is correct. So, the two central carbons are each connected to a COO Me group and a double bond between them.

So, each of these central carbons is connected to two identical groups: COO Me and the other central carbon via a double bond. Wait, no, each is connected to each other via the double bond. So, each of the central carbons (the two in the double bond) has two substituents: one COO Me group and one H.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me.

Each of the CH in the double bond is connected to a COO Me group and an H. So, each CH in the double bond has two substituents: COO Me and H, and the double bond. So, wait, each CH is connected to:

- One COO Me group,
- One H,
- And the double bond connecting to the other CH.

So, each of the CH groups has two substituents and two identical H's? No, wait: each CH has the COO Me group, one H, and the double bond. So, each CH is actually CH2? No, wait, no. Each of the two central carbons is CH, each attached to the COO Me group and a hydrogen. So, each is CH, with substituents of COO Me and H, and the double bond.

Wait, for each CH in the double bond, the substituents are COO Me, H, and the double bond. So, each CH has two substituents (COO Me and H) and a double bond. But for a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms. So, in this case, each CH has:

- One COO Me group,
- One H,
- And a double bond to the other CH.

Wait, this would make each CH have two substituents, but for stereoisomerism, we need a tetrahedral center, but in a double bond, the geometry is about the arrangement around the double bond.

Wait, but fumarate is a trans-dicarboxylic acid. So, the dimethyl ester has trans configuration across the double bond.

But does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let's see. The two central carbons each have:

- COO Me,
- H,
- and the double bond.

So, each has two substituents besides the double bond. Wait, but each CH in the double bond doesn't have four substituents; they have two substituents (COO Me and H) and two bonds in the double bond. So, each is a CH group, not a stereogenic center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but wait, if the double bond is between two carbons, each with two substituents, then the molecule can have E/Z isomerism, but not optical isomerism. Because optical isomerism requires a chiral center or another form of chirality (like a planar chiral center, but that's more complex).

So, dimethyl fumarate has E and Z isomerism (geometric isomerism) but not optical isomerism. Because the molecule isn't chiral; it doesn't have a chiral center. So, it can't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait another moment: can a compound with a double bond exhibit optical isomerism? Only if the double bond is part of a chiral system. For instance, allenes can have chirality if the substituents around the two double bonds are arranged in a way that makes the central carbon(s) chiral. But in this case, dimethyl fumarate's double bond is between two CH groups, each with a COO Me and an H. So, each of those CH groups is attached to two identical groups (COO Me and H) and the other CH via the double bond. So, each CH group is attached to two identical substituents, so they aren't chiral centers.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on each CH are COO Me and H. So, if the other substituents are the same on each side, then each CH is not a chiral center. So, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism. Then, which of the two compounds in part B shows optical isomerism?

The other compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together:

For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So, A = benzoquinone.

For part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, so B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, no. Because in part B, dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism, while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does. So, for part B, the correct option is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options, option B says B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me recheck the options.

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

So, according to my earlier conclusion, A is benzoquinone (so options B or D) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (so option B). So, the correct option is B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as described in the question.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond from one atom to another, resulting in different structural isomers. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This is a cyclic compound with a benzene ring and two ketone groups in para positions. The molecule is fully conjugated, and the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic system. Tautomerism is unlikely because the aromaticity would be disrupted, making it unfavorable.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring, with CH₂ groups between them. The CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls have hydrogens that can shift, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, this compound does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism, while **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CHOH) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes the compound capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₂(COOCH₃)=CH(COOCH₃). The double bond between the two carbons means the molecule has E/Z isomerism, but it does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism, while **dimethyl fumarate** does not.

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.
- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **B**, where A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

**Answer: B**
