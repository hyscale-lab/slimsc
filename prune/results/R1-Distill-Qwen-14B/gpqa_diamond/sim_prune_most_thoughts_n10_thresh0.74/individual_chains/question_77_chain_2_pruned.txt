Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two different reactions: one involving the Cope rearrangement and another that's a thermal process. The products are labeled A and B, and I have to choose which option (A, B, C, D) gives the correct major products.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

First Reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+.

BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. The starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an OCH2 group, which is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So the structure is something like OCH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2 attached to benzene.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let's parse that. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond at position 2. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2? Or wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with double bond between carbons 2 and 3, right? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-, but with a methyl substitution. Oh, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be: the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH(CH3)- ?

Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. No, wait, but-2-en has double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but double bond between 2 and 3. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- ?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

But-2-en-1-yl is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2

But with double bond at position 2, so:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-

Wait, no, but that's but-1-en-1-yl? I'm getting mixed up. Let's think: The butenyl group has four carbons. The numbering starts from the end where the substituent is attached. So but-2-en-1-yl would be the substituent attached at position 1, with double bond between 2 and 3.

So the structure is: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but the substituent is attached to the first carbon. So the group is CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

But wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So on the third carbon of the butenyl group, there's a methyl branch.

So the group would be: The butenyl starts at position 1, which is connected to the oxygen.

So position 1: CH2-O-

Position 2: double bond to position 3.

So the structure is: OCH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl.

Another approach: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-.

But with a methyl on carbon 3. So the chain
