Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's try to think it through. The question is about particles moving in a detector, their Lorentz factor, and how many reach the inner walls. 

Hmm, the problem says that when particles are collided, they produce new particles that decay quickly and move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

Wait, so right now, with a Lorentz factor of 20, one third (about 33.3%) of the particles make it. We need to find the Lorentz factor that allows two-thirds (66.7%) to reach the walls. I think the key here is the relationship between the particles' speed, their lifetime due to time dilation, and the distance they can travel before decaying.

So, ultra-relativistic particles have speeds very close to the speed of light. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So, higher gamma means the particles are moving closer to the speed of light.

But how does this relate to how far they travel before decaying? Oh right, the lifetime of the particles as observed in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame). So if a particle has a proper lifetime tau, in the lab it lives for gamma * tau.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is v multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame, which is v * gamma * tau. Since v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, we can approximate this as c * gamma * tau.

So the maximum distance D the particle can travel is D = c * gamma * tau. 

In the detector, the radius is 30 meters, so particles must travel 30 meters to reach the wall. So, the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether its lifetime allows it to travel at least 30 meters.

Wait, but the problem says that at a gamma of ~20, one third reach the walls. So, maybe the number that reach depends on some probabilistic factor related to their lifetime. Maybe the particles have a mean lifetime such that without any time dilation, only a certain fraction would make it. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the time it takes for them to decay, and how much distance they cover on average.

Let me think. The average speed is v ≈ c, so the time it takes to reach the wall is t = R / v ≈ R / c. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab lifetime is gamma * tau. If the particle decays before reaching the wall, it won't make it. The probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t is the probability that it reaches the wall.

So, the probability P is the probability that gamma * tau > t. Which is the same as tau > t/(gamma). Or, rearranged, tau > R/(gamma c).

Wait, but wait. The proper lifetime is fixed. So the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall depends on whether gamma * tau is greater than the time it takes to reach the wall, t.

Wait, if the particles are created at the center, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(v). Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c) = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1e-7 seconds. 

But tau is the proper lifetime. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t is P = probability that gamma * tau > t. Which is the same as tau > t/(gamma). 

Wait, but how does that translate to the number of particles that reach the wall? If the decay is exponential, like N(t) = N0 e^{-t/tau}, then the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^{-t/(gamma tau)}. So the probability of reaching the wall is e^{-t/(gamma tau)}.

Hmm, but the given situation is that at gamma=20, one third (approx 0.333) reach the wall. So, 0.333 = e^{-t/(20 tau)}.

Wait, but t is R/(v), which is approximately R/(c), since v≈c. So, substituting t ≈ R/(c), the equation becomes 0.333 = e^{ - (R/(c)) / (20 tau) }.

Let me plug in the numbers. R is 30 m, c is 3e8 m/s. So R/(c) is 30/(3e8) = 1e-7 seconds. 

So, 0.333 ≈ e^{ - (1e-7) / (20 tau) }.

Taking the natural log on both sides: ln(0.333) ≈ - (1e-7)/(20 tau).

ln(1/3) is about -1.0986. So,

-1.0986 ≈ - (1e-7) / (20 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 ≈ (1e-7) / (20 tau).

Wait, that can't be right because that would give tau in terms of 1e-7/(20 * 1.0986) ≈ 1e-7 / 22 ≈ 4.5e-9 seconds. Let me compute it:

(1e-7) / (20 tau) = 1.0986

So, 1e-7 = 20 tau * 1.0986

=> tau = (1e-7) / (20 * 1.0986) = 1e-7 / (21.972) ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds.

Wait, but that's the proper lifetime. Now, we need to find what gamma would give P = 2/3. So, 2/3 ≈ e^{- t/(gamma tau) }.

Wait, but t is R/(v) ≈ R/(c) =1e-7 s. So,

2/3 ≈ e^{ - (1e-7) / (gamma tau) }.

Take the natural log:

ln(2/3) ≈ - (1e-7) / (gamma tau).

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 ≈ - (1e-7) / (gamma tau).

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 ≈ (1e-7) / (gamma tau).

We can solve for gamma:

gamma tau = (1e-7) / 0.4055 ≈ 2.465e-7.

But we know from the first situation that gamma was 20, and tau was approximately 4.55e-9 seconds. Let's compute gamma tau for gamma=20 and tau=4.55e-9:

20 * 4.55e-9 = 9.1e-8.

But in the first case, the probability was 1/3, which corresponds to gamma tau being such that (1e-7)/(gamma tau) was equal to ln(1/3) as we saw. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Wait, maybe instead of going through the proper lifetime, there's a ratio we can use. Because the only variable here is gamma. Let me think.

From the first case: P1 = 1/3 = e^{- t/(gamma1 tau)}.

From the second case: P2 = 2/3 = e^{- t/(gamma2 tau)}.

We can take the ratio of these two equations.

ln(P1) = - t/(gamma1 tau)

ln(P2) = -t/(gamma2 tau)

Subtracting the two equations:

ln(P1) - ln(P2) = [ -t/(gamma1 tau) ] - [ -t/(gamma2 tau) ]

= t/(gamma tau) [ 1/gamma2 - 1/gamma1 ]

But wait, let me compute ln(P1) - ln(P2) = ln(P1/P2).

So,

ln( (1/3) / (2/3) ) = ln(1/2) ≈ -0.6931.

On the left side, it's equal to t/(gamma tau) [ 1/gamma2 - 1/gamma1 ].

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write the equations again.

Equation 1: ln(1/3) = -t/(gamma1 tau)

Equation 2: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 tau)

So,

Equation1: ln(1/3) = -t/(20 tau) → because gamma1 is 20.

Equation2: ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma2 tau).

Let me express equation1 as:

t/(20 tau) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

So, t/(20 tau) = 1.0986.

From equation2:

t/(gamma2 tau ) = - ln(2/3) ≈ 0.4055.

So, from equation1, t/(20 tau) = 1.0986 → t/tau = 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

From equation2, t/(gamma2 tau) = 0.4055 → t/tau = gamma2 * 0.4055.

But from equation1, t/tau is 21.972. So,

21.972 = gamma2 * 0.4055 → gamma2 = 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.16.

Looking at the options, option A is 54 and option B is 68. So the closest is 54.

Wait, let me compute that division more accurately.

21.972 divided by 0.4055.

Let me compute 0.4055 * 54 = 0.4055 *50=20.275, 0.4055*4=1.622 → total 21.897. Hmm, which is very close to 21.972. So 54 would give us 21.897, which is just a bit less than 21.972. So maybe the actual gamma is about 54.16, so the nearest option is A)54.

So the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetime, their Lorentz factor, and the distance they travel. The key equations are:

1. **Distance traveled**: The maximum distance a particle travels before decaying is given by \( D = c \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

2. **Probability of reaching the wall**: The probability \( P \) that a particle reaches the wall is related to the ratio of the time it takes to travel the detector's radius \( R \) to its lifetime in the lab frame. For an exponential decay process, \( P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)} \), where \( t \approx R / c \).

### Given Data:
- Detector radius: \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \).
- Speed of light: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).
- At \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third (\( P = 1/3 \)) of the particles reach the wall.

### Step 1: Relating \( \gamma \), \( \tau \), and \( P \)
From the given data, at \( \gamma = 20 \), the probability \( P = 1/3 \). Using the formula \( P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)} \), we have:

\[
\ln(P) = -\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Substituting \( t \approx R / c = 30 / (3 \times 10^8) = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \), we get:

\[
\ln(1/3) = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \tau}.
\]

Since \( \ln(1/3) \approx -1.0986 \), solving for \( \tau \):

\[
\tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Finding the new \( \gamma \) for \( P = 2/3 \)
For the new probability \( P = 2/3 \), we use the same formula:

\[
\ln(2/3) = -\frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\gamma \tau}.
\]

Since \( \ln(2/3) \approx -0.4055 \), we solve for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{\tau \cdot 0.4055}.
\]

Substituting \( \tau \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{(4.55 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 0.4055} \approx 54.16.
\]

### Step 3: Selecting the closest option
The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately \( \gamma \approx 54.16 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **54**.
