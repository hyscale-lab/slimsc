Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each.

Alright, let's start with reaction A. The compound given is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. Wait, THF is a solvent, right? KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. And then H+ is probably an acid workup.

So, what's the structure of the starting material? Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—in this case, the spiro atom is the oxygen since it's an alcohol. The formula is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro part is a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring, I think. Wait, no, the numbers are in brackets, so spiro[3.5]non means that the non- part is the total carbon count. Spiro means two rings connected by one carbon. So, the main chain is 9 carbons (non), but split into two rings: one 4-membered and one 6-membered? Or wait, wait, the formula for spiro is that the numbers in brackets are the number of carbons in each ring minus one. So, [3.5] would mean one ring has 3 (so 4 carbons including the spiro) and another has 5 (6 carbons including the spiro). Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the spiro system is where two rings share a single atom, the spiro atom. The numbers inside the brackets are the number of carbons in each bridge. So, spiro[3.5]non would have a 3-carbon bridge and a 5-carbon bridge, making the total carbons 3+5+2 (the spiro and bridgehead) — wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, regardless, the starting material is a spiro compound with a vinyl group (the 1-vinyl part) and an enol (the 1-ol being the hydroxyl group, which is at position 1, so adjacent to the vinyl group). So
