Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, I remember that potentials in quantum mechanics often lead to different types of equations, like the harmonic oscillator or perhaps something else.

So the potential here is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, that's in polar coordinates, right? I think I can separate this into radial and angular parts. Let me think about how potentials in polar coordinates are handled. Oh, right, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates can be separated into radial and angular parts if the potential depends on r and θ in a certain way.

Let me try to rewrite the potential. V(r,θ) can be expressed as (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, because 1 + 3 cos²θ is 1 + 3 cos²θ, which I can maybe express in terms of multiple angles. Oh wait, 3 cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, 3 cos²θ becomes (3/2)(1 + cos2θ). So then the potential becomes (1/2)kr² [1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ)].

Wait, let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)kr², and the second part is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So substituting 3 cos²θ as 3*(1+cos2θ)/2, it becomes (3/2)*kr²*(1 + cos2θ)/2? Wait no, maybe I should factor it differently. Let me recast the original potential.

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Then, replacing cos²θ with (1 + cos2θ)/2, we have 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. So the term inside the
