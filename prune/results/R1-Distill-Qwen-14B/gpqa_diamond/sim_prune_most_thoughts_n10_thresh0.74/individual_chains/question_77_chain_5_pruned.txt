Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to wrap my head around some of these reactions. Let's see what it's about.

The question talks about two different rearrangements. The first one involves a Cope rearrangement, I think. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it's reacted with BuLi followed by H+. The second part is another rearrangement with a pretty complex starting material and heat, leading to product B. Then I need to choose the correct major products from options A to D.

Let's tackle the first part first. The starting molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, breaking that down. The benzene ring has a substituent which is a (oxy)methyl group attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl chain. So that structure is like benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2 or something like that? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out mentally. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on the 3rd carbon. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, and 3-methyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-. So the substituent is O-CH2 attached to that. Wait, the full substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2? No wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the 1-position. So the substituent would be O-CH2 attached to the butenyl group.

Wait, maybe it's O-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, because but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So, the substituent is O
