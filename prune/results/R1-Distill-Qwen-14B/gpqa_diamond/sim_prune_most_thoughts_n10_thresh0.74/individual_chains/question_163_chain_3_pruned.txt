Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong monobasic acid. They give me the mass of Fe(OH)3 as 0.1 grams and the total volume as 100 cm³. I need to find two things: the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have in moles. To do that, I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16 +1), and there are three of them. So total is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.359e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a strong acid, what happens? I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with a strong acid. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 will need 3 moles of H+ (from the strong acid) to dissolve completely. So, the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, moles H+ needed = 3 * 9.359e-4 ≈ 0.0028077 mol.

But wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. Monobasic means it provides one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So, the concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. To find the volume of acid needed, I can use the formula:

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranged, volume = moles / Molarity.

So, volume = 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028077 liters. To convert to cm³, that's 28.077 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation because I'm probably missing something.

Wait, oh right, because the problem says "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." So, the acid must at least neutralize all the Fe(OH)3. So, yes, 28.08 cm³ would be the volume needed. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05, which is very close, so that's probably the right volume.

But wait, what about the solution's pH? That's the second part. The pH
