Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So each state has a certain energy, and I multiply e^(-βE) for each state and add them all up.

But wait, the system has three spins, each can be +1 or -1. So how many possible states are there? Each spin has two options, so 2^3 = 8 states total. Yeah, that's right.

I think I should list all possible states and calculate E for each. Then sum up the e^(-βE) terms.

Let me think about how each state contributes. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Maybe I can group them based on the number of pairs that are aligned or something.

Alternatively, I can think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote this sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So for each state, E is -J times H, so the exponent in the partition function becomes exp( β J H ), because -β E = β J H.

So the partition function Z = sum_{all states} exp(β J H).

So I need to find all possible values of H and how many states correspond to each H.

Let me think about what H can be.

H is the sum of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, because each S is +1 or -1.

Wait, no. If S_i and S_j are the same (both +1 or both -1), their product is +1. If different, product is -1. So each S_i S_j term is ±1. So the sum H is the sum of three terms, each ±1.

So H can range from -3 to +3, since each term contributes +1 or -1. Let's see all possible H values.

Wait, but can H actually take all the
