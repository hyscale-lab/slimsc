Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots affecting its temperature. Then, they're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, and how that ratio changes when the star has spots.

Alright, let's break down the given information first. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So spots are causing the temperature to decrease.

Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, right, the spots are cooler regions. So when spots cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. But in this case, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. Wait, noâ€”wait, the Teff is the effective temperature. So the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The star's luminosity is related to its radius and effective temperature. But wait, the question is about the photosphere's temperature when spots are present. 

But the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the spots are making the star emit less total flux, hence a lower effective temperature. But the photosphere itself is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions? Or does the Teff now refer to the average? Hmm, but the problem states that when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So I think in this context, the effective temperature is the average, or perhaps the blackbody emission is considered as such. But for the purposes of the problem, I think the relevant temperature for each region is considered.

Wait, no. The spots are cooler regions, so the overall effective temperature is a weighted average. But when the star has spots, the photosphere isn't all at the same temperature. So perhaps the problem is considering the temperature of the unspotted regions as 6000 K, and the spotted regions as some
