Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials A and B that lead to the given products when treated with different reducing agents. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

The problem states that two reactions were done. In the first reaction, compound A was treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In the second reaction, compound B was treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they might have different selectivities. Oh right! LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's also a hydride source. BH3 is typically used in the formation of alkenes through hydroboration reactions. Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, when you have a ketone and you use a reducing agent, you typically reduce the carbonyl group.

Wait, but in this case, the products are tetrahydro pyran-2-one derivatives. Let me think about how that's formed. Oh, wait! I think that when you reduce a cyclic ketone, you might get a diol, but wait, the product is a tetrahydropyranone. So maybe the starting material isn't a cyclic ketone. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction would form something else.

Wait, another angle. Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal or something? No, wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So the product is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone group. So it's a cyclic ether with a ketone, maybe.

Wait, but how do you form that from a starting material? Let me think about the reduction steps. Maybe the starting materials are lactones, which upon reduction would open up.

Wait, another possibility: the starting materials could be alpha-hydroxy esters. Because when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. But wait, no, the product is a cyclic structure.

Alternatively, think about the possibility of the starting material being a cyclic ketone with some substituents. Oh, wait a minuteâ€”maybe the starting material is a bicyclic compound or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups like ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. BH3, on the other hand, is commonly used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition to alkenes. But wait, wait, BH3 is sometimes used in the reduction of esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. Hmm, no, wait, BH3 is more about adding to double bonds, but when used in a reduction, perhaps in a situation where the carbonyl is activated.

Wait, wait, wait. Another approach. Let's look at the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure of this compound is a pyran ring (6
