Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, the problem is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases, and we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between those levels.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, and ΔE is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. So, the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots divided by (n2/n1)_with_spots.

But wait, how does the temperature change affect this? The spots are cooler regions, but the overall photospheric temperature has changed, right? The effective temperature of the star without spots is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, wait. The effective temperature is the overall temperature measured from the star as a whole. But when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler. So the star's photospheric effective temperature, which is what's measured as Teff, changes from 6000 to 5500 K.

So the problem is essentially about how the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels changes when the temperature of the photosphere changes from 6000 K to 5500 K. So the ratio R is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that matters directly for this problem. Maybe it's just extra info.

So, the ratio when there are no spots is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), where T1 is 6000 K. When there are spots, R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)), T2=5500 K.

The question is, what
