Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, I think. Oh wait, the phase shifts are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. And the energies are 50 MeV electrons. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over the Legendre polynomials multiplied by exponentials of the phase shifts. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

Oh right, the general formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ]

But wait, the imaginary part is what we're after. So maybe I should look at the imaginary component of this expression. Also, since the problem asks for the direction along the incident beam, which I think is θ=0 degrees because the beam is the initial direction.

Wait, no. Wait, when you're looking along the incident beam direction, that's when θ=0. Because in scattering, θ is the angle between the initial direction and the scattered direction. So at θ=0, the particle is scattered along the same direction as the incident beam. But in that case, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0,
