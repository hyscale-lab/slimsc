Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electric potential energy calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just focus on electric potential energy.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. Hmm, I think that means the 13th is at the origin, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from it. So, the system is a central charge with 12 others surrounding it, each at radius 2 meters.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right! The potential energy of a system of charges. I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions while considering the potential due to the others.

But wait, there's a formula for the potential energy of a configuration of point charges. I think it's U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) * Σ Σ (q_i q_j / r_ij), where i < j. So, for each pair of charges,
