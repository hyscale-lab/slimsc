Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are A to D, each a different compound.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. I remember that molecular ions can sometimes form even and odd isotopic peaks. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35, but there's also a small abundance of 37Cl, about 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%. So if the molecular formula includes a chlorine atom, the molecular ion peak could split into two peaks due to the different isotopes.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156. Let me think about the possible molecular formulas. For example, if the formula includes Cl, like C8H5ClO2, which would have a molecular weight of (12*8)+(5*1)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 96 +5 +35.5 +32 = 168.5. Wait, that's way higher than 156. Hmmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's see: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would make sense if the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, but wait, the exact mass would be 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156, so perhaps there's a loss or something else. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C9H10O2 without Cl, but then where does the 358 peak come in?

Wait, the other peak is at m/z 158, which is 2 mass units higher than 156. This could be due to isotopic peaks. If the molecular ion is 156, and the next peak is at 158, that's a difference of +2. So that might suggest the presence of chlorine, because Cl has a natural abundance of about 25% for the 37Cl isotope. So the M peak is at 156 (with 35Cl), and M+2 is at 158 (with 37Cl). But in the mass spec, the M is at 100%, and M+2 is at 32%, which is roughly a quarter of the M. That makes sense because 37Cl is about 24.5% abundant. So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl atom.

So the formula is likely C7H5ClO2. Let's check the molecular weight again: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, but wait, the exact mass would be 156.5, which would round to 157? Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H7ClO2. Let's calculate: 8*12=96, 7*1=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total is 96+7=103, 103+35.5=138.5, +32=170.5. That's too high. So that's not matching.

Wait another approach. Let's look at the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is a broad peak, maybe from an -OH group or an amide N-H. But more likely, an -OH, since there's a broad peak. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) appear. 1720 is a bit high for a ketone, which is usually around 1700-1750. Esters and carboxylic acids have carbonyl around 1700-1750. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the O-H stretch would be very broad around 2500-3300. But in the IR here, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a bit lower than usual for O-H. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde's O-H, but aldehydes have a peak around 2820 and 2720 from the -CHO C-H stretch. Wait, the 3500-2700 cm^-1 in the IR could be an O-H stretch, but also possibly an N-H stretch. But the presence of a broad peak in that region is more indicative of O-H, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. However, looking at the 1H NMR data, let's see.

The 1H NMR shows a peak at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very downfield shift. Common for an aldehyde proton (which is around 9-10 ppm), but a carboxylic acid proton is even more downfield, like 10-12 ppm. But wait, the proton in a carboxylic acid is actually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding, but in the NMR here, it's a singlet. Hmm. Alternatively, if the proton is an aldehyde, that would be around 9-10 ppm, but 11 is a bit high. Unless it's something else.

Another possibility is an aromatic -OH, but those are usually around 5-7 ppm, but again, maybe in some situations they can be downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenol, but phenols typically have protons around 5 ppm or so. So maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility is a ketone. No, because the carbonyl is at 1720, which is in the ketone range. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, a ketone C=O is about 1700-1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR. So IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which could be a ketone or an ester or aldehyde.

Looking back at the 1H NMR. The peak at 11.0 ppm is a singlet, so it's likely an exchangeable proton, like an -OH or an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, maybe it's an -NH proton? But if it's a secondary amine or something, but the IR didn't show a strong peak in the N-H region. Alternatively, perhaps the 11.0 ppm is a carboxylic acid proton? But in the IR, the peak at 1720 cm^-1 might not be a carboxylic acid because the C=O in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 but can vary. Also, the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch in the 2500-3000 region, which is more typical for carboxylic acids. Instead, here the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a very broad range. It could be an O-H stretch, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300, very broad. But in this case, the peak is from 3500 down to 2700, which is a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde's C-H stretch. Aldehydes have two strong peaks around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1, which are usually sharp. But the broad peak in the IR from 3500 to 2700 might include that. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol's O-H, but that would usually have a broad peak in the 3200-3600 region, not down to 2700.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is due to an aromatic ring with some substituents causing a strong absorption. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR again: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). Let's think about the other peaks. 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are likely aromatic protons. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions.

Wait, let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. One substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (since the IR has a carbonyl). So maybe a nitro group? Or Cl? Or a carbonyl group.

Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene, like para-substituted benzoic acid, or para-substituted benzaldehyde, or maybe a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure is a benzene ring with Cl and COOH groups in para positions.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which would have Cl and COOH in ortho positions.

Option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that's a benzene ring with Cl at position 3, OH at position 2, and aldehyde at position 1? Or maybe it's arranged differently.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate. That would be OCl-CO-O-Ph. Or more accurately, the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph.

Wait, let's think about each option's spectral data.

Starting with the NMR:

The two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm suggest two sets of two protons each, likely in a para-substituted benzene. So if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would couple as two doublets, each
