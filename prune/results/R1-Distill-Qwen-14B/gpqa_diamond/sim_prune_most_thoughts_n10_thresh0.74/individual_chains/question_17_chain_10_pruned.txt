Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the setup is that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. We're told that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, okay, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The stability constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the formula for the Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. Right, so the stability constant K is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = K.

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Now, because K is so large (5e10), the dissociation of the complex should be minimal. But I can't just ignore it entirely, because the question is specifically asking about the free calcium ion concentration.

So let's think about this. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x because each mole of CaEDTA²− that dissociates produces one mole of each. But wait, no, because initially, the EDTA is all bound into the complex. So the initial concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are zero, but when some of the complex dissociates, let's say 's' moles per liter dissociate.

Wait no, no. Wait, actually, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when some of it dissociates, the concentration of the complex decreases by 's', and each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− increases by 's'. So:

CaEDTA²−: 0.
