Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since both are moving along the horizontal axis but opposite directions, their collision is head-on. So the system's total momentum must be conserved.

Wait, electrons and positrons have equal mass, right? So an electron has charge -e, and a positron +e. But for their annihilation, mass is the same. But since they're moving towards each other, their momenta will be in opposite directions.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is greater than or equal to 1. So for the electron, gamma is 4. The positron has gamma 2.

I think the first thing to do is compute their relativistic momenta. Because when they annihilate, the total momentum must be carried by the photons. Since the photons are massless, their momentum is E/c each, and their directions are given.

But wait, the photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy E
