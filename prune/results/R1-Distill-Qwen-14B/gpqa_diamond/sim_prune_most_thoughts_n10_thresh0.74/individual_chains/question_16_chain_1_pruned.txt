Okay, so I've got this question in front of me, and I need to figure out how many of the given compounds are optically active. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through each compound step by step.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chirality, which means it has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, some compounds can be chiral without having a chiral center, like in the case of allenes or compounds with a plane of symmetry. But I think most of these are chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Structure: The molecule is CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, butene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)-something? Wait, maybe I should sketch it.

But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2. Oh wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So C1: Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would be CH2=CHC(CH3)H? Wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro, so Cl is on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, that would be 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. So the molecule is (Z) configuration. But the key is whether any carbon
