Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about dienes reacting with mCPBA and then aqueous acid, and then looking at the products through HPLC. Hmm. I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group to alkenes.

So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both reactions go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, what's the outcome of each reaction? Let me think. When an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

For (E)-oct-4-ene: The double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. I think mCPBA adds via an electrocyclic mechanism, which is stereospecific. Oh wait, when mCPBA adds to a trans double bond, what happens? Let me visualize the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH... Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait no, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH2
