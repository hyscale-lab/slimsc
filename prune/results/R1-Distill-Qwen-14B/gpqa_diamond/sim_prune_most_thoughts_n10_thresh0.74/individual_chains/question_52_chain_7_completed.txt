Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about a star whose properties change when it has dark spots. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. But how does that affect the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels? I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E is the energy of the level, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem mentions the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. We're looking for (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots, which is the factor of change.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the ratio R = n1 / n2.

So, R = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels. But if E2 > E1, then as T decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. So R decreases when T decreases. That matches the observation given in the problem.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet. The energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. 

So first, calculate the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters or 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3.0e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, I might need the energy in terms of eV because atomic energy levels are often in electron volts. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So converting ΔE: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high for Ti. Titanium's ionization potential is about 6.996 eV, but maybe the transition is a higher energy one. But I might be wrong; perhaps it's a neutral to neutral transition. Anyway, moving forward.

So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE / (k T) ). Let me compute this for both temperatures, 6000 K and 5500 K.

Wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K. So, because ΔE is in eV and T is in K, this makes the units work out.

So for T1 = 6000 K:

ΔE / (k T1) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.56 / (0.517) ≈ 16.56.

So exp(-16.56) is a very small number. Let me calculate it:

exp(-16.56) ≈ 4.6e-8.

Similarly, for T2 = 5500 K:

ΔE/(k T2) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.56 / (0.4739) ≈ 18.06.

So exp(-18.06) ≈ 1.5e-8.

Wait, but wait a second. The ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller, so R decreases. That matches the observation.

Now, the ratio R when no spots (R1) is (n1/n2) when T=6000 K, and R2 when T=5500 K.

So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We need the factor F = R1/R2.

So F = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you have exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a - b), but in this case, the exponents have negative signs.

Wait, let me compute:

F = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)} )

Wait, because:

-ΔE/(k T1) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So F = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which can be written as exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) )

Wait, maybe I should compute this directly.

Let me compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4, 1/6000 ≈1.6667e-4. So the difference is (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approximately 99309 K.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

ΔE is 8.56 eV. k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99309 K.

So (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) ) = 99309 K * (1.513e-5 K^-1) ) ≈ 99309 * 1.513e-5 ≈ 1.502.

So F = exp(1.502) ≈ e^1.502 ≈ 4.49.

Wait, wait, wait. Because (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive, so ΔE/(k) times that is positive, so F is exp(positive number). So F is about e^1.5 ≈ 4.48.

So the factor F is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because that's a critical step.

Wait, so the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 is the same in both cases, the ratio R1/R2 is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, because R1 is at T1, R2 at T2.

So R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Which is what I had before.

So, in numbers:

ΔE/(k) = 8.56 eV / 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 99309 K.

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 -1/6000) = 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000) )= 5/(330,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 K^-1.

So 99309 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 ≈ 99309 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute 99309 * 1.515e-5.

Well, 99309 is about 1e5 (since 1e5 is 100,000; 99309 is about 0.993e5).

So 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515. So 99309 * 1.515e-5 is approximately 1.515 * (99309/1e5) ) ≈ 1.515 * 0.993 ≈ 1.505.

So exponent is about 1.505. e^1.505 is approximately e^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^0.005 is about 1.005, so total is about 4.48 *1.005≈4.502.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
F = \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (temperature without spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (temperature with spots).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to a transition wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the factor \( F \)
The term \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) is calculated using \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,309 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Now, calculate the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,309 \times 1.513 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
\]

Finally, compute \( F = \exp(1.502) \). Using \( \exp(1.5) \approx 4.48 \) and \( \exp(0.002) \approx 1.002 \), we find:

\[
F \approx 4.48 \times 1.002 \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**. This corresponds to option **C**.
