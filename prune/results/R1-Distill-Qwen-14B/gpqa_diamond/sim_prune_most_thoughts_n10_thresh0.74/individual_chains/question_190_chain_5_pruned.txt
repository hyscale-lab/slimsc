Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to arrange these five nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive. Let me think through each one.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)
3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate ion (HS⁻)

Wait, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent. Oh right, in aqueous solutions, which is a polar protic solvent, the strength of the nucleophile is affected by how well it can stabilize the charge. But wait, more accurately, in polar protic solvents, larger, softer ions are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. But for hard nucleophiles, the strength is determined by their basicity.

Wait, but in a polar aprotic solvent, the order is more based on basicity since solvation is less. Since the question says aqueous solution, it's definitely polar protic.

So in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity order for common ions is usually: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻, but that's for halides. But in this case, we have different nucleophiles.

Let me think about each:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's a conjugate base of an alcohol. It's an alkoxide ion. Alkoxides are strong bases. But in aqueous solution, they get hydrated. Also, steric factors might play a role. 4-methylcyclohexanol's conjugate base would be a bulky base. So maybe it's less reactive because it's bulky, but since it's an alkoxide, it's a strong nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻): This is a strong base. It's a good nucleophile, but in water, it's actually the conjugate base of water. Wait, but in aqueous solution, hydroxide is less nucleophilic than in, say, DMSO because it's solvated. So its reactivity might be lower than in a polar aprotic solvent.

3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): Propionate is the conjugate base of propionic acid
