Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact probabilities involved.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital periodâ€”three times shorter. That means Planet_1 is closer to its star because the period is shorter. Oh wait, but Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period relates to the semi-major axis. So if the period is shorter, the planet is closer in.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses? Oh, right, because a more massive star doesn't necessarily have to be larger. If a star is evolved, like a subgiant or giant, it can expand. But in this case, both have the same radii, so Planet_1's star is more massive but same size, meaning it's probably hotter or something.

The question is about transit probability. I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, the formula for transit probability is R_planet / R_star, squared, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the star's radius. Because the planet needs to be in the right orbital plane for us to see the transit, which is a factor of the orbital distance.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The probability of a transit is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, that can't be right. Oh no, the actual probability depends on the angle between our line of sight and the orbital plane. If the orbit is edge-on, we see the transit. The probability is roughly (R_planet / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)), but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is the probability being approximately (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a) )? No, maybe it's (R_p / a) * something else. Alternatively, I remember that for a
