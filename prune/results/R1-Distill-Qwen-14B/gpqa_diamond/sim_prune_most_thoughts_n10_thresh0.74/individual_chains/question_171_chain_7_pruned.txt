Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I need to figure out the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six different substances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, but in electrophilic substitution, especially bromination, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, para. Also, some groups are more activating than others, which affects the rate of substitution.

So, each of the given compounds is a benzene ring with a substituent. I need to determine the para-isomer's yield in each case and then arrange them from least to most.

Let me list the compounds again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

First, I need to determine the substituent's effect on the ring. Are they activating or deactivating, and are they ortho/para directors or meta directors?

Let me go through each substituent:

1) CH3: Methyl group is an activating (electron-donating) substituent. It's an ortho/para director. So, in bromination, the product would have bromine mainly at ortho and para positions. But since it's a strong activating group, the ring is more reactive, so the reaction goes faster.

But wait, when only one monobromo is formed, I think that refers to the major product. But for bromination, which positions are favored?

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to compare how much para product each gives.

2) COOEt (ester group): The ester is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. But wait, esters are actually meta directors. Because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group, but the ester oxygen is an activating group? Wait, no. Wait, the ester group is a meta director. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing through induction, which is stronger than the activating effect of the lone pairs. So, the ester is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So, in bromination, the incoming Br would go meta to the ester group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The ester group has a carbonyl, which is electron-withdrawing, making the ring deactivating. The lone pairs on oxygen can donate some electrons, but the overall effect is deactivating. So, the ester is a meta director. So in this case, the major product would be meta, but wait, under certain conditions? Hmm, but for bromination, which is typically a substitution reaction done under specific conditions—like using FeBr3 as a catalyst. Wait
