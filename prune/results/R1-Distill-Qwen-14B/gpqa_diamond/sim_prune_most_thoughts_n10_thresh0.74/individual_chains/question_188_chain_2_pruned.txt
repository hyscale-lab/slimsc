Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, rhombohedral crystal, right? I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal and all angles equal. So, the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and the angles are all the same, which in this case are 30 degrees for alpha, beta, gamma. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal is usually the distance between adjacent atoms along one lattice parameter. So in a cubic system, that would be the edge length. But here it's rhombohedral, so the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal structure. I recall that for a crystal system, you can calculate the interplanar distance using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

The formula for interplanar distance d is (a)/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - hkl (cos α + cos β + cos γ) + ... wait, no. Wait, for a general crystal system, the formula is a bit more complicated. I think it's given by the inverse of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices multiplied by some terms involving the angles.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is:
1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk (cos γ) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos α)) ) / a².

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameter a and angles α, β, γ is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/a².

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the signs. Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the structure factor, but perhaps it's better to look for the correct formula.

Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic crystal, the formula simplifies. But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, so the angles are not 90 degrees. So the formula must account for the angles.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But
