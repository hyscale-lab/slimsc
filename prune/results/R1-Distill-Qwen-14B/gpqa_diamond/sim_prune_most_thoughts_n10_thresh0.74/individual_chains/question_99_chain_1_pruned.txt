Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step.

First, the FTIR part. The question says there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because they have strong O-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong peak. So, the compound has a -COOH group.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So again, this is likely a carboxylic acid because the carbonyl in carboxylic acids appears around 1700 cm^-1. Other groups, like ketones or esters, also have C=O, but the presence of the broad O-H peak supports that it's a carboxylic acid.

Now onto the 1H NMR data. The question says none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, the compound doesn't have any double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any structures with, like, a CH2=CH group or something similar. So, all the hydrogens are either in CH3, CH2, or maybe some branched positions.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think about how coupling works. Each splitting indicates how many neighboring H's are there. For example, a doublet means two neighboring H's, but the complexity could come from multiple coupling partners.

Wait, let's break down the splitting terms. A doublet of triplets would mean that the proton is next to a group that splits it into a doublet, and another group that splits each of those into triplets. Alternatively, it's a two-level splitting. Similarly, a doublet of triplets of triplets must involve even more coupling partners.

I think this kind of splitting is common when a proton is next to multiple
