Okay, so I have this problem about identifying an unknown organic compound using its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm, let me think.

The given NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I remember that in NMR, each peak corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. Let's break down each part.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet (3H). That's probably an acetate group, since acetyl (OAc) groups typically show up around 2 ppm as a singlet because all three protons are equivalent and there's no splitting. So that makes sense for an acetate.

Next, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant J of 16 Hz. A coupling of 16 Hz is pretty large, which usually indicates a trans coupling in a double bond. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another proton. Wait, in an acetate ester, the structure is something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait no, acetate would be like R-O-CO-O-R', no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-O with the R group attached. So the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3 perhaps? Wait, no, acetate is CH3COO- as the ester group. So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, acetate is the ester of acetic acid, so the ester group is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me get this straight: the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3, right? So the acetate is the part attached to the oxygen. So the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When it forms an ester, like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R' is from the acid. So for acetic acid
