Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

Alright, the question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that's a clue. Then, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for -CH3 groups. There are no -CH2 signals. I need to find the molecular formula from the options given, which are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Hmm, let's break this down. So the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring, which probably means it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents. The ester group suggests that one of the substituents is an ester. Ester groups have the structure R-O-CO-R', so they are typically derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols.

Looking at the NMR data, the aromatic protons are split into two signals. A di-substituted benzene ring usually has two sets of aromatic protons if the substituents are para to each other but with more complex splitting if they are meta or ortho. Wait, but if it's di-substituted, the substitution pattern can vary. Let's think about the possibilities.

Wait, the aromatic signals are two, so maybe it's a 1,2-disubstitution (ortho) or 1,4 (para). Because in ortho, the two adjacent substituents would create two sets of aromatic protons. For example, if two substituents are in the ortho positions, the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons, giving two signals. Similarly, para substitution would also lead to two signals because the protons are equivalent across the ring.

So, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, and the substituents are either para or ortho.

Now, the NMR also shows two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. But in this case, since it's a six-membered aromatic ring, the substituents might have double bonds. Oh, wait, they're on the substituents. So the substituents could be groups like ester (O-CO-O) or perhaps an allyl group or something else with vinyl protons.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O. So if one substituent is an ester, maybe the other is a vinyl group. Or perhaps both substituents involve vinyl groups. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are groups that have double bonds. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and the other is an allyl group or a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a substituent with vinyl protons.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So, perhaps the substituents each have a double bond, each contributing one set of vinyl protons. Let me think: maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- something.

Wait, but vinyl groups usually have protons that are either doublets or singlets, depending on the substitution. For example, a trans double bond might have a triplet and a triplet (if each proton is coupled to two others), but I'm not too sure.

Wait, the vinyl Hs in the NMR are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps one vinyl group is a simple CH2=CH– group, where the protons are two doublets (each coupled to the other). But wait, in an isolated double bond, each H is coupled to the other, so each would be a doublet. But in a vinyl group attached to something else, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH– attached to the ring), and the other substituent is an ester, such as O-CO-O-R. Let me imagine a structure where the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group. Alternatively, perhaps both substituents are ester groups or something else.

Wait, but the ester group itself doesn't have vinyl protons. So the vinyl protons must come from another substituent. So maybe one substituent is an ester (e.g., –O–CO–R), and the other is a vinyl group like –CH2–CH2–, but that doesn't have vinyl protons. Wait, no, vinyl groups are CH2=CH– something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are groups like –COOR (ester) and –CH2–CH2–O– (ether?), but that might not have vinyl protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are themselves groups that have double bonds. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group, such as –CH2–CH2–, but that doesn't have double bonds. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR. The aromatic protons are two signals, so it's either para or ortho substitution. The vinyl protons are two sets, so maybe each substituent has a double bond. Wait, but that would require four substituents, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a group with two vinyl protons, and the other substituent is a group with another set.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like –O–CO–R), where R is something like –CH2–CH2–, but that doesn't have vinyl protons. Alternatively, R could be a vinyl group, like –CH2–CH2–COO–, but that still doesn't give vinyl protons on the substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a benzyl ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group, which has a double bond. An allyl group is CH2=CHCH2–, so the vinyl protons would be the ones on the double bond.

So, if one substituent is an ester and the other is an allyl group, then the allyl group would have two vinyl protons. Let me think about that.

An allyl group has two protons on the double bond. Each of these protons would be split by their neighboring H. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2– attached to the ring. The two protons on the double bond would each be adjacent to each other, so each would be a doublet. So in the NMR, that would show as a doublet for each H, but perhaps they are equivalent, giving one doublet. Wait, but in this case, the NMR shows two different vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, that suggests two different types of vinyl protons.

Wait, another possibility: one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group as part of a substituent. For example, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like –CH2–CH2–COOR, but that doesn't have a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is –COOR attached to a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester group. For instance, something like –CH2–COOR would not have vinyl protons. Wait, maybe it's –CH2–CH2–COOR, but that also doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, which is CH2=CH–CH2–. In this case, the two protons on the double bond would be a doublet each. So in the NMR, that would be one doublet.

But the NMR shows two vinyl signals: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. So that suggests two different types of vinyl protons. Hmm.

Let me think of another approach. Let's count the total number of protons from the NMR signals. The aromatic-H signals contribute 2 sets, let's say perhaps 4 protons (if each pair is 2H
