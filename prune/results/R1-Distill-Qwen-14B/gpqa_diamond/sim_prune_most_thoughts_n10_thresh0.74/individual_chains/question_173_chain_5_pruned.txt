Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: An electron is traveling at a speed v of 2x10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, each a different order of magnitude.

Hmm, right. I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I'm not sure if the question is using the precise form or an approximation. I think for minimum uncertainty, we can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2, right?

So, first, I need to find Δp. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. But how does Δp relate to ΔE? Oh wait, maybe I should think about kinetic energy since the electron is moving at a certain speed. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum. So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to Δp squared, perhaps?

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using Heisenberg's principle.
2. Use the uncertainty in momentum to find the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

Wait, but the electron has a definite velocity, not a definite
