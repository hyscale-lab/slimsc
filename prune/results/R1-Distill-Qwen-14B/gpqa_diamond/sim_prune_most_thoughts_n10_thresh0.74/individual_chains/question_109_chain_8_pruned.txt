Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

The question says we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since the final NN state has T(NN)=0, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are A to D, each with different angular momentum states.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So let me break that down. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 means S=0 because 2*0+1=1. L is S, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state is spin zero, orbital angular momentum zero, total angular momentum zero.

When they emit a particle X, the system's properties change. So we have the initial state and the final state after emission. Now, the Pauli condition relates the isospin of the final state to the sum of spin, orbital angular momentum, and 1 mod 2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, meaning S + L is odd.

Wait, but in this case, the final NN state would have their own T, S, and L. Wait, no, wait: the problem says that the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin after emission is 0. So the condition is T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 â‰¡ S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, which is odd.

So for the final state, S + L must be odd. So S and L can't both be even or both odd. One has to be even, the other odd.

Now, the particle X is emitted. Let me consider angular momentum and parity conservation. The initial state has total angular momentum J=0. After emission, the total angular momentum of the system plus X must conserve angular momentum. But wait, the problem is only about the NN system's angular momentum state, I think. Because the options give the angular momentum state of X.

Wait, the problem says, "the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J)" so the state after emission is a partial wave with certain L. So the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, S=0, J=0. Then the emitted particle X has some angular momentum state, say l.

So how does angular momentum conservation come into play? The initial state has total angular momentum J=0. The final state has the NN system with some L and S, and the emitted particle X with angular momentum l. But for the process, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J=0 must equal the
