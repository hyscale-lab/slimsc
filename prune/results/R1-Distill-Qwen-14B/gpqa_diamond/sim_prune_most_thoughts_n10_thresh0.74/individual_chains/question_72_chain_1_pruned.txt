Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So the structure would have the norbornene ring with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so this sounds like an elimination or substitution reaction. Wait, but with two equivalents, maybe it's a di-addition?

Wait, the diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So the structure is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br2 groups at adjacent positions (5 and 6). When treated with NaI, which is a source of iodide, I think it's undergoing a substitution where the Br is replaced by I. But wait, no, maybe a double displacement. Alternatively, since there are two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps each is undergoing a substitution with the tert-butoxy group from the norbornene.

Wait, no, the starting molecule is 7-(tert-butoxy) norbornadiene. So the norbornene has an oxygen substituent. When reacting with the di-substituted cyclohexadiene, perhaps the norbornene acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, but the diene is the cyclohexa-1,3-diene part, which is a conjugated diene. Oh wait, but the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents (CH2Br)2 at 5 and 6 positions. 

Wait, perhaps this is a diels-alder reaction where the norbornadiene is the diene
