Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using spectroscopy data. Let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the data.

Starting with the FTIR. A very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak here is very broad—could that be an -OH group? Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what do those mean? The 1700 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, but I'm not sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. Also, I think the presence of multiple peaks suggests a complex structure, maybe with branching or different environments for the protons.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. What fragments give that? Well, 45 is a common mass for a fragment that includes a ketone group or maybe an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be something like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for something like C3H7O? Hmm, maybe a methyl ketone or something else.

Now, let's think about the options given. They are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

The molecular formulas have varying degrees of unsaturation. Let me calculate that. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 - 0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So either one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But wait, O doesn't affect DoU.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So same as B, two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one ring or one double bond.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond, which adds one DoU. So the formula should have at least one DoU from that. Let me see:

Looking back at the options, all except option D have at least two DoU. Wait, no: option D has one DoU, which could be a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR), then the formula must have enough DoU.

Wait, the NMR indicates vinyl Hs, so a double bond is present. That accounts for one DoU. So any formula with one DoU plus another (like a ring, another double bond, etc.) would fit.

Wait, but what about the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl, so that's another DoU. So that would be two DoU. So the formula must have at least two DoU.

Looking again, options B is C6H10O: DoU is 2, so that fits. C is C6H10O2: DoU is 2 as well. A is C6H12O2: DoU is 1. So if the compound has two DoU (a double bond and a carbonyl), then options B and C fit, but A and D have only one.

So that suggests that A and D can be eliminated because they have only one DoU. So the compound must be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, thinking about the IR. The broad peak is probably an -OH. So the compound has an O-H group. Then, options B is C6H10O: that could be something like a cyclic ether with an alcohol? Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol? Wait, but a ketone would have a carbonyl.

Wait, but the FTIR has 1700 and 1650 peaks. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl. So probably, the compound has a carbonyl group. So if the formula is C6H10O, that's one oxygen. So that carbonyl would be an aldehyde, ketone, or maybe an ester. But if it's an ester, that would need more oxygen. Wait, no, an ester has two oxygen atoms. So if the formula is C6H10O, that can't have an ester group because ester is R-O-CO-O-R, but that would require more O. So if the compound has a carbonyl, and an O-H, how does that
