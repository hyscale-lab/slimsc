Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each symmetry means and whether they're fundamental in the SMEFT framework.

I recall that the SMEFT is an effective theory that builds on the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the symmetries include Lorentz, gauge (like SU(2) and U(1)), and global symmetries. But when it comes to effective theories, I think the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM because otherwise, they wouldn't be valid in that framework.

Lorentz symmetry is about how the theory looks the same under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT operators must too. So operators in SMEFT should be Lorentz invariant. So option 1 is a yes.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, isn't translation symmetry related to momentum conservation? In the context of effective operators, translation symmetry is usually considered. But in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their dimension, and each operator is a local term (like O(μν) or something), so they must transform covariantly under Poincare. But wait, do all operators necessarily respect Poincare symmetry?

Hmm. Or perhaps I'm confusing. The SMEFT is built by adding operators that are Poincare invariant, because the SM is, so yes, all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translation. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Wait, but the options are 1, 2, 3, 4. The options given are 1,2,3,4, and the answer options are combinations.

Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Let's think about each:

1. Lorentz symmetry: Must be respected. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory; any operator must transform appropriately under Lorentz. So 1 is correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Poincare includes Lore
