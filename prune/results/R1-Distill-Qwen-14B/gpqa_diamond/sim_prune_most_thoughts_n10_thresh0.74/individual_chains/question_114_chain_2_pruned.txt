Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, alright.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so let's break down what's happening in each reaction. 

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, which are nucleophiles. So, the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write that structure. 

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give an addition product. Wait, but the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. Oh, I think I remember something about the Stephen reduction or maybe another type of addition. Or perhaps it's a two-step process?

Wait no, maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a source like NaCN in acidic conditions), it forms a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when the cyanide adds to the carbonyl and a proton comes in on the oxygen to form an alcohol. So the general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin (which is an alcohol with a nitrile group attached).

But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN, not HCN. So, to get HCN from NaCN, perhaps we need an acid? Because NaCN would be a weak acid, but if H3O+ is present, maybe it protonates the CN- to HCN, which then attacks the carbonyl.

So reagent A is H3O+ acting as an acid. That would make sense because in the presence of acid, the cyanide
