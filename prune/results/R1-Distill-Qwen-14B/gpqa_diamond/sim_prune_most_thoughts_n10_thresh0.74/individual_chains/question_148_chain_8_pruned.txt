Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again and break down each part.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Hmm, binary compounds are compounds with two elements, so each of these would be YF_x, where x varies.

The first part talks about substance A1. It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidizing usually means it's acting as an oxidizing agent, so it's a strong oxidizer. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe it's being oxidized to a higher oxidation state. What compounds are strong oxidizers and red? I'm thinking of something like fluorine-containing compounds.

Wait, a bright red substance—maybe it's a fluorine compound. For example, I remember that AgF is colorless, but maybe something else. Oh! Fluorine gas itself is a bright yellow, but maybe it's another compound. Oh wait, maybe it's a fluorine compound like ClF3, but that's not with Y. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound that when decomposed releases F2 gas? Because in the decomposition, fluorine is produced.

So, A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So, let me write a possible decomposition reaction. Let's say A1 is YF_x, which upon heating gives A2 and F2. So, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower one. For example, maybe YF3 decomposes into YF2 and F2? Or another possibility: YF6 decomposes into YF3 and F2? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the decomposition of YF5 (if Y is something like P, which forms PF5, which decomposes on heating).

Wait, PF5 is a colorless liquid, but maybe another element. Alternatively, what about sulfur? S forms SF6, which is a bright yellow liquid. Oh wait, that sounds right! SF6 is bright yellow, and when heated, it decomposes. Let me think: SF6 on heating decomposes into S2F10? Or maybe
