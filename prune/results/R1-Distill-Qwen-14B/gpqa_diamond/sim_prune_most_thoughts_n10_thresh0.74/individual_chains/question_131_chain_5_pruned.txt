Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. Dicarboxylic acids have two carboxylic acid groups, and cis-alkene means the double bond has the same groups on each side. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Anhydrides are typically formed by the loss of water from two carboxylic acid groups.

The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, that's a high ppm, usually around where aromatic protons or possibly alkenes resonate, but 7 is more aromatic. But wait, another thought: anhydrides can have carbonyl groups, but that's carbon. For protons, maybe it's an aromatic ring? Or perhaps an alpha-proton, but that's usually lower. Hmm, maybe it's not an aromatic. Wait, another possibility: the anhydride structure. If it's a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring, maybe the protons are near the carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the peak at 7 ppm is from an enol or something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the 13C NMR, there are two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon with a double bond (like a spÂ² carbon), maybe from the alkene. The 165 ppm is very likely a carbonyl carbon. Anhydrides have two carbonyl groups, so that fits. So, the structure of the anhydride must have one double bond (since the starting material was a cis-alkene) and two carbonyl groups.

So the starting anhydride probably is a cyclic structure. Maybe a five-membered ring with one double bond and two carbonyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis double bond. So when dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

But wait, maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond. The 1H NMR of maleic anhydride shows a couple of doublets around 7.7-8.0 ppm, but in this problem, the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests maybe a different structure. Or perhaps there's symmetry. Oh wait, maybe the anhydride is symmetrical, leading to equivalent protons. Maybe something like a succinic anhydride? No, that's a six-membered ring with no double bonds. Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene, so the anhydride must have a double bond. Let's think. If the anhydride is a five-membered ring, then it's similar to maleic anhydride. But in maleic
