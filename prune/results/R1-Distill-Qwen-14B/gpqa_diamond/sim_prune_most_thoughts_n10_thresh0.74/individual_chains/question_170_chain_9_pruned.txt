Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented as two-component vectors because an electron is a spin-1/2 particle. So the state vector here is (3i, 4), which can be written as a column vector like [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. For spin along the y-direction, the operator is σ_y (sigma y). Oh right, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which is given here as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times σ_y, right? Because spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = ħ/2 * σ_y.

The expectation value <S_y> is the bra-ket product of the state with S_y acting on the state. So in mathematical terms, it's ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ is the spinor.

Breaking this down, ψ is [3i; 4]. The bra vector ψ† would be the conjugate transpose, so [ -3 (since 3i's conjugate is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i? Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The conjugate of 3i is -3i. So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait wait, no. Because ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† would be [ (3i)* , 4* ] as a row vector. So 3i conjugated is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4 conjugated is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

But since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can factor that out. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * ψ† σ_y ψ.

So I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute σ_y times ψ first.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by ψ, which is [3i; 4], I get:

First element: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i

Second element: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i^2 + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so ψ† (σ_y ψ) = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2. i squared is -1. So 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So adding these together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, no, no, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the components are ( -3i, 4 ), and the vector σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Compute each part:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 → 12 (-1) → -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that gives me ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Hmm, but wait, that feels a bit off. Let me recheck the multiplication.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating σ_y ψ.

Let me do σ_y * ψ again.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So for ψ = [3i, 4]^T, the first component of σ_y ψ is 0*(3i) + (-i) *4 = 0 -4i = -4i.

Second component is i*(3i) + 0*4. i *3i is 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

So yes, σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

(-3i)*(-4i) = (12) i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Then, the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24).

Which is (-24 ħ ) / 2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/ 25, and option B is 12 hbar/25.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because my calculation gives -12 ħ, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. Did I miscalculate the ψ vector or the multiplication?

Wait, perhaps the initial state was given as (3i,4). But when I write it as a column vector, it's [3i;4], right? So when I calculate σ_y ψ, I get [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order when taking the dot product. Let me try again.

Wait, the dot product is (ψ†) times (σ_y ψ). So ψ† is a row vector [ -3i, 4 ] and σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].
