Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. So the interaction between the bosonic field X and the fermions is given by this Lagrangian.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I'm supposed to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option lists different fermion-antifermion pairs that X can decay into.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, the rest mass of the parent particle must be equal to or greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So, if X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay product must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, assuming X decays into a pair of the same fermion (like fermion and anti-fermion).

But wait, let me think: the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay products must be less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV is the total, and each fermion is half.

What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them. In the Standard Model, the known fermions are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But wait, neutrinos are massless for the most part, or have very tiny masses. So for decay into neutrinos, since their mass is negligible, perhaps X can decay into any neutrino-antineutrino pair, but that's probably beyond the current options.

But the problem is about the interaction given. The Lagrangian term is L = -λ f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps I should interpret this as the interaction term. So the Feynman rule would be a vertex with X boson coupling to two fermions ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass allows it.

So the possible decay products are any fermion and its antiparticle. But X has a mass of 6 GeV, so the pair must each have mass less than 3 GeV.

Let's look at the masses of the fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV (way less than 3 GeV)
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV (still way less)
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV (about 1.78, so 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV. Wait, wait, 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV together. Oh wait, but X is 6 GeV. So 3.56 is less than 6. So tau can be produced as a pair. Because the sum is 3.56 <6. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Quarks:
But wait, quarks are confined, so they can't be observed as free particles. So in practice, decays into quarks would require hadronization. But perhaps the question is considering possible decay channels regardless of detection, so maybe all possible fermion pairs are considered, including quarks.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not about whether they are observed or not. So let's focus on the mass constraints.

So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Let's list the fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so negligible)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (negligible)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (also negligible)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: all are very light, perhaps treated as massless.

So, for each possible fermion pair:

For quarks:
