Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals (singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. We have four options to choose from, each pair of compounds.

First, I need to understand the structures of the given options. Let's list them out:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: So the benzene ring has methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. That leaves positions 3 and 6. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a circle. So if methyls are at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to methyls? Hmm.

2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: Methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 are open.

3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: Methyls at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are open.

4. 1,4-diethylbenzene: This would have ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4, right? So the structure is benzene with two ethyls opposite each other (like para substitution).

Wait, but the molecular formula here: each compound is C10H14. Let's check each:

For tetramethylbenzenes, each methyl is -CH3. So benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups would be C6 + 4*(C1) = C10, and H: 6 - (4*2) + 4*3 = 6 -8 +12 = 10. So formula is C10H10? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Benzene has six carbons and six hydrogens. Each substitution for a methyl (CH3) replaces one H. So for four methyl groups, benzene becomes C6 +4C = C10, and the H count: 6 -4 (since each methyl replaces one H) + 4*3 (each CH3 adds 3 H) = 6-4=2 +12=14. So molecular formula is C10H14. Oh, okay, so the tetramethylbenzenes fit.

But for 1,4-diethylbenzene: Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl adds two C and two H (since each is -CH2CH3: two carbons, so 2*2=4 C in ethyls. So benzene plus two ethyls is C6 + 2*(C2) = C10. Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl has 2 CH2 and one CH3. Wait, no: each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl contributes 2*(CH2) + 3 (from CH3)? No, wait, the ethyl group is two carbons, each CH2. So each ethyl is CH2CH3. So substituting two H's on benzene, each ethyl brings 2+3 =5 H? Wait, no, that's not right. The substituent is -CH2CH3; each has 2+3=5 H, but each substitution replaces one H on benzene. So for each ethyl group: benzene loses one H, and the ethyl adds 2 (from CH2) + 3 (from CH3) =5 H. So for two ethyls, total H is 6 (benzene) -2 (replaced) + 2*(5) =6-2+10=14. So formula is C8H10? Wait, benzene is C6, two ethyls (each C2) would be C6 +2*2= C10. So C10H14. Oh, right. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is also C10H14. So all four options are possible.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic region shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm. Each is a singlet, so no neighboring Hs. The 1:1 ratio suggests that each singlet comes from each compound. Because the mixture is 1:1, each of the two signals is from each compound, each having perhaps the same number of protons. Wait, but the integration is 1:1 for the two signals, so each has an equal number of H.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are singlets, meaning all the Hs in those signals are equivalent and not split by neighboring Hs. So each compound must have equivalent aromatic protons.

The other part is the signals at 2.2 ppm. Three singlets, ratio 2:1:1. So the three signals are from different types of methyl groups, perhaps. Looking at the options, let's see which have different methyl environments.

Let's analyze each compound:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tet
