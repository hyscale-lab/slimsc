Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a single qubit system. Because when you have equal probabilities for both states |0⟩ and |1⟩, it's not a pure state but a completely mixed one.

But wait, how does this translate into the geometrical position? I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector for a state describes its position in the 3D space. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, and the Bloch vector is determined by the coefficients of ψ.

So for the given ρ, it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal coefficients. Let's expand ρ:

ρ = (1/2)|0⟩⟨0| + (1/2)|1⟩⟨1|
Which can also be written as:
ρ = diag(1/2, 1/2)

In terms of the Bloch sphere, the density matrix can be represented as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2
Where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z).

So let's set up the equation. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|), which in matrix form is:
[[1/2, 0],
 [0, 1/2]]

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and when we write (I + r·σ)/2, the matrices for σ are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Then (I + r·σ)/2 would be:

( [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
     [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ] ) / 2

But our ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2. That means the off-diagonal terms in the expression above must be zero, and the diagonal terms must be 1/2.

So, the off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0. So both r_x and r_y must be zero because the imaginary part must be zero as well. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0.

Now looking at the diagonal terms. Each diagonal element is (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Our ρ has both as 1/2. So setting up the equation:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought the completely mixed state is at the origin. Oh wait, yes! Because the Bloch vector for a completely mixed state is (0,0,0). That makes sense because it's the center of the Bloch sphere, representing maximum mixedness.

So the position is r=(0,0,0), which is option C.

I think that's right. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

which represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface, while mixed states lie inside. For a density matrix, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is determined by the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the off-diagonal terms of \( \rho \) must vanish, implying \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms of \( \rho \) are equal to \( 1/2 \), which requires \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the completely mixed state at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).
