Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an aromatic compound based on its spectral data. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So the ring is benzene, I suppose, with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group present. Esters have carbonyl groups (C=O), so that's a key point.

Looking at the NMR data: There are six signals in the 1H NMR. Let's parse each part. 

First, two signals for aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the number of distinct aromatic protons. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent H: the two H on each substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if it's para, in the ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets. Like, if it's para-disubstituted, the ring would have two types of H: those ortho to substituents and those meta? Or maybe more accurately, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite, so the ring's H are in two sets of two each. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. If the substituents are in para positions, then each substituent is opposite. So the H adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent. So in a para-substituted benzene, you get two sets of aromatic H: for example, two H each in the para position relative to substituents. So that would give two signals. That fits with the two aromatic H signals mentioned. So the substitution is probably para.

Next, two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H are typically those adjacent to double bonds, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. But in a benzene ring, the H are all part of the aromatic system. Wait, unless there's an additional double bond, like in a substituent. Oh right, the ester group is probably part of a substituent on the benzene.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but more accurately, in an ester, it's R-O-CO-R. So the substituent on the benzene might be an ester group. For example, something like OMeCO2 or similar.

Wait, the substituent could be an ester group, say, for example, -OOCR. So if the substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-OR'), then where would that leave the H's in the molecule?

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl H. Hmm. Vinyl H suggests a double bond adjacent to CH groups. So perhaps the substituent is an acyl group with a double bond. Like a vinyl ester? Such as –CO-O–CH2–CH2–? No, wait, maybe the substituent is an ester attached to a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be something like
