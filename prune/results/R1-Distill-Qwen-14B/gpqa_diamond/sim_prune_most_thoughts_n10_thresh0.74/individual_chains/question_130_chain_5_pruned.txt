Okay, so I've got this question here about neutral hydrogen clouds absorbing light from quasars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. I remember that redshift tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is mentioned. Lyman alpha is a specific emission line of hydrogen, right? The rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But if a cloud of neutral hydrogen is between us and a quasar, it would absorb that wavelength. So when we observe it, the absorption line would be shifted to longer wavelengths due to redshift.

But the thing is, ground-based optical telescopes can't see into the ultraviolet, right? Because our atmosphere absorbs UV light. So any light that's shifted into the optical range would be detectable. So the Lyman alpha absorption line needs to be redshifted into the optical part of the spectrum.

So the key here is to find the minimum redshift z where the observed wavelength λ_obs is in the optical range. Let's think about what the optical range is. I think optical wavelengths are roughly from about 400 nm to 700 nm. Wait, but wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So if the redshift z is such that 121.6*(1+z) is around 400 nm or just above, that's the point where it enters the optical.

Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = 1216*(1+z) must be >=4000 Angstroms. Let's solve for z.

So, 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

Divide both sides by 1216: (1+z) >= 4000/1216 ≈ 3.293.

So 1 + z >= ~3.293, so z >= 2.293.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the closest higher option is C) 2.4 and D)1.9.

Wait, 2.293 is approximately 2.3. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. So the minimum redshift is about 2.3, which would correspond to option C (2.4) because 2.4 is the lower limit? Or wait, perhaps I should think about what the question is asking.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So it's the minimum z where the absorption line is at the lower end of the optical range. So if the observed wavelength is exactly 400 nm, what's z?

So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So 4000 = 1216*(1+z) → (1+z) = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.292. So z≈2.292.

But ground-based
