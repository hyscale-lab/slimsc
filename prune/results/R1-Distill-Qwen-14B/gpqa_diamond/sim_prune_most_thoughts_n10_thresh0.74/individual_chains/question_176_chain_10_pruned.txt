Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait. Oh, wait, I think I need to normalize that state vector because the probabilities have to add up to 1. Let me check that. The vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The square of the magnitudes: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, there are two operators, P and Q. The matrices for these operators are provided. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)

Operator Q's matrix is:
First row: (1, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -1)

The question is, if we measure P first and then Q, what's the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, wait, no, the question says: "probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So I think it's the probability that when you measure P first, you get 0, and then measuring Q gives -1.

Alternatively, maybe the order is that you measure P, then Q. So the measurement of P affects the state, as the system collapses into an eigenstate of P.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P. Then, when you measure Q on that state, you'll get an eigenvalue of Q.

But wait, perhaps the order is to measure P first, then Q. So the state after P's measurement is the eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because the question is about getting 0 for P. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, see which eigenvectors correspond to eigenvalue 0, then compute the probability of the system collapsing into that eigenvector when you measure P.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me think about operator P first.

So, operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

I can write this matrix as P.

To find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

But perhaps there's a smarter way
