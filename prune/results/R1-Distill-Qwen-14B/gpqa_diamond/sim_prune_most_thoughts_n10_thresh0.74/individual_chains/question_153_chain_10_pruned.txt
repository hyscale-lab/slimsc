Okay, so I'm faced with this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out what each reaction produces. Let me start by recalling what the Michael addition is all about.

The Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is a conjugate addition, right? The nucleophile adds to the beta position, forming an enolate intermediate which then captures a proton or another group.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonates the alpha position of the carbonyl, creating an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a strong nucleophile as a diester. The other component, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's the Michael acceptor.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let me think about the structure. The acrylate has the structure CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait no, the acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, the substituents on the double bond are. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the double bond. Oh, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is CH2-CH(p-tolyl), then a carbonyl.

So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (the CH2 in CH2=C(p-tolyl)), the attack would happen at the beta carbon, so the CH2 becomes attached to the malonate's enolate. Let me visualize: the enolate is -O-CH2-CO-OCH2-CH3 (dimethyl malonate, with the enolate at the central CH). Wait, no. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2CO2CH2CO2CH3, right? So when deprotonated, the enolate is at the central CH, so the structure is CH2CO2CH3, with a negative charge on the central carbon.

So the enolate would attack the beta carbon, which is the CH2 in CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the attack would add the malonate's enolate to that CH2, making a new bond. So the product would be a new carbonyl group connected to the malonate.

Wait, perhaps
