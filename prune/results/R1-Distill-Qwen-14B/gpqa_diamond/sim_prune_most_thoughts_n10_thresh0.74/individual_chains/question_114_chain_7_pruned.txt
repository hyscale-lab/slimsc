Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to form a butanoic acid. The options give possible A and B combinations. I need to figure out which reagents fit each step.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed via the substitution of the carbonyl oxygen. So, the mechanism probably involves the formation of an enolate. Wait, or is it a nucleophilic addition? Oh right, in the presence of a strong base, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- which is a nucleophile. But butanone is a ketone. So, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition followed by something else.

Wait, wait. I think when you have a ketone reacting with a nitrile under certain conditions, it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation involves adding a cyanide nucleophile to the carbonyl. But wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. The conditions for this reaction usually involve an acid catalyst, right?

So, for the cyanohydrin formation (like in the Gattermann–Koch reaction or similar?), I think the reagent would be an acid. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which facilitates the attack by the nucleophile (CN- in this case). So in the first step, the reagent A is probably H3O+ as the acid.

Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yes, it's a cyanohydrin where the ketone has added a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So that formation requires acid catalysis, so A must be an acid like H3O+.

So for the first part, reagent A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- and H+.

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used here? Maybe if it's a different kind of reaction. But for cyanohydrin formation, the acid is usually H3O+ or something like H2SO4. So A is H3O+.

Moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group in the same carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? The usual methods involve hydrolysis. One common way is under strong acidic conditions, like with HCl, or under basic conditions with H2O and heat.

Wait, but wait. There's also the Stephen reduction and other methods, but in this case, the starting material has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile. So the structure is something like R-C(OH)-CN. When you hydrolyze a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group, I think it's called the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a ketone, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is R-C(OH)-CN. So, perhaps the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, but the actual structure would have the nitrile on C2, along with the hydroxyl. So it's like:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-R, but perhaps more accurately, it's a four-carbon chain where the second carbon has both a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-R.

Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on the fourth carbon? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So in any case, the second reaction's starting material has a nitrile and a hydroxyl on the same carbon.

So when this reacts with water (H2O) and reagent B, it forms a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Wait, the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)(COOH)-R. So the nitrile group (CN) has been converted into a COOH group.

So the process is nitrile → carboxylic acid. The usual hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires specific conditions. I think acidic hydrolysis, like using HCl (H+/Cl-) as a catalyst, or perhaps using a strong acid.

Wait, but in the presence of water and an acid, the nitrile can hydrolyze. For example, under strong acidic conditions
