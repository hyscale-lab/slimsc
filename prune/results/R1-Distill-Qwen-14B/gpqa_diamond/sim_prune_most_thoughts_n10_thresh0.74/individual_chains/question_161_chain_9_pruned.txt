Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about a transmission electron microscope and mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's see. So, Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. But despite that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. 

He accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state, which is λ1. Mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions, I think. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Or wait, maybe it's λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2)). Oh right, yes, because the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions.

So initially, the mean free path is λ1. But when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that doesn't change. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Oh, I remember that electrons can cause various effects. One thing that comes to mind is gas electron microscopy, where the electron beam interacts with gas molecules, causing them to ionize or become excited. Or maybe the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules.

But wait, in a vacuum, the main issue is scattering of electrons by gas molecules. If there's a higher density of gas, the scattering is more. But here, the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum, so the mean free path is longer than normal. Wait, but when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are getting heated or the pressure is affected somehow.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it can cause the gas molecules to ionize. If the gas is ionized, the ions have a different charge state, which could affect their interaction with the electron beam.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited or even pumped out of the system, thereby reducing the pressure. But that might not be the case here because the pressure was already very low, so perhaps the effect is minimal.

Wait, but thinking in terms of the mean free path, which is inversely proportional to the number density of the gas molecules. So if the number of gas molecules in the sample compartment decreases when the electron beam is on, n would decrease. Since λ is proportional to 1/n, a lower n would mean a longer λ, so λ2 would be larger than λ1. But wait, the question says that after starting the electron beam, the mean free path is λ2, which is different from λ1. So if λ2 is longer or shorter?

Alternatively, could the presence of the electron beam cause the gas molecules to move or change their distribution, thereby affecting their number density in the area where the electron beam is passing through, like the column?

Wait, but the initial measurement of λ1 was done with the pumps creating the ultra-high vacuum. Then, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the beam itself is causing
