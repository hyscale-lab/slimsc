Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Hmm, let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure, but I'm not super clear on the exact structure. Oh right, adamantane has a structure similar to a diamond, with multiple fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking maybe an elimination reaction here. Dehydrohalogenation perhaps? Since it's dibromide and KOH, maybe it's a double elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's in a structure like that, maybe the elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Or maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, meaning adjacent carbons have two bromines. Wait, no: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are separated by one carbon in the adamantane structure. So maybe the structure is such that when KOH is added, it eliminates two HBr molecules, forming a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Or perhaps it forms a single diene? Hmm, not entirely certain, but perhaps the product is a diene.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Also, the 1H NMR spectrum is given: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, that's interesting because KOH usually isn't a carbonyl-forming agent. Unless it's an elimination to form a ketone via some kind of oxidation. Wait, but wait, elimination
