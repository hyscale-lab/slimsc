Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The user has prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The options are four different structures, and I need to pick the right one based on the spectral data.

First, let's look at the IR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical 3000-3300 cm⁻¹ for O-H. But carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak, maybe around 2500-3300, but sometimes it can be broad and might overlap with other things. Also, the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong absorption, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit lower. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR doesn't show any vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds or aromatic rings probably. So the compound is likely a saturated molecule.

The NMR shows several signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each coupling in the splitting adds another level. So for example, a doublet of triplets would mean each peak is split by two different couplings. Wait, no, actually, when you have multiple couplings, each splitting multiplies the number of peaks. So a doublet (from one coupling) splits into a triplet (another coupling), and then each of those splits again into a quartet (third coupling). So it's a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three different coupling partners.

Wait, but how does that happen? Let's think about the structure. Maybe the hydrogen is attached to a carbon that's next to multiple different sets of hydrogens. For example, a CH group adjacent to three different groups.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has branching, leading to such complex splitting. Let me look at the options.

The options all have a COOH group, so I can ignore any structures without that. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So the structure is... Let's draw it. The main chain is CH2COOH. Before that, there's a CH connected to two C2H5 groups. So the structure is something like: CH2CH2(C2H5)2-CH2-COOH? Wait no, perhaps the central part is two CH groups each attached to two ethyl groups. Wait, maybe it's a gem-dimethyl but with ethyl groups? Let me parse the formula more carefully.

The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the molecule is:

CH2COOH is at one end. Then there's a CH group attached to an ethyl group on each side. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2(C2H5)2-COOH? Wait, no, the chain would be longer.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, no, the formula given is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the carbons. Let me think: the central part is two adjacent
