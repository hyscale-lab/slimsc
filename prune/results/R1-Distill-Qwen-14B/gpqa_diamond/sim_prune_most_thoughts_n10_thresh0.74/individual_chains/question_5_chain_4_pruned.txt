Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. So, P acting on the eigenvector equals the eigenvalue times the eigenvector.

Wait, but the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, the direction vector n can be expressed as a combination of the x, y, and z unit vectors. But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component must be zero. So, n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to θ being the angle from the z-axis. So θ is the polar angle, and phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane.

The operator P is a vector operator, so it can be expressed as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But each component of P is given in terms of a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me look at the given P components again. The problem states:

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,1], second row [1,0]. That's the Pauli X matrix.

P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0,-i], second row [i,0]. That's the Pauli Y matrix.

P_z is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [1,0], second row [0,-1]. That's the Pauli Z matrix.

So, the operator vector P is along direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the direction n can be written as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), as I thought. Therefore, the operator along n would be P·n, which is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, because the operator in the direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosines. Oh right, because any vector can be expressed as the sum of its components times the unit vectors. So for a vector operator, the operator in direction n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But here, since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

So substituting n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, then P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

So, the operator in the direction of n is:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ ]

Because each P component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

So, the matrix form of P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

Wait, let me calculate that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

σ_x sinθ = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
σ_z cosθ = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together gives:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, no. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|v> = λ |v>, and our λ is +ħ/2.

So, substituting the matrix form, we have:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Wait, because the eigenvalue is ħ/2, so multiplying it by [a; b] gives the result. We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b → sinθ a + (- cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, that's two equations:

1) (cosθ -1)a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Hmm, these are two equations. Let me write them again.

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Equation 2: sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b. Since the equations are homogeneous, there will be non-trivial solutions only if the determinant is zero.

But maybe it's easier to find a ratio a/b from equation 1.

From equation 1:

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a/b = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1 )

Simplify denominator: cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ ) = -2 sin²(theta/2) , and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ).

So,

a/b = [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ]

Simplify: [ -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ] 

The negatives cancel, 2 cancels, sin(theta/2) cancels one in numerator and denominator.

So,

a/b = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So, a = b cot(theta/2 )

Alternatively, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b → a = [ cot(theta/2) ] b

So, let's set b as a parameter, say b = 1, then a = cot(theta/2 )

Wait, but let's put this into equation 2 to check.

Equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Substitute a = cot(theta/2) b.

=> sinθ * cot(theta/2) b + (-cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ sinθ cot(theta/2) - (cosθ +1 ) ] = 0

We can compute sinθ cot(theta/2):

sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 )

So,

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] = 2 cos²(theta/2 )

So, 2 cos²(theta/2 ) - ( cosθ +1 ) = 0 ?

Wait, let's compute cosθ +1.

cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2 )

Wait, no: cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2 ) -1.

So, cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2 )

So,

2 cos²(theta/2 ) - [2 cos²(theta/2 ) ] = 0 → 0=0.

So, equation 2 is satisfied. Therefore, the ratio a/b is indeed cot(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

|v> = [ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2); 1 ] * b, where b is a scalar multiple.

But let's express this in terms of sine and cosine. Let's see.

Let me express it in terms of theta/2.

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

So,

a = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

b = 1

So, the vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] multiplied by 1/sin(theta/2 )

Wait, wait. Let me think. Let's write the eigenvector as:

v = [ a, b ]^T = [ ( cos(theta/2) ) / sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]^T.

Which can be written as:

v = (1/sin(theta/2 )) [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

But we need to normalize this vector. So, the normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1.

Compute |a|² + |b|²:

= [ (cos(theta/2) )^2 / (sin(theta/2 ))^2 ] + [1]^2

= [ cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) ] / sin²(theta/2 )

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, a = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 ), so |a|² = [ cos^2(theta/2) ] / [ sin^2(theta/2) ]

b = 1, so |b|² = 1.

So,

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ cos²(theta/2) / sin²(theta/2) ] + 1

= [ cos²(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / sin^2(theta/2 )

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1 = sin^2(theta/2)/sin^2(theta/2 ). Hmm, wait, no:

Wait, 1 = [ sin^2(theta/2) ] / [ sin^2(theta/2) ]

So,

[ cos²(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) ] / sin^2(theta/2 ) = [1] / sin^2(theta/2 )

So,

The sum is 1 / sin^2(theta/2 )

Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt( sin^2(theta/2 ) ), which is |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is
