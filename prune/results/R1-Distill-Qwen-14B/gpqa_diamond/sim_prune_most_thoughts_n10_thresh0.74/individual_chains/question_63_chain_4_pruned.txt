Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled with the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm. So, the molecule consists of two atoms, X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are given for the photon's momentum p.

Wait, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels account for both rotational and vibrational energies. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level and the ground rotational state, maybe? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. The fundamental state is usually the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1?), depending on whether it's a rigid or non-rigid rotor.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. But the non-rigid rotor model considers the bond length changing, so it's more like a vibration plus rotation. Oh, right, the non-rigid rotor is part of the rotation-vibration coupling, where the vibrational energy affects the rotational energy.

But the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or J=1). Wait, for a diatomic, the rotational states start at J=0, but for some reason, I thought J=1 is the lowest for certain molecules, but maybe it's J=0. Wait, actually, for a linear rotor, J can be 0,1,2...

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So if it's the ground state, it's n=0 (vibrational ground) and J=0 (rotational ground). Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest state. So what's the next state?

Hmm, the next state would be either an increase in vibrational energy (n=1) or an increase in rotational energy (J=1). Because the energy levels are quantized, and the transition depends on the photon's energy. The question is about the lowest possible energy increase, so perhaps the smallest photon energy needed would be the vibrational transition. Because I think vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely than rotational. Or wait, no, maybe the other way around?

Wait, no. The spacing between rotational levels is given by the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels have much larger spacing. Because the vibrational energy is quantized in much larger steps. So for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than the rotational ones.

Wait, the energy for rotation is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So for the fundamental state, n=0
