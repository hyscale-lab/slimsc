Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star moves back and forth, and we can measure that shift in the spectral lines.

Wait, the question says both stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, same host star mass, same planet mass. Interesting.

The key data here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of the orbital periods of planet #2 to planet #1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the planet's orbital period? I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the orbital period, and other factors. 

The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * sqrt(1-e²)) ) ) )^(1/3) ). But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, there's another formula that connects the velocity semi-amplitude (K) with the orbital period (P), the star's mass, and the planet's mass.

Wait, I think the formula is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since the eccentricity isn't mentioned, and the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the term (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. So we can ignore that for simplicity.

Also, since the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), which is solar mass. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both
