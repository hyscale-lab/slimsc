Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

Wait, I remember that mesons are particles, and their decay distance depends on their lifetime. Oh right, because the decay distance is how far they travel before disintegrating. So the formula probably involves the lifetime of the particle.

The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), and the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time (Δt). So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I think the exact relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the decay width, so the mean lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find how fast the meson is moving. Because the decay distance is speed multiplied by lifetime. So v * τ.

But how do I find the velocity? I probably need to use the energy and mass to find the momentum, then the velocity.

The production energy E_X is 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is produced with some kinetic energy. The total energy E is related to the rest mass m and the kinetic energy.

Wait, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy (m c²) and kinetic energy. But since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, E is much larger than m. So this is a high-energy particle, so relativistic effects are significant.

In relativistic terms, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p, the momentum.

So let's calculate p. Let me write that out.

E = 8 GeV
m = 1.2 GeV

So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2

So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2
p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c^2? Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². Let's think in units carefully.

Wait, E in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=1), the equation simplifies. But perhaps it's easier to use SI units.

But maybe it's easier to compute the velocity beta (β = v/c) first. Because E = γ m c², and p = γ m v, so maybe there's a way to find β.

Alternatively, for high energies, E ≈ pc, since when E >> m c², p ≈ E/c.

But since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, E is 8/1.2 ≈ 6.666 times larger than m, so it's relativistic but not extremely high. Hmm, but I think the approximation E ≈ pc might not be too bad. Let me check.

Alternatively, I can compute beta. Let's see.

The relation between E, m, and p is:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2

Then p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c² ?

Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, units can be a bit tricky. Let me get the units right.

E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². So E = gamma m c².

So, E = γ m c² → gamma = E/(m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV and GeV/c², we can compute gamma as E/(m c^2) ? Wait, no, because E's unit is GeV, m is GeV/c², so E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / ( (GeV/c²) * c² ) → GeV / GeV = unitless. So gamma = E/(m c²) → but wait, E is the total energy, so gamma is E/(m c²).

So gamma is 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ). The c² in the denominator comes from m c².

Wait, 8 GeV divided by (1.2 GeV) → 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

But I think that's not necessary. Let's compute beta first.

We have E = gamma m c^2, and p = gamma m v, and beta = v/c.

So, p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c.

So from E = gamma m c², gamma is E/(m c²), so gamma = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV * c^2) ? Wait, that's not right. Wait, E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2) → but E and m are both in energy units when multiplied by c^2. Wait, perhaps I should just compute gamma as E / (m c²) with proper
