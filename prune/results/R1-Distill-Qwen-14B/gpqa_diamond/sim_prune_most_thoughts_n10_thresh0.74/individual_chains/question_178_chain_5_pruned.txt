Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Lagrangian problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me think step by step.

First, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, because I remember that the commutator of gamma matrices gives rise to the antisymmetric tensor σ.

So, I think I need to figure out the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 in four-dimensional spacetime because the action is dimensionless and each term in the Lagrangian density is integrated over four dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Breaking down L_int: it's the product of κ, ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let me find the dimensions of each component.

I know that the fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, Dirac spinors have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be 3/2, since it's the adjoint.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, right? The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ, γ], which is zero. Wait, but wait: actually, each term in σ is a gamma matrix commutator, but that's just matrices, so σ itself is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] is 0.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The field strength tensor F has the same dimension as the gauge field A, if I recall correctly. Because F_{μν} is the derivative of A plus a term with A squared. Derivatives have dimension 1, and A has dimension 1 (since it's a gauge potential, which is dimension 1 in four dimensions). So F_{μν} has dimension 2. Because the derivative (dimension 1) times A (dimension 1) gives dimension 2.

Wait, let me double-check: gauge fields A have mass dimension 1. Since the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, where ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1 to have the same dimensions as ∂. Then F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ + [A,A], so the first term is dimension 2, and the [A,A] term is also dimension 2. So F is dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (3/2), σ_{μν} (0), ψ (3/2), and F^{μν} (2). So the product is (3/2 + 0 +3/2 + 2) = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the total dimension is 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, no. Wait, wait, each field in the term: ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So summing them: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 gives 5. Then, the whole term must have dimension 4 because it's in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian is [Mass]^4, right?

So wait, the product κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4. So the total dimension is 4. So the dimension of κ is 4 minus the sum of the other fields.

Wait, the other fields sum
