Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy of formation questions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Wait, let me try to visualize the structure. Oh right, it's something with two double bonds maybe? Or maybe just one? Let me count the double bonds. The formula has two parts with C=C in them. So maybe it's a diene or something more complex.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make individual atoms. So that's the energy needed to break all the bonds in a carbon atom, which probably relates to the bond energies given.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

I think the approach here is to use the enthalpy of atomization formula. The enthalpy of formation of a compound can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula I remember is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = (sum of bond energies in products) - (sum of bond energies in reactants)

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, when bonds are broken, you put energy in, so if you're forming bonds, you release energy. So the formula should be:

The enthalpy change (ΔH) is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think. When bonds are formed, it releases energy, so the products have lower energy than reactants if bonds form. So if I'm calculating the enthalpy of formation, which is the energy change when forming the molecule from its elements, I need to consider the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should consider it as the reverse. Let me think of the molecule as being formed from its constituent atoms. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break all bonds in the molecule to form individual atoms. So the reverse process, forming the molecule from atoms, would be negative of that.

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization as 1000 kJ/mol. So the energy needed to break all bonds in the molecule is 1000 kJ per mol of C. Wait, no. Wait, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So that's the energy to break all bonds in a carbon atom into individual atoms. But each carbon atom has bonds to other atoms in the molecule, right? So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total bond energies in the molecule and then use the enthalpy of atomization to find the enthalpy of formation. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the formula I think is:

Enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) = [ (sum of bond energies in the molecule) ] × [some factor] ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Here, the elements are carbon and hydrogen.

So, for the molecule, the formation would involve the breaking of bonds in the reactants (elements) and the forming of bonds in the product (the compound). So the process would be:

Elements (C and H) → Atoms → Molecule.

Wait, but wait, the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite, and for hydrogen is H2 gas. So when forming the molecule, we're starting from those.

So the steps would be:

1. Break the bonds in the elements (C and H2) to get atoms.
2. Form
