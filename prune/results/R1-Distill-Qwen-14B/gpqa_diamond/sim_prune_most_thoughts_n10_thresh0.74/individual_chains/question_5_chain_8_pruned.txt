Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me see. Alright, the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I need to find the normalized eigenvector elements.

Wait, the question gives me the components of the operator P. So Px, Py, and Pz are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write those down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that's like σx, the Pauli matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is σz.

Wait, but the operator P here is probably the component along a specific direction. Oh, wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator would be P = P_x n_x + P_z n_z, since the direction is in the x-z plane, so n_x and n_z are the components of the unit vector in that plane. Wait, but n is arbitrary, so the direction can be any angle θ in the x-z plane. So the operator would be a combination of Px and Pz.

Wait, but I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvector should be an eigenstate of P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, since the direction is arbitrary, perhaps the eigenvector is expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of spin-1/2 particles because the matrices are 2x2, which correspond to spin states.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the spin operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. Here, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so it's the spin-up state along direction n.

The general form for eigenstates along an arbitrary direction is cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ
