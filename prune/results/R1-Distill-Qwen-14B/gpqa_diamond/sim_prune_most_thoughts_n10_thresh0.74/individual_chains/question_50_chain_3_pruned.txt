Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

The question says that a colleague has a quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime and is working on regularizing higher-order loop diagrams. There's this scribbled note with a formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And the task is to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and contributes to the complexity of the integral in perturbation theory.

Let me break down the formula. The formula is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. So, the exponents on the constants might indicate the number of loops.

I think each loop brings in a factor of the coupling constant. For example, in QED, a one-loop process (like the photon self-energy) would have alpha (which is e^2/(4pi)) to the first power. Wait, but wait. Wait, alpha is itself proportional to e^2/(4pi), so it's a dimensionless coupling. So for each loop, the power of alpha increases.

Wait, but Feynman diagrams with more loops have higher orders. Let's think about the superficial degree of divergence. Or maybe it's more straightforward to think about the power counting for loops.

Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the loop integral, which in dimensional regularization might come with factors of momenta or energies. But in terms of the coupling constants and the overall scaling, each loop brings in a factor proportional to the coupling raised to some power, multiplied by some logs or powers of the energy scale.

Wait, another angle: the formula given probably represents the order of the term in the perturbative expansion. The number of loops is equal to the order minus the tree level (which is zero loops). So, if the term is of order alpha^3 g^2, that would correspond to a certain number of loops.

Wait, but how does each loop contribute to the power of alpha and g? Let's think about a simple example
