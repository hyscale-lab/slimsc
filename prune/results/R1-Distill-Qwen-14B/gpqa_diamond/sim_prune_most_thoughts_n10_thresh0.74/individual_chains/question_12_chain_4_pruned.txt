Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay. The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? So the pion is at rest when it decays into a muon and a neutrino. 

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the energy and momentum are shared between the decay products. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in many cases, especially in beta decay, the neutrino is considered massless. So perhaps here, the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the others. So I can approximate it as zero. That should simplify things.

So the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays, this energy is converted into the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Because energy is conserved.

But wait, energy includes both rest mass and kinetic energy. So the total energy after decay should equal the initial energy before decay. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino should be 13
