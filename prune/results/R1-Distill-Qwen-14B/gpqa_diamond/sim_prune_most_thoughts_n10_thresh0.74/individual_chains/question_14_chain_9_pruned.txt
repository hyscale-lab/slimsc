Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question says that they did a ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed samples using an antibody against IKAROS, a transcription factor in human B cells. Then they aligned and did peak-calling, and they got some peaks. But when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. So the question is where are these disappearing peaks likely located?

Wait, what's the difference between PFA and PFA+DSG fixation? I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinking agent. It's often used to fix proteins to DNA because formaldehyde can crosslink proteins and other molecules. But sometimes, for certain applications, you might use additional agents. DSG, I think, is dithiothreitol. Oh right, DSG is a reducing agent. It's used to break disulfide bonds. So maybe in some cases, you need to use it with PFA to get better crosslinking or to modify the crosslinking.

Wait, but why would using DSG cause peaks to disappear? Let me think about how ChIP-seq works. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, shearing the DNA, and then immunoprecipitating the protein-DNA complexes to find where the protein binds. If the crosslinking isn't done properly, you might not get the right DNA regions pulled down, leading to missing peaks.

So, in this case, when they used PFA without DSG, they saw peaks, but when they added DSG, those peaks went away. That suggests that the PFA+DSG fixation might have crosslinked more efficiently or in a different way. Or perhaps it's about what regions are more susceptible to crosslinking in one method versus the other.

I remember that certain regions of the genome are more prone to crosslinking. For example, regions that are more open, like active promoters and enhancers, might crosslink better. But wait, if PFA without DSG leads to more crosslinking in certain regions, but DSG changes that, maybe in some regions the crosslinking is not as effective.

Alternatively, maybe DSG affects the accessibility of certain DNA regions. I think that DSG can help in the solubilization of the chromatin. Wait, no, DSG is used during the crosslinking
