Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options given are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is a way to determine the degree of unsaturation in a molecule. Each degree of unsaturation corresponds to one ring or one double bond or one triple bond, or two each for each triple bond. So, the formula to calculate it is:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But wait, in this case, the molecule doesn't have any halogens or nitrogens, so X and N are zero.

So first, I need to figure out the structure of the starting compound and then what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, what's the starting material again? 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Okay, let me draw that out mentally. A cyclohexene ring (so a six-membered ring with one double bond) substituted at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (a CHO group), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached). So the cyclohexene has double bonds at positions 3 and maybe another? Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I think.

So the structure: cyclohexene ring with double bond at 3-ene. Then, substituents at positions 2 and 5. At 2, a formyl (CHO) group, and at 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the substituent is a vinyl group, which itself has a double bond.

So the molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl group attached at position 5.

So the starting molecule's structure is such.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, that's the reaction where PCl5 or other halogens are used, but wait, red phosphorus and HI usually is a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination. Wait, no, wait. I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, maybe it's for the elimination of certain groups. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used in the deoxygenation of ketones or aldehydes. Or wait, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction? Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe it's the Wolff-Kishner reaction? No, Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat with a strong base, usually for ketones. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the reaction where a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) is reduced. But red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh wait! I think that's the method for the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, no, the Clemmensen uses zinc amalgam and hydrochloric acid. Red phosphorus with HI isn't the same. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction where a carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group. I think that's the process when using red phosphorus and HI. Let me think again.

Wait, when aldehydes or ketones react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a process called the Stephen reduction.
