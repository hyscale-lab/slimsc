Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincaré, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, let me think. I remember that the SMEFT is built by considering all possible operators that are consistent with the Standard Model's symmetries. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? Well, the Standard Model has gauge symmetries like SU(3), SU(2), U(1), but also some global symmetries. But in terms of spacetime symmetries, it respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and I think CPT symmetry as well. But wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.

Oh right, Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So in the Standard Model, the theory is Poincaré invariant. So SMEFT, as an effective theory, should also respect these symmetries because it's built from the Standard Model. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. So that would mean options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The Standard Model is approximately CP symmetric, but not exactly because of things like the CKM phase leading to CP violation. So SMEFT would include operators that are consistent with that. Wait, does the SMEFT enforce CP symmetry? Or are operators allowed to violate CP as long as they don't conflict with the Standard Model's structure.

I think in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, so the theory as a whole doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. For example, operators of higher dimension can have terms that explicitly violate CP if the Standard Model allows for such terms. So, CP isn't a symmetry that SMEFT must respect for all operators. So option 3 is out.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, all renormalizable theories are CPT symmetric. But I'm not sure about effective theories. Wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, but CPT symmetry is usually a fundamental symmetry. So I think in SMEFT, operators must respect CPT symmetry. Because without that, the theory might not be unitary
