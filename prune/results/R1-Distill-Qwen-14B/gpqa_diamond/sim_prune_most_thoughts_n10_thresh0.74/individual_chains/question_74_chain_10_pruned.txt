Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is about the probability of a single atom decaying. They mentioned that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, does that affect the probability for the next 150? My initial thought is that it shouldn't. Because each event is independent; the past doesn't influence the future in radioactive decay.

But wait, let me make sure. The way the question is phrased: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that it decays within the first 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have already gone by. So, what's the remaining time? 100 minus 50 is 50, but the question is about the next 150 minutes, which is more than the initial 100.

Wait, no. Let me parse the question again. Oh, I see. So the initial decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed. So how much time is left? Well, the initial 100 minutes is the time frame they're considering for the 32% probability. Now, an additional 150 minutes are being considered. So, the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay process is exponential, so the probability is based on the time elapsed. The decay follows an exponential law, so the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Wait, the 32% decay probability in 100 minutes. So that's the probability P that it decays within 100 minutes. So P = 0.32 = 1 - e
