Okay, I have this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. So, the question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is given, and I need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. I think the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, right, the formula is often given as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B), where l_p is the Planck length. Oh wait, actually, I think more accurately, the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Or maybe that's the same thing since l_p squared is ħ G / c^2. Yeah, because l_p = sqrt(ħ G / c^3), so l_p squared is ħ G / c^2. So the area A is π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. Right, the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c^2. So the area would be 4 π R_s^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4. Hmm, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

So I need to find the area A first. To find A, I need the radius of the event horizon. The event horizon's radius is the Schwarzschild radius, which is R = 2 G M / c². So A = 4 π R² = 4 π (2 G M / c²)^2 = 16 π G² M² / c^4.

But wait, I don't have the mass M directly. The question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. So I can find the actual size of the event horizon by using the formula θ (in radians) ≈ d * (R) / d ≈ R/d? Wait, no, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, but only when R is much smaller than d, which is true here since d is 1e10 parsecs and the event horizon is probably a
