Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read it again.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The peak wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's probably about blackbody radiation and Wien's Law. Oh wait, Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too.

Wait, but wait. Since Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are equal. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, both stars have the same temperature because their peak wavelengths are the same. So since L is proportional to R² T^4, and T is the same, L is proportional to R squared. So since R1 is 1.5 R2, L1 should be (1.5)^2 times L2. Let me compute that: 1.5 squared is 2.25. So that would make L1 =
