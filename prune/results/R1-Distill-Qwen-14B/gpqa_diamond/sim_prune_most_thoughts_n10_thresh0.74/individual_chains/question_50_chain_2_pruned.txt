Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams, and I'm supposed to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the perturbative order. Each loop typically corresponds to a higher order in the expansion, usually involving more vertices or propagators. The expression given is an estimate of the size, so it's probably related to the amplitude or the contribution of the diagram.

The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Breaking this down, alpha is the fine-structure constant, usually about 1/137. g is the coupling constant for some interaction, maybe like the strong force or electromagnetism. The sqrt(2) and 8 are numbers that might come from symmetry factors or combinatorial factors in the diagram. The 1/(4pi)^6 part is interesting. I know that in loop integrals, factors of (4pi)^something often show up, especially in higher dimensions or with more loops.

Wait, the dimension here is four-dimensional spacetime, which is our usual case. Each loop integral typically contributes a factor of (4pi)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, each loop integral might bring in a 4pi factor from the integration over the loop momentum. Or perhaps it's from the measure in the loop integrals, which in 4D would involve (4pi)^2 or something like that.

Wait, another approach: Each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^something in the denominator, depending on the integral's dimension. For a loop integral in 4D, say for a scalar loop, the integral often has factors like (4pi)^2 times something else. But I'm not getting it exactly.

Alternatively, I remember that the general scaling for the amplitude of a Feynman diagram is something like (coupling)^n * (loop factors) * (momentum scales)^something. The number of loops is connected to the number of vertices minus the number of propagators plus something else, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, I think a helpful approach is to think
