Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. Hmm, right, dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum, so I remember that selection rules are involved here.

Wait, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? Oh wait, but for s-electrons, like when l=0, the m is 0. So when l=0, the possible transitions must change l by ±1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The first transition must go to a state with l=1 because l can change by ±1. So from l=0 to l=1. So the possible m for the first transition would be m=0, 1, or -1, but wait, no, the change in m is limited to ±1 or 0. So for the first step, from m=0, the next m can be +1, 0, or -1. Oh, but wait, because in the first step, from |3,0,0⟩, the next state must have l=1, so it's |n', 1, m'⟩.

Now, the first transition can go to either |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩, I think. Because n can change by any number, as long as energy allows. So the possible n after first transition could be 2 or 4, but wait, from n=3, when you emit a photon, you go to a lower energy level, so maybe n=2 is the target for the first transition. Because from 3→2, and then 2→1.

Wait, but the question says it decays via two dipole transitions. So from 3→something, then to 1. So the first transition is from 3 to 2, perhaps. But wait, what about the possible m states?

Looking at the options, some of them go from 3→2, others from 3→2. Let's see the options:
