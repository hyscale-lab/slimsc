Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Oh wait, that's an interesting matrix. So for a 2x2 system, it would be a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, let's think: for a 2x2 matrix, A_12 and A_21 would be hbar/2, and the diagonals A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix looks like this:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, that's a matrix that swaps the states or something. Oh wait, actually, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply each element by hbar/2, that's our matrix A.

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A. Because the measurement probabilities are based on the eigenstates of this operator.

So, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of A as well. Let me recall: the eigenstates of the Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Right, so the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when you apply the X matrix to them, you get eigenvalues plus and minus 1, respectively.

But wait, in this case, our matrix A has elements that are hbar/2, so the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), right? Because A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.
