Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots had formed. The question is asking which of the options could be the structures of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction. But wait, the starting material here is an ether with a benzene ring and an alkenyl group attached through an oxygen. So the structure is something like benzene-O-(CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?), but wait no, the actual structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that.

The butenyl group is four carbons long. The substituents are on the second carbon: two methyl groups (so 2,2-dimethyl). The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, counting from the oxygen. So the structure is O-Bz-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the third and fourth carbon? Wait no, wait. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl: the en is at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Let me count. For but-3-en-1-yl, the chain is four carbons, with the substituent (the oxygen) on the first carbon. The double bond starts at the third carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Oh wait,
