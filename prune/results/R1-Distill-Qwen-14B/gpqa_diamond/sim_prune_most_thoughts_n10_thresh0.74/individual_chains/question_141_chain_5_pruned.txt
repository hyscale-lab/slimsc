Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, wait. Wait a minute. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Because benzene doesn't have a 1 and 2 positions if it's a benzene ring. Oh wait, wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Because sometimes "d" can stand for a substituent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene. Because sometimes in such problems, the substituents are arranged in a way that allows for certain reactions.

Wait, but the main point is the structure. Let me think: the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, in benzene, the bromine is at position 1, and another group (probably deuterium or something) at position 2. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2
