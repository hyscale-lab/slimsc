Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO and HIRES have different magnitude limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, they can observe stars up to 17 mag, right? Wait, no—wait a second. Oh wait, if the magnitude is brighter than 17, that means the star is fainter than 17? Wait, no, no! Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 17 is dimmer than a magnitude of, say, 10. So, if ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means stars with V magnitudes less than or equal to 17 can be detected. Because 17 is the limit. Same for HIRES: they can observe up to 16 mag. So stars with V mag ≤16.

Wait, no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So, brighter than 17 means lower magnitude numbers. So, ESPRESSO observes stars with V_mag < 17. Similarly, HIRES observes stars with V_mag <16. So, to be detected by both, the
