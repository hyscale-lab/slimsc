Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully.

So, the question is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that's heated. The total weight is 7.20 grams. After heating, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through several tubes, and we get some data about weight gains and losses. The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, let's break down the information given. The gases pass through three tubes:

1. Tube №1 with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So, Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, I think. It absorbs water. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, the tube would gain weight. And according to the results, tube 1 gained 3.60 grams. That suggests that the gas mixture has water vapor which is absorbed here.

2. Tube №2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is also a base, so it can react with acidic gases. If the gas mixture has CO2, for example, it would react, and the weight would change. But the result says the weight didn't change. So maybe no CO2 in the gas? Or perhaps the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, but CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. So if tube 2's weight didn't change, maybe the gas doesn't have CO2. Or perhaps the gas is something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2.

3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper. The gas passes through this, and the tube's weight increases by 0.80 grams, with CuO formed. Red-hot copper reacting with a gas to form CuO suggests that the gas is probably CO (carbon monoxide), since CO would react with Cu at high temperatures to form CuO and CO2. Alternatively, it could be H2, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that the gas is H2O vapor, but that doesn't make sense because H2O wouldn't react with copper. Oh wait, no, maybe if the gas is a reducing agent. So perhaps the gas is a mixture of CO and something else.

Wait, let me think again. When a gas passes through red-hot copper, and the copper gains weight, it's typically because the gas is oxidizing. For example, if the gas is O2, Cu would react, but I don't think that's likely because we've already passed through the other tubes. Alternatively, if the gas is CO, it can react with Cu to form CuO and CO2. Let me think about the reaction:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is more accurately written as:

CO + Cu → CuO + CO2? No, wait, I think the balanced equation is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. No, that's not balanced. Let me try again. The correct reaction is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO₂ ?

Wait, that's not balanced. Let me balance it properly.

CO + Cu → CuO + CO
