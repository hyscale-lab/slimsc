Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are usually unsaturated, like alkenes or alkynes. These can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms another equimolar mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh wait, the question says it's a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when one element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe the initial compound has elements with the same oxidation state, and then they split into different oxidation states.

After that, both mixtures X and Y undergo hydrogenation under severe conditions with platinum, giving only one substance Z. This Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let me calculate what that means. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(molar mass) = 14.28% = 0.1428.

Also, Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Hmm, common solvents include things like toluene, benzene, maybe something like hexane or heptane? But wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So hydrogenation doesn't add more H's, meaning Z is probably a fully saturated compound, maybe an alkane, since alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions unless in the presence of a catalyst, but if no further reaction, it's likely a saturated molecule.

Wait, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon. Let me think about the hydrogen percentage. So, let's find the molecular formula of Z.

Let me denote the molecular formula of Z as CnHm.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 0.1428.

Let me rearrange that equation. 

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428
Multiply both sides by denominator:
m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)
m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m
m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n
0.8572m ≈ 1.7136n
Hmm, maybe approximate 0.8572 as 6/7? Because 6/7 is about 0.8571. Let me check:

6/7 ≈ 0.8571. Yes. So,

6/7 * m ≈ 1.7136n

Multiply both sides by 7:

6m ≈ 12n (since 1.7136 *7 ≈ 12)

So 6m ≈ 12n → m ≈ 2n

So m is twice the number of carbons. So the formula is CnH2n. Wait, that's the formula for an alkene. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, which would add H's. Wait, wait, the hydrogenation is of Y and X, giving Z. So if Y is a mixture of products after a disproportionation, and hydrogenation leads to Z, which doesn't react further.

Wait, perhaps Z is an alkane. Because if it's an alkane, it's CnH2n+2. Let me check that.

If Z is CnH2n+2, then mass fraction H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = (n+1)/(7n +1).

Set this equal to 0.1428:

(n+1)/(7n +1
