Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D relativistic scenario. The spring follows Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², right? So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv², setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things might be different.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. The equations for kinetic energy change in relativity. The total energy E of a relativistic particle isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, the problem says the oscillator obeys Hooke's law. So the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy would be relativistic. Hmm. Let me think about energy conservation in this scenario.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma -1)mc², so maybe the approach is different.

Wait, wait. Oh, right, the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy. So when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E is then (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy, mc²? Or is it just the sum? Wait, I'm
