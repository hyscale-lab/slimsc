Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. It gives some parameters about their sizes, masses, and velocities. The main point is about their luminosities based on some black body radiation.

So, let's parse the details. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the mass part—does that matter here? Because the question is about luminosity, which I think is more related to radius and temperature. But I'll keep that in mind in case it comes into play elsewhere.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if b is the same for both, then T = b / lambda_max. So T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal. That's an important point.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; if moving away, redshifted. But since Star_1's radial velocity is zero, its observed wavelength isn't shifted. Star_2 is moving, so its observed wavelength would be different. But wait, the problem says they found the same wavelength at which they appear brightest. So maybe the Doppler effect has to be considered when comparing their actual temperatures?

Wait, no. Because when astronomers determine the star's temperature, they correct for Doppler shift. Because the peak wavelength they measure is the observed one, but the star's actual temperature would be based on the emitted peak. So for Star_2, which is moving, its emitted peak is at the same lambda as Star_1's, but due to Doppler shift, the observed lambda is different. But the problem states that the observed lambda maxima are the same. So perhaps I need to correct for the Doppler shift to find the actual temperatures?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So lambda1_observed = lambda2_observed. But because Star_2 is moving, its emitted lambda is shifted. So T1 and T2 are different, but the observed lambda_max is the same. So we have to correct for velocity to find the actual temperatures.

Ah, right. Because the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler effect. So, the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), approximately, assuming v_r is much less than the speed of light. Or wait, maybe it's more accurate to use the relativistic Doppler shift formula. Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation for small velocities, which is delta lambda / lambda = v_r / c, but that's for redshift or blueshift. For the peak wavelength, the actual emitted wavelength is shifted.

Wait, let me clarify. The peak wavelength is a function of the star's temperature. The star's temperature is what determines its emitted wavelength. But when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So if the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the stars have different velocities, their actual temperatures must be different.

So, for Star_1: observed lambda_1 = emitted lambda_1 = b / T1, since radial velocity is zero, no shift.

For Star_2: observed lambda_2 = lambda_2_observed = emitted lambda_2 * Doppler factor.

But lambda_1_observed = lambda_2_observed. So,

lambda_1 = lambda_2_observed = lambda_2 * Doppler factor.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The observed lambda is lambda_emitted multiplied by sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) ), but I might have the sign wrong. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, which has v_r =700 km/s, so moving away, the observed wavelength would be lambda_2_observed = lambda_2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/(1 - v_r) ) ). But wait, the formula is actually a bit more precise. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) )

But wait, in this case, v_r is the radial velocity. If the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, we have to calculate the Doppler factor.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we can approximate v_r << c, so we can use the non-relativistic approximation. The formula then becomes lambda_observed ≈ lambda_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should instead consider that the observed wavelength is the emitted wavelength multiplied by (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for small velocities, z ≈ v_r / c.

But maybe it's better to use the exact formula. Let's calculate the Doppler
