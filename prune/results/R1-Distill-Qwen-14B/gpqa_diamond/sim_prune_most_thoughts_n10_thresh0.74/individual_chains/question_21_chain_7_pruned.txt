Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question talks about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main part is about two compounds and whether they show tautomerism or optical isomerism. Hmm, right, I remember that tautomerism has to do with the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a bond, like in keto-enol tautomerism. And optical isomerism is about whether a compound can have chiral centers, leading to enantiomers.

So the first part (A) is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? Wait, no, more accurately, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho, but structurally, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, wait, no. Wait, quinones are typically with two keto groups. Oh, wait, benzoquinone is, for example, a benzene ring with two ketone groups in para positions. So it's a diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Which would make it a cyclic triketone. So each of these has multiple ketone groups. 

Tautomerism usually occurs in compounds with adjacent keto and enol groups. For example, in a carbonyl group, if there's a hydrogen adjacent (like in a ketone with alpha H), it can tautomerize. But wait, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. So in benzoquinone, each ketone is at the para position. So each ketone in benzoquinone is attached to a benzene ring. Benzene is a conjugated system, but the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are attached to the ring. Wait, but the carbonyl group is R-C=O. So the carbonyl is on the benzene. The adjacent positions are the ring carbons, which are not CH2 or CH groups with alpha hydrogens. Oh wait, no. Wait, the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H
