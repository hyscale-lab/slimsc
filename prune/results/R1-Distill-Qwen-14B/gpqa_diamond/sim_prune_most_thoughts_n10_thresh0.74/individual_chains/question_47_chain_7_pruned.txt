Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out here.

First, the IR data. There's a strong band around 1720 cm-1. That usually suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. The medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 probably indicate N-H or O-H stretches. Since the formula includes an N, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine group.

Looking at the options, all of them have either an amide or ester group. Let me check each option:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: That would have an amide group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (amide I around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹?), but the given IR is higher at 1720, which might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a carbonyl similar to amide, so again, around 1650-1680. But the IR is 1720, which is higher. Hmm.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This sounds like an amide or ester. Wait, propionate is an ester (if attached to an oxygen). So, maybe an ester group and an amine group. The IR at 1720 would fit the ester. Also, amines have N-H stretches, which would fit the 3420 and 3325 peaks. So that's promising.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Benzoate ester would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm⁻¹. And the 4-aminobenzoate would have an amine group, giving N-H stretches. So this also fits.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → This is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → Broad singlet for 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest exchange with something, like an amine. Wait, but if it's an ester, the ethyl group's OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.3, maybe as a quartet or something else. Alternatively, if it's an amine, the NH2 protons could be here, but they're usually broad, but in the case of D, the ethyl benzoate would have an OCH2CH3 attached to the ester.

Wait, let me think again. The ethyl group in an ester is typically as OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4
