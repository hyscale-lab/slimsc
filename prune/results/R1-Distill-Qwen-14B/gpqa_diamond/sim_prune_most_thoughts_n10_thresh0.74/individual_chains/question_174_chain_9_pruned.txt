Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial mass M is splitting into two parts with combined rest mass 0.99M. That means some energy is released as kinetic energy, I suppose.

Wait, the rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So when it splits, the rest masses of the two fragments add up to 0.99 * M, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Oh, wait, but that would mean the mass loss is 3 GeV, which is the energy released. But wait, no, because in reality, mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting some of this wrong.

But the main point is to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and compare the correct relativistic calculation with the classical approximation. The question is, what's the difference between the two T1 values.

So, first, let me break down the problem.

Given:
- Initial nucleus mass M, rest energy 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: one has mass 2m, the other m (so that 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3). Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the fragments have rest masses of m and 2m, which are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So total rest mass is 0.99 M.

But wait, M is the rest mass, so 300 GeV. So m_rest1 =
