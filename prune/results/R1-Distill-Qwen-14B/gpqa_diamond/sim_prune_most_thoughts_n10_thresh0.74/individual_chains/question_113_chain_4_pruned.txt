Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break down each piece of information and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates the presence of either O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids, or maybe N-H like in amines. But since the question is about formula identification, and the options don't include N, it's probably O-H. So maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something like that.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or an aromatic ring or something else. Wait, 1650 could also be an aromatic ring with some conjugation or maybe an amide. Alternatively, I think that the 1700 is a C=O stretch. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with some electron-withdrawing groups, or perhaps a carbonyl in an aromatic ring, like an aromatic ketone. Alternatively, it could be a C=C stretching if there's a double bond. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So 1650 might be the C=C stretch. Or maybe an aromatic ring (like benzene) because aromatic rings have absorption around 1600-1450. Wait, but 1650 is a bit higher than typical for benzene, which is usually around 1600. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Oh, I'm a bit confused there.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond, possibly in an alkene or maybe part of a ring. The presence of vinyl protons suggests that the molecule has a CH2=CH group or maybe a substituent attached to a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm trying to think about what fragments would give 45. Common fragments include CH3O (31?), but wait, 45 is a more likely for something like (CH3)2O (which would be 45: 12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2O is (12*2) + (6) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. So that's 46, but the peak is at 45. Hmm. Another possibility: maybe a fragment like CH2O or something else. Or perhaps a carbonyl group with some substituents. Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene ion or something else. Wait, another thought: 45 could correspond to (CH3)CO, which is the acetyl
