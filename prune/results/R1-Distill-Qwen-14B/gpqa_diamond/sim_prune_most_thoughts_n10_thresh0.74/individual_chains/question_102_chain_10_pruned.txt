Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a mouse model and some fluorescent proteins. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a new ligand-receptor pair identified in neural crest cells, and they want to see their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. So, I know that coiled-coil structures are often involved in protein-protein interactions, so the ligand probably binds to the receptor's extracellular part.

The construct they made is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That means two genes (ligand and receptor) are in the same vector, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So ligand is first, then comes a stop with a loxP cassette. Then the receptor is at the 3', with eGFP at the C-terminus, but there's a stop in a lox2272 cassette before it. 

Wait, so the vector has ligand-STOP-LOXP, then IRES, then receptor-STOP-LOX2272, and then eGFP. Or wait, no. Let me think again. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after the IRES element, which in bicistronic vectors allows for internal ribosome entry, so the second gene can be expressed without a separate promoter, but I'm not too sure about that.

So the vector is designed to have two ORFs: ligand and receptor. The ligand is first, under CBA promoter, then after that, a stop with loxP. Then IRES, and then the receptor, which is followed by eGFP. Wait, no, the receptor is fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So the construct is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop with loxP. Then IRES, then receptor ORF with eGFP. So when Cre is present, it can recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites recognized by Cre. LoxP is a wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant that only allows recombination in one direction, I think. So in this setup, when Cre is expressed, it should delete the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

So after Cre is introduced, the ligand would be expressed from the CBA promoter, followed by a stop that's removed by Cre. Then, the IRES would drive the expression of the receptor, which is followed by another stop cassette that's also removed by Cre. So in the presence of Cre, both genes are expressed. Otherwise, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since CBA is a strong promoter), but the receptor would not because of the stop cassette.

The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so they can detect both ligand and receptor on Western blot. They transfected primary astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin, so that's a control for loading. So the construct is working in culture, meaning that when Cre is active, both ligand and receptor are expressed.

Now, the mouse model is homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So SOX10-Cre would drive the expression of Cre in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes, I think. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under a confocal microscope. They don't see a green signal. Green is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed. But wait, the lig
