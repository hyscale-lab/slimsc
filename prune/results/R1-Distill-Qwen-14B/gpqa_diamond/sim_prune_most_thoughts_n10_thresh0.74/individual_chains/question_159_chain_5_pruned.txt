Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, I think this has to do with the Lyman-alpha forest or some kind of absorption lines. Oh wait, quasars emit a lot of light, but sometimes their spectra show absorption features from intervening matter, like the intergalactic medium. 

Wait, the peak at 790 nm... 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Let me think about the Lyman-alpha line. The Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, at about 121 nm. But when this line is observed in a quasar's spectrum, it might be redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So if the observed wavelength is longer, it's been redshifted.

So, if the peak is at 790 nm, that's the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line. So the rest wavelength is 121 nm, and the observed is 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121)/121 = 669/121 ≈ 5.528. So z is about 5.5.

Wait, but wait. The peak is at 790 nm. Is that the Lyman-alpha emission line or some absorption? Quasars can have emission lines, and if the quasar is at high redshift, those lines would be shifted into the near-infrared. So this must be the Lyman-alpha emission line observed at 790 nm, which implies a redshift z = (790/121) - 1. Let me calculate that.

790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. So z is 5.5289, so about 5.53.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The parameters given are the Hubble constant (H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc), matter density parameter (Ω_m = 0.3), dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ = 0.7), and the universe is flat (so Ω_k = 0).

The comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Wait, yes, because in a flat universe, Ω_k is zero.

But wait, the comoving distance at a scale factor a=1 is the same as the distance at the current time. So for a quasar at redshift z, the comoving distance would be the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0*E(z')) dz'.

So I need to calculate the integral ∫0^z dz'/(E(z')) where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ).

Hmm, but I don't remember the exact formula. I think for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be approximated using certain methods or look-up tables, but I don't have the exact numbers in my head.

Wait, I remember that for various redshifts, the comoving distance scales with certain factors. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc (but that's with certain H0 values). Wait, but our H0 here is 70 km/s/Mpc. Let me think about the relation between H0 and the comoving distance.

The comoving distance is D_C = (c/H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the integral.

So, c is 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 is (3e5) /7
