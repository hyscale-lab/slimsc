Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about finding out by what factor one system is more massive than the other. 

Alright, so there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and their periods are given as 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. So the orbital period of each system is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. 

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Wait, RV amplitude relates to the velocity of the star due to the orbit around the center of mass. The bigger the mass of the companion, the bigger the velocity amplitude. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's moving less, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So if star A is more massive than star B, star B would have a larger velocity amplitude. 

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me denote them as K1 and K2. So K1 =10, K2=5. Similarly, system_2 has K1=15, K2=10. 

I remember that in a binary system, the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocity amplitudes. So mass1/mass2 = K2/K1. Because the more massive star moves slower. So for system_1, mass1/mass2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio. So the total mass of system_1 is (mass1 + mass2) = mass1 * (1 + 2) = 3 * mass1. Similarly, the individual masses are mass1 = (2/3) * total, mass2 = (1/3) * total.

Wait, but how do I relate this to the total mass of each system? I think I need to find the total mass for each system and then compare them.

Wait, I remember that the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes, the orbital period, and the masses. The formula is something like f(M) = (K^3 * P) / (245.08), but I might be getting the constants wrong. Alternatively, the mass function is given by f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ). But if the orbits are edge-on, which they are since we see eclipses, then sin i is 1, so that simplifies it. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, for each system, the mass ratio (q) is mass2/mass1. And since q = K1/K2, because q = M2/M1 = (v1)/(v2), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. Because the velocity is inversely proportional to mass. So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So q1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2/M1 = 2. So M1 is M1, M2 is 2*M1. So total mass is M1 + 2*M1 = 3 M1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So q2 = K1/K2 =15/10 =1.5. So M2/M1 =1.5, so M2=1.5 * M1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, M2 is the mass of the second star. So I think the mass ratio is M2/M1 = (v1)/(v2), because M is inversely proportional to velocity. So, yes, q = M2/M1 = K1/K2. So in system_2, q2 =15/10=1.5. So M2 =1.5 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, M1 here is the mass of the first star in system_2. But each system's M1 and M2 are different. Wait, maybe I should think of each system's individual components.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model each system and find the total mass.

Let me try another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But since we're dealing with two stars in each system, and the total mass is M1 + M2, perhaps we can relate the velocities and the periods.

Wait, but both systems have different periods. So system_1 has a period P1 = 2 years, system_2 has P2=1 year.

So for each system, let's denote the two stars as M1 and M2, with K1 and K2 as their respective RV amplitudes.

For system_1: K1 =10, K2=5, P1=2 years.

For system_2: K1=15, K2=10, P2=1 year.

Let me think about the relation between K and the masses. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M2) ) / (4π²) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (M1 + M2)^(1/3) * (P/ (2π))^ (1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the mass function. The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (K^3 * P) / (274.3), where K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) is the mass function in solar masses.

Wait, but the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

And since we have edge-on orbits (eclipsing), sin i =1. So f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But we don't know M1 and M2, but we can write equations for each system.

But perhaps that's complicated. Another approach: since in each system, the two stars orbit the center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1. Because the more massive star moves slower.

So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So K1/K2=2. So M2/M1=2 --> M2=2 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2=3 M1.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So K1/K2=1.5. So M2/M1=1.5 --> M2=1.5 M1. So total mass is M1 + M2=2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, M1 is the mass of the first star, which in system_1's case is a different M1. So I think I need to find each system's total mass in terms of their own masses, then compare.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model each system's total mass.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to realize that for each system, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2) × P^(1/3), but I'm not sure. Let me think again about the mass function.

Alternatively, using the formula for each star's velocity:

K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2) sin i / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But since sin i =1 for both, and we can set up ratios.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the mass function for each system and set up a ratio.

For system_1, the mass function f1 = (K1^3 * P1) / 274.3

Similarly, f2 = (K2^3 * P1) /274.3. Wait, no, wait. No, each star has its own K. So for system_1:

f1 for star 1: K1=10, P=2 years.

f1 = (10^3 * 2)/274.3 ≈ (1000 *2)/274.3 ≈ 2000/274.3 ≈ 7.29 solar masses.

But f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for the first star in system_1, f1 = M2^3 / (M_total^2 )

Wait, but for system_1, K1 and K2 are for each star, so each has their own mass function. But perhaps since K is inversely proportional to mass, and the mass function for each star gives the same f(M) because f(M) is a function of the system.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about system_1.

In system_1, the two stars have K1=10 and K2=5.

The mass function f(M) is the same for both stars, but calculated using either K1 or K2. Wait, no, because each K is a separate measurement. So for system_1, using K1=10, f1a = (10^3 * 2)/(274.3) ≈ (1000 *2)/274.3 ≈ 7.29.

Using K2=5, f1b = (5^3 *2)/274.3 = (125 * 2)/274.3 ≈ 250/274.3 ≈ 0.911.

But wait, both K1 and K2 give the same mass function for the system because f(M) is a function of the system's total mass and the individual masses. So why are the f(M) values different? That can't be right. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the mass function is the same regardless of which star you take. So maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the formula again. The mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (274.3) where K is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) in solar masses.

Wait, but for each star, the same system's mass function should be calculated, but perhaps for each star, the K is different, but f(M) should be the same because f(M) is a function of the system. So maybe I'm confusing the individual K's with the correct approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the velocities and the masses in a different way.

Let me consider the mass function formula for each system. Since we can’t determine the inclination (but in this case, it's known to be edge-on, so sin i =1).

In system_1:

K1 =10, K2=5. P=2 years.

The mass function for each star would be:

f1 = (K1^3 P)/(274.3) = (1000 * 2 ) /274.3 ≈ 7.29.

Similarly, f1b = (5^3 *2 )/274.3 = (125*2)/274.3 ≈ 0.91.

Wait, but this can't be right because the mass function should be the same for both stars in the same system. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the same f(M) for both, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute f(M) using each K and set them equal, but that would only be possible if K1 and K2 are related in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1+M2)^2 )

In system_1, K1=10, K2=5. Since K1/K2 = M2/M1, as discussed earlier.

So for system_1, K1/K2 =10/5=2. So M2 =2 M1.

So M_total = M1 + M2 =3 M1.

Then, f(M) = (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = ( (2 M1)^3 ) / ( (3 M1)^2 ) ) = (8 M1^3) / (9 M1^2) )= (8/9) M1.

So f(M) system_1 = (8/9) M1.

But f(M) can also be calculated from the mass function formula. Let's take K1=10:

f(M) = (10^3 * 2 ) / 274.3 ≈ 2000/274.3 ≈7.29 solar masses.

So 7.29 = (8/9) M1 → M1 = (7.29 *9)/8 ≈ (65.61)/8 ≈ 8.20125 solar masses.

So M_total system_1 =3 *8.20125 ≈24.60375 Msun.

Now let's do the same for system_2.

System_2: K1=15, K2=10, P=1 year.

K1/K2 =15/10=1.5 → M2=1.5 M1. So M_total = M1 + M2 =2.5 M1.

Now, f(M) for system_2 using K1=15:

f(M) = (15^3 *1 ) /274.3 → (3375 *1)/274.3 ≈12.299 solar masses.

But f(M) is also:

f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) → ( (1.5 M1)^3 ) / ( (2.5 M1)^2 ) = (3.375 M1^3) / (6.25 M1^2 ) )= (3.375/6.25) M1 = 0.54 M1.

So 0.54 M1 =12.299 → M1=12.299 /0.54 ≈22.776 Msun.

Then, M_total for system_2 is 2.5 * M1 =2.5 *22.776≈56.94 Msun.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Because in system_2, M_total =M1 + M2 = M1 +1.5 M1 =2.5 M1.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, M1≈22.776 Msun. So M_total system_2 ≈2.5 *22.776 =56.94 Msun.

Wait, but system_1's M_total is about 24.60 Msun, and system_2's is 56.94 Msun? That can't be right because the problem says to find how much more massive system_1 is than system_2. But according to this, system_2 is more massive. But the options don't include a factor less than 1 for system_1 being more massive. Wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, system_1: f(M) =7.29 from K1=10.

So 7.29 = (8/9) M1 → M1=7.29 *9 /8 =65.61 /8=8.20125.

M_total system_1=3 *8.20125=24.60375.

System_2:

f(M) using K1=15 is (15^3 *1 )/274.3=3375/274.3≈12.299.

f(M)= (M2^3)/(M_total^2).

M2=1.5 M1, M_total=2.5 M1.

So f(M)= ( (1.5 M1)^3 )/( (2.5 M1)^2 )= (3.375 M1^3 )/(6.25 M1^2 )= (3.375/6.25) M1=0.54 M1.

So 0.54 M1=12.299 → M1≈12.299/0.54≈22.776.

M_total system_2=2.5*22.776≈56.94 Msun.

Wait, that's a problem because system_2 is more massive, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If M1_system is 24.6 and system_2 is 56.94, then system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the options are about system_1 being more massive. So maybe I've messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that f(M) is the same for each star in a system, but in reality, for each star, the mass function is the same. So perhaps I should have taken the same f(M) for both stars in a system. Wait, no, the mass function is the same for the entire system, so using either star's K would give the same f(M). So perhaps I shouldn't have used both K1 and K2 for the same system. I think I should have only used one of them.

Wait, perhaps each system's f(M) is calculated using the same formula, using one of the K's. Let me try that.

So for system_1, using K1=10:

f(M1) = (10^3 * 2) /274.3 =2000 /274.3 ≈7.29 Msun.

And since f(M1) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

We also have K1/K2 = M2/M1 →10/5=2 → M2=2 M1.

So substituting M2=2 M1 into f(M1):

f(M1) = ( (2 M1)^3 ) / ( (3 M1)^2 ) ) = (8 M1^3) / (9 M1^2 )= (8/9) M1.

So 7.29 = (8/9) M1 → M1 =7.29 *9 /8 → approx (65.61)/8≈8.20125 Msun.

So M2=2*8.20125≈16.4025.

Total mass system_1: 8.20125 +16.4025=24.60375 Msun.

Now, system_2: K1=15, K2=10. So K1/K2=15/10=1.5 → M2=1.5 M1.

So f(M2)= (15^3 *1 ) /274.3=3375 /274.3≈12.299 Msun.

And f(M2)= (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )= ( (1.5 M1)^3 )/( (2.5 M1)^2 )= (3.375 M1^3 )/(6.25 M1^2 )= (3.375/6.25) M1=0.54 M1.

So 12.299=0.54 M1 → M1=12.299/0.54≈22.776 Msun.

M2=1.5 *22.776≈34.164 Msun.

Total mass system_2=22.776 +34.164=56.94 Msun.

So system_1 has a total mass of ~24.6 Msun, system_2 has ~56.94 Msun. So system_1 is about 24.6 /56.94 ≈0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but the question says, "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is 0.43 times system_2's mass, that would make it less massive. So the factor would be 0.43, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7.

So 0.43 is approximately 0.4, so option A.

But wait, wait. I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for system_1:

f(M) =7.29 = (8/9) M1 → M1=7.29 *9 /8=65.61 /8=8.20125.

M2=2*8.20125≈16.4025.

Total system_1: 24.60375 Msun.

System_2:

f(M) =12.299=0.54*M1 → M1=12.299/0.54≈22.776.

M2=1.5*22.776≈34.164.

Total=56.94.

So the ratio system_1 / system_2 =24.60375 /56.94 ≈0.431, which is about 0.4. So the answer should be option A) ~0.4.

But wait, the question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1's mass is 0.4 times system_2's, that would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4. But the options are about how much more massive system_1 is, which in this case, it's less. So would the answer be 0.4, implying system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2?

But the question says "how much more massive is system_1 than system_2?" Since system_1 is less massive, the factor would be less than 1, which is 0.4, which is option A.

So the answer should be A) ~0.4.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and masses in binary star systems.

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)

3. The mass ratio of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to the ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes:  
   \[
   \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{K_1}{K_2}
   \]

4. The total mass of the system is the sum of the masses of the two stars:  
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = M_1 + M_2
   \]

5. The mass function for a binary system is given by:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{(K^3 \cdot P)}{274.3}
   \]
   where \( K \) is in km/s, \( P \) is in years, and \( f(M) \) is in solar masses.

### Analysis:
#### **System_1**:
- From \( K_1/K_2 = 10/5 = 2 \), the mass ratio is \( M_2/M_1 = 2 \), so \( M_2 = 2M_1 \).
- Total mass:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 2M_1 = 3M_1
  \]
- Using \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \), the mass function is:  
  \[
  f(M_1) = \frac{(10^3 \cdot 2)}{274.3} \approx 7.29 \, M_\odot
  \]
- Substituting into \( f(M) = \frac{M_2^3}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \):  
  \[
  f(M_1) = \frac{(2M_1)^3}{(3M_1)^2} = \frac{8M_1^3}{9M_1^2} = \frac{8}{9}M_1
  \]
  Solving \( 7.29 = \frac{8}{9}M_1 \):  
  \[
  M_1 \approx 8.201 \, M_\odot, \quad M_2 \approx 16.403 \, M_\odot
  \]
  Total mass:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,1}} \approx 24.604 \, M_\odot
  \]

#### **System_2**:
- From \( K_1/K_2 = 15/10 = 1.5 \), the mass ratio is \( M_2/M_1 = 1.5 \), so \( M_2 = 1.5M_1 \).
- Total mass:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 1.5M_1 = 2.5M_1
  \]
- Using \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \), the mass function is:  
  \[
  f(M_2) = \frac{(15^3 \cdot 1)}{274.3} \approx 12.299 \, M_\odot
  \]
- Substituting into \( f(M) = \frac{M_2^3}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \):  
  \[
  f(M_2) = \frac{(1.5M_1)^3}{(2.5M_1)^2} = \frac{3.375M_1^3}{6.25M_1^2} = \frac{3.375}{6.25}M_1 = 0.54M_1
  \]
  Solving \( 12.299 = 0.54M_1 \):  
  \[
  M_1 \approx 22.776 \, M_\odot, \quad M_2 \approx 34.164 \, M_\odot
  \]
  Total mass:  
  \[
  M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 56.94 \, M_\odot
  \]

#### **Comparison**:
- The total mass of system_1 is \( M_{\text{total,1}} \approx 24.604 \, M_\odot \), and the total mass of system_2 is \( M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 56.94 \, M_\odot \).
- The ratio of the masses is:  
  \[
  \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{24.604}{56.94} \approx 0.43
  \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times** as massive as system_2. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4.

Answer: A
