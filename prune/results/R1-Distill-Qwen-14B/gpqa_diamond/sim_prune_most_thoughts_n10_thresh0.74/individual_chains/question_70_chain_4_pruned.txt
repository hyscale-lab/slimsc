Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to map out all the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. When C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let's try to deduce what these compounds could be.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The fact that 8 equivalents are used makes me think of something like sulfur reacting with multiple oxygen atoms, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps a metal reacting with chlorine? Wait, let me think. If B is a gas, it's probably a diatomic element like O2, Cl2, F2, etc.

Reaction 4: D reacts with B to form H in a 1:1 ratio. If H is a solvent, maybe it's something like H2O (but B is a gas, so if B is O2, then D could be H2, and H would be H2O. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, then D could be something else.

Wait, let's think about common solvents. H could be something like H2O, ethanol, etc. But considering reaction 4: D + B → H. Let's say B is Cl2. Then D could be something like H2 (but H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2. If B is O2, then reaction 4: D (could be H2) + O2 → H2O. That makes sense because H2O is a solvent.

Wait, but in reaction 4, it's a 1:1 ratio, so 1 mole of B reacts with 1 mole of D. So if B is O2, then D is H2, producing H2O. Or maybe D is another diatomic gas.

Wait, but if H is a solvent, H2O is a possibility. So if D is H2 and B is O2, then H is H2O. That makes sense. Let me note that.

So, reaction 4: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Wait, but the ratio is 1:1. So H2 and O2 in 1:1 ratio? Well, the balanced reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the mole ratio is 2 H2 to 1 O2. So if H is H2O, then reaction 4 would have H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm on the wrong path.

Let me think of another possibility. What if B is Cl2? Then perhaps D is H2. But H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then O2 and C would react to form CO or CO2. But that's not a solvent. Alternatively, D could be NH3. Wait, but NH3 is a gas, maybe. Or perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another angle. Looking at reaction 3: C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So C could be a compound that upon hydrolysis yields a metal oxide (which would form a corresponding acid) and another acid. Wait, but A is a solid; perhaps A is a metal oxide.

Alternatively, if C is a metal chloride, upon
