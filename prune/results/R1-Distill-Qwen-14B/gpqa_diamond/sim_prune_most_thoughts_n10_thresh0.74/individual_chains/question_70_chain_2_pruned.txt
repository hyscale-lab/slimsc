Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to understand all the clues.

So, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Oh, and gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Alright, I need to figure out what's going on here. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's think about the reactions. The first reaction is A + 8B → C. Since it's a solid reacting with gas to form another solid (since C is a product, and the colors are bright red, maybe a metal oxide or something similar). The second reaction is C + 2D → E, which is dangerous. The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong (like HCl) and G is weak (like H3PO4 or something similar). Also, D + B → H, a solvent. Hmm.

Let me think about possible compounds. The fact that C reacts with water to form A and two acids suggests that C is probably a salt that can hydrolyze. Also, when C is formed from A and B, maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? Or perhaps A is a metal oxide?

Wait, another angle. The reaction of D with B in a 1:1 ratio gives a solvent. Solvents could be things like H2O, ethanol, or something else. But D is a gas, and B is a gas as well. So when they react 1:1, perhaps it's something like D is NH3 and B is HCl, but wait, that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Or maybe D is HCl and B is NH3, but that also gives NH4Cl. Hmm, perhaps D is H2O, but then B would have to be something else. Alternatively, maybe D is SO3 and B is H2O, making H2SO4, but that's a strong acid, not a solvent. Wait, but H is used as a solvent. So H could be something like ethanol, or maybe something like H2O. Wait, H is a product of D and B, which are both gases. So if D and B are gases, their reaction could produce a liquid solvent. So, maybe D is HCl gas and B is NH3 gas. They react in 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid. That doesn't fit because H is a solvent, which is typically a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2S and B is Cl2. They react to form HCl and S? But that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is SO3, making H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a solvent. Hmm. Wait, another thought: D and B could be H2O and something else. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4
