Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a cyclic monoterpene alcohol or an alkene. Wait, no, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene, right? Oh wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. Let me clarify: limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure, but wait no... Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, more precisely, it's a bicyclic monoterpene? Hmm, maybe not. I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a terpene with a specific structure. Oh wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but more accurately, it's a bicyclic monoterpene. No, actually, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but not necessarily bicyclic. Let me just think about the structure.

(R)-(+)-Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, which is a bicyclic molecule. Wait, perhaps it's a bicyclic monoterpene, like a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. Wait, I think limonene is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene with two rings. Hmm,
