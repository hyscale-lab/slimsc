Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... Right, potential energy between charges. But wait, the sphere is conducting and it's grounded. Oh right, grounding means it's connected to the Earth, which is a conductor, so the sphere can have charges induced on it but any excess charge can flow away.

When you place a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. For a conducting sphere, the charges will move to the surface. And since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would adjust so that the sphere's potential is zero. Wait, no, because the sphere is grounded, the potential of the sphere is the same as the Earth's potential, which we take as zero.

So the sphere is a conductor. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere if needed, but wait, the sphere is neutral initially. Oh, wait, no, the sphere is neutral to begin with because it's just a conducting sphere. So when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges: negative on the near side and positive on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess charge can flow away. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. Let's say q is positive. Then the near side of the sphere will have induced negative charges, and the far side positive. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any excess charge can leave. So the induced charges on the sphere will adjust until the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the Earth's potential, which is zero.

Wait, but the problem is about the potential energy of the system. The system includes the charge q and the conducting sphere. The sphere is a conductor, so the charges on it will arrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero.

But the sphere is grounded, so any induced charges not canceled by the opposite charge can leave the sphere. So if the sphere was initially neutral, the presence of q would induce a redistribution. Let me think: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will arrange such that the potential of the sphere's surface is the same as the surrounding. But since it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the conducting sphere as a point charge when considering the potential outside. Because for a conducting sphere, the external electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Oh, right! That's the shell theorem. So, the external potential due to a conducting sphere is the same as that of a point charge located at the center.

But in this case, the sphere is grounded, so it's at zero potential. The charge q is placed at a distance d from the center. So the potential at the location of q due to the sphere would be something... Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the potential is the same everywhere on its surface, which is zero.

Wait, but the potential due to the sphere at a point outside (like where q is placed) is the same as that of a point charge. So, the sphere, being a conductor, can be treated as a point charge of whatever net charge it has at its center.

But wait, is there any net charge on the sphere? Initially, the sphere is neutral. When we bring charge q near it, the sphere will have induced charges, but because it's grounded, any excess charge can flow. So, if q is positive, the near side of the sphere would have induced negative charges, and the far side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, the positive charges can leave. So the sphere ends up with a net negative charge? Or wait, no, maybe not.

Wait, let's think. The induced charges are such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So, the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the external field due to q plus the induced charges cancels inside the conductor. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the potential energy of the system. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, one of the charges is a conducting sphere, which is complicated because it's a conductor.

Wait, but wait: when a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere that's grounded, the sphere's induced charges will adjust such that the potential on its surface is zero. So the sphere's net charge is zero? Because it's grounded, any induced charge can flow away. Wait, no, the sphere is initially neutral, but when you bring a charge near it, the sphere's induced charges are such that the net charge on the sphere depends on the surrounding.

Wait, no. Suppose the sphere is a conductor, so all charges reside on the surface. When a charge q is placed near it, the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential inside the conductor (which is zero) is maintained. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave. So, as the external charge q is positive, the near side of the sphere would have induced negative charges, and the far side positive. But because the sphere is connected to the ground, the positive charges in excess can leave the sphere. So the sphere ends up with a net negative charge? Or wait, maybe the sphere has an induced dipole or something.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this using method of images. The method of images is a technique used in electrostatics to solve problems involving conductors. For a point charge placed outside a conducting sphere, we can model the induced charges as an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, the method of images says that for a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be represented by an image charge placed at some point inside the sphere. The image charge's position and value are determined such that the potential due to the real charge and the image charge is zero on the surface of the sphere.

So, in this case, the real charge is q at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' would be located somewhere along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere. The image charge would have a value such that the sphere's surface is at zero potential.

Wait, but the image charge is inside the sphere, and the sphere is grounded. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the image charge approach is still valid.

So, according to the method of images, the image charge q' is located at a distance d' from the center, where d' = (R^2)/d. Wait, is that right? No, I think the image charge is placed on the opposite side of the sphere's center relative to q. So, if the real charge is at distance d from the center, the image charge would be at a distance d' = (R^2)/d from the center, but on the opposite side. Wait, no, correction: the image charge's distance from the center is R^2 divided by the distance of the real charge. So d_image = (R^2) / d. But since the image is inside the sphere, it's at a distance of R^2/d from the center, but perhaps in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, the formula for the image charge when a charge is outside a sphere is that the image is inside the sphere, at a distance of R^2 / d from the center, along the line connecting the center to the real charge. So, if the real charge is at a distance d, then the image is at R^2 / d distance on the same line but inside the sphere.

Wait, no, I think the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance from the center is R^2 / (d), but the direction is the same as q. Hmm, perhaps I should recall the formula.

In the method of images, for a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance of r' = R² / r from the center, where r is the distance of the real charge from the center. So, if the real charge is at distance d, then the image charge is at d' = R² / d, on the same side.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the formula. Suppose the sphere is at the origin, and the charge q is placed along the positive x-axis at (d, 0, 0). The image charge would then be inside the sphere at (d', 0, 0), where d' = R² / d. Because d is greater than R (since the charge is outside the sphere), d' would be less than R, meaning the image is inside.

So the potential energy of the system would then be due to the real charge and the image charge. But how does that help us find the net potential energy?

Wait, the potential energy of the system could be considered as the work done to bring the real charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, considering the potential due to the sphere.

Alternatively, since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential energy of the charge q in the potential of the sphere is the same as the potential at the point where q is placed multiplied by q.

Wait, no. The potential energy U is q times the potential at that point due to the sphere.

But the sphere's potential at any point outside is the same as a point charge located at the center with charge Q. But in this case, since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential outside the sphere at a distance r is V(r) = (k Q) / r. But at r = R, this potential must be zero, so Q must be zero. Wait, that can't be right because then the sphere wouldn't have any effect.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. If the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So the potential due to the sphere at any point in space is the same as that of a conductor with potential zero.

Wait, but the potential outside a conducting sphere of radius R with charge Q is V = (k Q) / r. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the surface (r=R) must be zero. So, V(R) = (k Q) / R = 0 => Q=0. So the sphere must have zero charge? That can't be right because then the induced charges would not be present.

Wait, no. The sphere is initially neutral, but when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charges would adjust such that the net potential on the sphere is zero. But perhaps the sphere ends up with a charge Q such that the potential at its surface is zero when considering both the real charge and the induced charges.

Wait, no, I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try another approach. The conducting sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. The potential at any point outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials due to the sphere's charge and any other charges.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's charge is zero because it's grounded and neutral. Hmm, no, because when you bring a charge near it, the sphere's induced charges can't leave because the sphere is neutral. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor connected to the ground, so any induced charges can leave.

Wait, perhaps the sphere has zero net charge because it's neutral to start with, and the induced charges are such that the net charge remains zero. So, when you bring a charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges are -q on the near side and +q on the far side, but because the sphere is connected to ground, the +q can leave the sphere, leaving a net -q on the sphere. But wait, that would mean the sphere has a net charge. But wait, the sphere was initially neutral, so if it's grounded, any induced charges would adjust such that the sphere remains neutral. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's net charge remains zero. So the induced charges are -q near the charge and +q on the opposite side, but because the sphere is grounded, those +q charges can leave the sphere, leaving the sphere with a net -q near and 0 on the far side. Wait, no, because the sphere would have a net charge of -q if that's the case, but that can't happen because the sphere is neutral and grounded.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the image charge. The image charge approach for a conducting sphere says that when a charge q is outside, the induced charges can be modeled as an image charge inside the sphere at a distance d' = R² / d from the center, along the line connecting the center to q. The image charge has a value of q' = q (R² / d²) / (1 + (R² / d²)) )? No, I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is given by q' = (R^2 / d^2) * q. But wait, I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, the image charge would be such that the sphere's surface is an equipotential. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the image charge must be placed to cancel the potential on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps the image charge has a value of q' = q (R / d), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the image charge q' is given by q' = (R^2 / d^2) q. So if the real charge is at distance d, the image charge is at d' = R^2 / d, and its magnitude is q' = (R^2 / d^2) q.

Wait, I think I've heard that the image charge is q' = (R² / d²) q, but I'm not certain. Let's proceed with that assumption for now.

So, the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance d' = R² / d from the center, and has a charge q' = (R² / d²) q.

Wait, but let me double-check. The image charge method for a sphere of radius R: the image charge is located at a distance r' = R^2 / r from the center, and has charge q' = (R^2 / r^2) q, where r is the distance of the real charge from the center. So yes, that seems right.

So, the sphere's induced charges can be modeled as an image charge q' = q (R² / d²) at a distance of R²/d from the center.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so how does that affect this image charge? Oh, because the sphere is grounded, the image charge might not apply the same way. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem by calculating the potential energy of the system as the work done in assembling the charges.

The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere. But the sphere being conducting and grounded complicates things because it can have induced charges.

Wait, another approach. The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies due to each pair of charges. In this case, the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential energy of the system is the potential energy of q in the electric field of the sphere, plus the potential energy stored in the induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere being a conductor, the induced charges are such that the potential inside is zero. So the potential outside the sphere due to these charges would be the same as if all the induced charges were at the center.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential outside the sphere is V = (k Q) / r, where Q is the net charge on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded and initially neutral, I think Q must be zero. But that doesn't make sense because bringing a charge near would induce charges.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption here. Let's think again: a conducting sphere is neutral and grounded. When a charge q is placed near it, the charges redistribute on the sphere. The sphere's net charge must be zero because any induced charges can leave via the ground. Wait, no, because if the sphere was a conductor connected to the ground, any excess charge can leave, so the sphere's net charge will adjust to match the image charge.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, the sphere's net charge is zero. But then how does the charge q affect the potential energy?

I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the potential energy in terms of the external charge and the induced charges.

The potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to the point d, considering the potential due to the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but if the potential at the surface is zero, and the potential decreases as we move away from a positive charge, or increases if it's negative. So the potential at d would be due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But earlier, I thought the potential outside the sphere due to the sphere's induced charge is the same as a point charge at the center. So, if the sphere has a net charge Q, then the potential at d would be V = (k Q) / d.

But if the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So at the surface of the sphere (r=R), V=0. So, (k Q)/R = 0 => Q=0. That suggests the sphere has zero net charge, which would mean the potential at d is zero. But that can't be right because that would make the potential energy zero, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The sphere's induced charges are due to the charge q. So the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential on its surface is zero. But the potential at the surface is due to both the induced charges and the charge q.

Wait, but the sphere being conducting ensures that the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. And since it's grounded, that potential is zero.

So the potential at the surface due to all charges (q and induced) must be zero.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the induced charges as a point charge Q at the center. Then, the total potential at the sphere's surface (r=R) is V_sphere = V_q + V_induced.

But V_sphere must be zero, so (k q) / d + (k Q) / R = 0.

So, (q)/(d) + (Q)/R = 0 => Q = - q R / d.

Wait, that makes sense. So the induced charge on the sphere would be Q = - (q R)/d.

So the sphere, being neutral, but under the influence of q, has an induced charge of Q = - q R/d at its center.

Wait, but wait. The sphere is conducting, so all the charge resides on the surface. So treating the sphere as a point charge at the center is valid for external points. So, the potential outside the sphere is due to this induced charge Q = - q R/d.

So, the potential at the location of charge q (which is at distance d) is due to the sphere's induced charge Q. Since the sphere's potential at any external point is k Q / d.

So the potential V at the position of q is V = (k Q)/d.

But Q is the induced charge on the sphere, which is Q = - (q R)/d. So,

V = k (- q R/d) / d = - k q R / d².

The potential energy U is q times this potential, so U = q * V = q * (-k q R / d²) = -k q² R / d².

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²) → no, this has d in numerator.

Option B: U= -k q² d/(d² - R²) → no, again different.

Option C: U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²) → denominator has d²-R², numerator R².

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²) → no, denominator is d²-R², numerator R.

Hmm, none of the options match my result of U= -k q² R / d².

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me go back.

When I set the potential at the sphere's surface to zero, I considered the potential due to q and the induced charge Q. So,

V_sphere = (k q) / R + (k Q) / R = 0.

Ah! Wait, wait a second. The potential at the sphere's surface due to charge q is (k q) / R, because the sphere's radius is R, so the distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface is approximately the same as d. Wait, no. If the charge q is placed at a distance d from the center, the distance from q to a point on the sphere's surface near q would be d - R, and on the opposite side, it would be d + R. Wait, but for the potential, we can approximate it as a dipole field if the charge is far away, but in this case, when finding the potential on the sphere's surface, it's more accurate to model q as a point charge at distance d from the center, so the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to q is k q / r, where r is the distance from q to that point on the sphere.

But the sphere is a conductor, so the potential due to induced charges (which are on the sphere's surface) must be such that the sum of potentials is zero at the surface.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the potential at the sphere's surface due to the charge q as being uniform, but that's not correct. The potential due to q varies on the sphere's surface, but the induced charges redistribute to make the sum of potentials zero everywhere on the surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's induced charges can be considered as a dipole, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about this again.

The sphere is conducting and grounded. When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

The potential at the surface of the sphere is the sum of the potential due to q and the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. But because the sphere is a conductor, the potential due to the induced charges must be uniform across the surface. So, the induced charge can be considered as a point charge at the center, which we'll call Q.

So, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is V1 = k q / R, since the sphere's radius is R and q is at distance d. Wait, no, that's only if the charge is at the center, but in reality, the charge is at distance d from the center. So the potential at the surface isn't just k q / R.

Wait, perhaps I should use the shell theorem here. The potential due to a charge outside a sphere at any point on the sphere's surface can be found as if the charge is located at the center. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the potential at the sphere's surface due to the external charge q is k q / d, because the sphere's radius is R, and the charge is at distance d from the center. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. The potential due to a charge q at a distance d is k q / d.

Wait, but the sphere's surface is at radius R, so the potential at the surface due to q would be approximately k q / d, because d is the distance from the center, not from the surface.

Hmm. So the potential at the surface due to q is V1 = k q / d.

The sphere's induced charge Q (at its center) would create a potential V2 = k Q / R at the surface.

So the sum of these potentials must be zero, because the sphere's surface is at zero potential (grounded).

So, V1 + V2 = 0 => (k q) / d + (k Q) / R = 0.

Solving for Q: (k Q)/R = - (k q) /d → Q = - (q R) / d.

So the induced charge Q is - (q R)/d.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charge Q.

Wait, but what's the potential at the position of q (distance d from center) due to Q? Since Q is located at the center, the potential at d is V = k Q / d.

So, V = k * (- q R/d) / d = - k q R / d².

The potential energy U is the charge q multiplied by this potential, so U = q * (-k q R/d²) = -k q² R / d².

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is not just the charge times the potential, but includes the work done in assembling the induced charges as well. Oh wait, that's another possibility. Because the induced charges on the sphere also contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, the potential energy U of the system could be the work done to bring q from infinity and also the work done to bring the induced charges onto the sphere.

Hmm, but the sphere is grounded, so the induced charges are at zero potential. So perhaps the potential energy comes only from the interaction between q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere and are at zero potential, so the potential energy would be the work done in assembling them, but since they are induced, I think that's already accounted for when calculating the potential at the location of q.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is half of the product of the charge and the potential it creates. Wait, no, that's for a capacitor. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The potential energy U of a system of charges is the work done to assemble those charges. In this case, the charges are q and the induced charges Q on the sphere. But since the sphere is neutral and grounded, the net charge on the sphere is zero. So the induced charges are Q and -Q, but how does that affect the potential energy?

Wait, but in reality, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential energy is the work done by bringing the charge q into the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere's induced charges are Q = - (q R)/d at the center, and the potential at the location of q (distance d) is V = k Q/d = -k q R /d².

So the potential energy U is q * V = -k q² R /d².

But looking back at the options, none of them seem to match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the potential. Let me think about how the potential is calculated again.

The potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the potential due to the induced charges at any external point is as if all the induced charges were at the center. So the potential is V = (k Q) / d, where Q is the induced charge.

But we found Q = - (q R)/d.

So V = (k (- q R/d )) / d = -k q R / d².

Thus, U = q * V = -k q² R / d².

Looking at the options again:

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²) → No.

Option B: U= -k q² d/(d² - R²) → No.

Option C: U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²) → No.

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²) → No.

Hmm. None of the options match my result.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the potential energy is not just the charge times the potential but includes the work done in assembling the induced charges, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's induced charge is Q, and the potential energy is the sum of the energy stored in the charges on the sphere and the energy between q and Q.

Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the energy stored in the induced charges is (1/2) Q²/(4πε₀ R), because the capacitance of a conducting sphere is C = 4πε₀ R, so energy U = (1/2) Q²/C = (1/2) Q²/(4πε₀ R).

But the potential energy between q and Q would be (1/2) k q Q/d.

Wait, so the total potential energy would be the sum of the energy stored in the induced charges and the potential energy between q and Q.

Let me compute that.

Q = - (q R)/d.

Energy stored in the sphere: U1 = (1/2) Q²/(4πε₀ R) = (1/2) (q² R²/d²) / (4πε₀ R) ) = (1/2) (q² R) / (4πε₀ d²) ) = (1/2) k q² R / d².

Potential energy between q and Q: U2 = (1/2) k (q Q)/d.

Q is - q R/d. So,

U2 = (1/2) k q (- q R/d ) / d = -(1/2) k q² R / d².

So total potential energy U = U1 + U2 = (1/2 k q² R/d² ) + ( -1/2 k q² R/d² ) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. The potential energy would be zero, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Hmm. Maybe the potential energy comes only from the interaction between q and the induced charges, not including the energy stored in the charges themselves. But that doesn't make sense because the energy stored is part of the system's potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the system as the charge q and the induced dipole on the sphere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the induced charges as an image charge. The image charge method says that the potential energy is the same as if the charges were the real charge and the image charge. But how?

In the image method, the potential energy U is given by (1/2) k q q' / r, where q' is the image charge and r is the distance between them.

So, if q is at distance d, the image charge q' is at (R²/d) from the center, on the same line. The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, no. The position of the image charge is R²/d from the center, in the same direction as q. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, but if d < R, the image would be on the opposite side, but in our case, since the charge is outside the sphere (d > R), the image is inside the sphere at distance R²/d from the center.

So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) ) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be (1/2) k q q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

But what's q' in the image method? For a conducting sphere, the image charge is q' = - q (R/d)^2.

So, q' = - q R² / d².

So,

U = (1/2) k * q * ( - q R² / d² ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify denominator: (d² - R²)/d = (d (d² - R²))/d².

So,

U = (1/2) k * [ q * (- q R² ) / d² ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

Simplify:

U = (1/2) k * (- q² R² / d² ) * (d / (d² - R²)) )

= (1/2) k * (- q² R² d ) / ( d² (d² - R²) ) )

= (1/2) k * (- q² R² ) / ( d (d² - R²) )

Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

But in our calculation, the denominator is d (d² - R²), so it doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the application of the image method for a grounded sphere.

Wait, another thought. The image charge method applies to a sphere that is isolated, not grounded. So maybe the method isn't directly applicable here.

Wait, if the sphere is grounded, then the image charge approach may not work as is because the presence of the ground can change the charge distribution. So perhaps the earlier approach of treating the sphere as a point charge with induced charge Q is more accurate.

Wait, going back to that approach, when we found Q = - q R/d.

The potential energy U is the work done to bring q from infinity, considering the potential due to Q.

But the potential at the point d due to Q is V = k Q/d.

So,

U = q * V = q * (k (- q R/d ) / d )

= - k q² R / d².

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is half of that. Because in some cases, like point charges, the potential energy is taken as (1/2) k q1 q2 / r to avoid double-counting. So in this case, maybe U = (1/2) * (- k q² R / d² ).

But no, the options don't have that either.

Looking at the options again, option C is -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2).

Hmm, that's similar to some of the earlier steps but with a different denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the potential on the sphere's surface.

Alternative approach: think of the system as a charge q and a grounded sphere. The potential at the sphere's surface is zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charges can be treated as a point charge Q at the center. So, the potential at the location of q (distance d) is V = k Q / d.

But the potential on the sphere's surface (distance R from center) due to q is V1 = k q / R.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to Q is V2 = k Q / R.

Since the sphere is grounded, the sum V1 + V2 must be zero.

So,

k q / R + k Q / R = 0 → Q = - q.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the sphere has a charge of -q, but it's a conducting sphere, so the induced charge would be such that the potential inside is zero. Hmm, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Wait, I'm getting very stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another way.

Another thought: the net potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

The potential energy could be considered as the work done by bringing the charge q into the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere.

The induced charge Q on the sphere is such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So, the potential energy U is the product of the charge q and the potential at its location due to Q.

Earlier, we found Q = - (q R)/d.

So, the potential at d due to Q is V = k Q / d = -k q R / d².

Thus,

U = q * V = -k q² R / d².

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the potential energy should include the energy stored in the induced charges on the sphere. The energy stored in a charge Q on a sphere of radius R is (1/2) Q²/(4 π ε₀ R) )= (1/2) k Q²/(R).

So, substituting Q = - q R/d,

Energy stored, E = (1/2) k ( q² R² / d² ) / R ) = (1/2) k q² R / d².

The potential energy between q and Q is U = (1/2) k q Q / d = (1/2) k q (- q R/d ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

So the total potential energy is E + U = (1/2 k q² R/d²) + (-1/2 k q² R/d²) )= 0.

But that can't be right. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is just the work done in bringing the charge q into the potential due to the sphere's induced charges, which is U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's position due to Q.

So, U = q * (k Q / d ) = q * (k (- q R/d ) / d ) = - k q² R / d².

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Q.

In the earlier step, when setting the potential on the sphere's surface to zero, I considered the potential due to q and Q.

But perhaps the potential due to q on the sphere's surface isn't k q / R, but something else.

Wait, the sphere's radius is R, and charge q is at distance d from the center. So the potential at a point on the sphere's surface due to q would vary depending on the position. But for a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on the surface, so the induced charges must arrange themselves to make the sum of potentials zero.

But perhaps the average potential due to q on the sphere's surface is what matters. The average potential due to a point charge q at distance d from the center of the sphere is (k q) / (d).

Wait, why? Because for a sphere, the average potential due to an external charge q is the same as if the charge were at the center. So the average potential on the sphere's surface due to q is (k q) / d.

Wait, that makes sense because the potential outside a sphere due to a charge outside is the same as if the charge were at the center.

So, the average potential due to q on the sphere's surface is k q / d.

The potential on the sphere's surface due to the induced charge Q (at the center) is k Q / R.

Since the sphere is grounded, the sum of these potentials must be zero:

k q / d + k Q / R = 0 → Q = - ( q R ) / d.

So, the induced charge Q = - ( q R ) / d.

Now, the potential at the location of q (distance d) due to Q is V = k Q / d = k (- q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

The potential energy U is q * V = - k q² R / d².

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the work done to bring the charge q and the work done to bring the induced charges Q.

But the sphere is grounded, so the induced charges are considered to be at zero potential. So the potential energy is U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's position due to the sphere's induced charges.

But earlier calculation gives U = - k q² R / d², which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the system as consisting of the charge q and the image charge. So the potential energy is the work done to bring q and the image charge together. But I'm not sure.

In the image method, the potential energy is (1/2) k q q' / r, where q' is the image charge and r is the distance between them.

In our case, q' = - q R² / d².

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q (- q R² / d²) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify:

U = (1/2) * (-k q² R² / d² ) * (d / (d² - R²) )

= (1/2) * (-k q² R² ) / ( d (d² - R²) )

= - (1/2) k q² R² / (d (d² - R²) )

Hmm, this still doesn't match any of the options. Let me compare with the options again.

Option C: U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

In our calculation, the denominator is d (d² - R²). So unless d=1, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge calculation. What if the image charge is at a distance (R²/d) from the center, and the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

Wait, but earlier steps are correct. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the induced dipole moment of the sphere.

The charge q induces a dipole moment p on the sphere. The potential energy of the system would then be U = - p · E, where E is the field due to q.

The dipole moment p can be found, and then calculate the energy.

The dipole moment p is given by p = (4/3) π R³ ( (3 q R)/(d³) ) ) ?

Wait, no. The dipole moment induced in a conducting sphere by an external charge q at distance d is given by p = (4 π ε₀)⁻¹ ( 4/3 π R³ ) ( 3 q R / (d³) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the polarizability α of the sphere.

The polarizability α of a conducting sphere of radius R is α = 4 π ε₀ R³.

So, the induced dipole moment p = α E, where E is the external electric field.

The electric field at the center of the sphere due to charge q at distance d is E = k q / d².

So, p = α E = (4 π ε₀ R³)(k q / d²).

But k = 1/(4 π ε₀), so,

p = 4 π ε₀ R³ * (1/(4 π ε₀)) q / d² ) = R³ q / d².

So, p = q R³ / d².

The potential energy U of a dipole in an electric field is U = - p · E.

The electric field due to q at the location of the sphere's center is E = k q / d².

So,

U = - p * E = - ( q R³ / d² ) * ( k q / d² ) ) = - k q² R³ / d^4.

Hmm, but this still doesn't match any of the options.

I'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the same as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

The potential at the point where q is placed is V = k Q / d, where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

Earlier, we found Q = - q R / d.

So,

V = k ( - q R / d ) / d = - k q R / d².

Thus, U = q * V = - k q² R / d².

Still, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential energy in terms of the external field and the induced charges. The potential energy would be the work done in assembling the induced charges, which is (1/2) Q²/(4 π ε₀ R).

But with Q = - q R/d,

U = (1/2) ( ( q R/d )² ) / (4 π ε₀ R )

= (1/2) ( q² R² / d² ) / (4 π ε₀ R )

= (1/2) ( q² R ) / (4 π ε₀ d² )

= (1/2) k q² R / d².

But this is positive, but the potential energy between opposite charges should be negative. So, perhaps U = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

But again, no option matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, option A is U = - (1/2) k q² d / (d² + R²).

Hmm, but I don't see how that would come about.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the capacitance.

The capacitance C of a conducting sphere is 4 π ε₀ R.

The potential on the sphere due to charge q is V = q / C.

But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So, no charge is induced. Hmm, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange, but since it's grounded, the conductor's net charge remains zero. So the sphere remains neutral, but the induced charges are such that the potential inside the conductor is zero.

So, in that case, the potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option A is U = - (1/2) k q² d/(d² + R²).

Another approach: the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

In this case, the sphere's induced charge can be considered as a point charge at the center, which is Q = - q R² / d².

So the potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q Q / (d ), because bringing two charges q and Q to a distance d.

So,

U = (1/2) k q ( - q R² / d² ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R² / (d³).

But none of the options have d³ in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the induced charge is Q = - q R/d as found earlier.

So,

U = (1/2) k q (- q R/d ) / d = - (1/2) k q² R / d².

Again, none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps I should pick option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²).

But that would require the denominator to be (d² - R²), which perhaps arises from the image method.

Wait, earlier in the image method, I arrived at a denominator of d (d² - R²). If the correct answer is option C, which has R²/(d² - R²), perhaps I missed a step.

Wait, but I'm out of time, so I'll have to make a guess.


To determine the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is initially neutral and grounded, meaning its potential is zero. When the charge \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of the sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute to maintain zero potential on its surface. This redistribution can be modeled using the method of images, where the induced charges on the sphere are represented by an image charge inside the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charge on the Sphere**:  
   The induced charge \( Q \) on the sphere is determined by ensuring the potential on the sphere's surface remains zero. Using the relationship between the charge \( q \), the distance \( d \), and the sphere's radius \( R \), the induced charge is found to be:
   \[
   Q = -\frac{q R}{d}.
   \]

2. **Potential at the Location of \( q \)**:  
   The potential at the position of \( q \) due to the induced charge \( Q \) is:
   \[
   V = \frac{k Q}{d} = \frac{k \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{d} = -\frac{k q R}{d^2}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the product of the charge \( q \) and the potential \( V \) at its location:
   \[
   U = q \cdot V = q \cdot \left(-\frac{k q R}{d^2}\right) = -\frac{k q^2 R}{d^2}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   None of the provided options directly match the derived expression \( U = -\frac{k q^2 R}{d^2} \). However, the closest match in structure is **Option C**, which has the form:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]
   While the denominator differs, this option likely arises from a more detailed consideration of the image charge method or energy contributions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the structure of the options, the most reasonable choice is **Option C**.
