Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. So, the star's properties are given: when no spots, it's 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses, effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, right? Because dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when the spots cover part of the surface, the average Teff of the entire photosphere goes down.

The main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spot-free compared to when it has spots.

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The transition corresponds to about 1448 Angstroms. That's in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV range, I think. But maybe the exact wavelength isn't super important for this problem. What matters is the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels. Let's denote level 1 as lower energy and level 2 as higher. So, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

When the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere drops. So, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). 

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but the average Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower when spots are present.

So, the Boltzmann factor depends on temperature. When T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative because (ΔE/(k T)) increases, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So n1/n2 would decrease if T decreases, assuming ΔE is positive.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So the ratio with spots is lower than without.

Wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So, it's the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. So, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me compute that. Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (with spots). The ratio of the ratios is:

[(g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [(g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) 

The (g1/g2) cancels out, so it's exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's double-check the math. The ratio is [n1/n2]_T1 / [n1/n2]_T2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ].

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) )

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the exponent:

In the numerator, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), denominator has exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So when you divide, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, yeah, correct. So:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

But since T1 > T2 (6000 >5500), T1-T2 is positive, so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is positive. So the exponent is positive times ΔE/k.

Wait, but ΔE is E2 - E1. So if level 2 is higher than level 1, then ΔE is positive. So the exponent becomes positive, and the exp would be greater than 1. Which means the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 is greater than 1. So the ratio when no spots is higher than when with spots, which matches the given condition that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So the factor is greater than 1.

But how much is this factor? We need to calculate it. The question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes? So I need to compute exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] )

But wait, I don't actually know ΔE. Because the energy levels are specific and the transition is at 1448 Å. So, the energy difference between the two levels can be found from the wavelength of the emitted photon. Because when an atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy E = hc/λ.

So, ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-10 m.

So, let's compute ΔE.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-10 m.

So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-10) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-10 ≈ 1.373e-15 J.

But wait, 1eV is 1.602e-19 J, so to get eV:

ΔE = 1.373e-15 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 857,000 eV. That's 857 keV. That seems way too high. That can't be right because typical atomic transitions are in the range of a few eV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait! 1448 Angstroms is in the UV, but for atomic transitions, visible light is around 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Angstroms). So for a transition at 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV, the energy would be higher than visible but not extremely high.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1.448e-10 meters, correct.

So
