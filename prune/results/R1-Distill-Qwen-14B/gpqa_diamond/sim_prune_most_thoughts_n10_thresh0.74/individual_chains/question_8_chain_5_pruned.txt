Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine, specifically looking at resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some knockout experiments and are getting different resistance levels in the mutants. 

So, we have three genes: G1, G2, G3. Their knockout mutants are g1, g2, g3. Then there are double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The data on their resistance levels is given as percentages of the control (wild type). 

The results are:

- g1: 75% (so 75% as resistant as control)
- g2: 0% (no resistance)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, likely, the transcription factor is regulating the others.

Let me think about how to interpret these results. 

In genetics, if a mutation leads to a more severe phenotype than the sum of individual mutations, it suggests epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Also, if a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it could indicate that the two genes function in parallel pathways. 

Wait, but in the given data, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. Looking at the single mutants, g2 is already 0%, so when combined with another, it's still 0%. Hmm. What about g1g3, which is 10%—that's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So combining g1 and g3 leads to more severe resistance loss than either alone. 

Wait, but wait, let's think about what each mutant's resistance means. The higher the percentage, the more resistant. So if the control is 100%, a plant with 75% is less resistant. 

Looking at g2: 0% resistance. So knocking out g2 completely eliminates resistance. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor, because without it, the plant can't resist the pathogen. 

Looking at G1: g1 is at 75%, so it's less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible. G3, when knocked out, gives 50%—so a bit more susceptible than g1. 

Now, the double mutants: 

g1g2: 0%—so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as the single g2 knockout. So that suggests that G2's function is more critical here. Maybe G2 is in a pathway that's essential, and G1 is in a parallel pathway. 

g1g3: 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, leading to very low resistance. Each alone (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%) is better than 10%. So when both are out, it's worse. So perhaps G1 and G3 function in the same pathway, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. 

g2g3: 0%—so similar to the single g2. So the presence of another mutation (g3) doesn't make it worse than 0%. That suggests that G3's function is either redundant with G2's or that G3 is acting downstream of G2. Because if G3 were upstream, for example, then knocking out G2 and G3 would have the same effect as knocking out G2 alone. Alternatively, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2—so without G2, G3's function doesn't matter because the upstream gene isn't working.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor. So probably G2 is the transcription factor, because knocking out G2 leads to 0% resistance. If G2 is a transcription factor, it would regulate other genes, possibly including G1 and/or G3.

Now, in epistasis terms, which gene is epistatic to the other? If the pathway is G2 → (say) G1 → some other gene, then knocking out G2 would mask the effect of knocking out G1. Because without G2, you can't activate G1 anyway. So in that case, the double mutant g1g2 would have the same phenotype as g2. That's what we're seeing here: g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So that suggests that G1 acts downstream of G2. Because without G2, G1's function is irrelevant.

Similarly, what about g1g3? If G3 is downstream of G2, but not downstream of G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would have a worse phenotype than either. Because without G1 and G3, both pathways (if they are separate) are gone. So for example, maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3. If G1 is a transcription factor that activates another gene, and G3 is another gene downstream of G2 but not of G1, then the double mutant would lose both pathways, making the resistance even lower.

Wait, but let's think about this in terms of the double mutant g1g3. Their resistance is 10%, much lower than either single mutant. So perhaps
