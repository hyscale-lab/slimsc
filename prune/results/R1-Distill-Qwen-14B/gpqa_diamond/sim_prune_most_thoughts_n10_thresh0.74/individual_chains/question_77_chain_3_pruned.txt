Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, let me think through this carefully. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B. The first part is a reaction involving BuLi and then H+ to give product A. The second part is a Cope rearrangement under heat to give product B. I need to figure out which options correctly identify A and B.

Starting with Part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me draw its structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but let me get the structure right.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at the second position. Oh wait, wait, no. The structure for but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- as a substituent, but that's not correct. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C2. Oh wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2- group. Wait, maybe I should better draw it.

But-2-en-1-yl: the substituent is an allyl group. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No,
