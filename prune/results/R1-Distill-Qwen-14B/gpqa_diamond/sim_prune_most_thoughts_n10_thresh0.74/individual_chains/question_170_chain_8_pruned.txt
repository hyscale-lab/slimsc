Okay, so I've got this question about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). So wait, that's a two-component vector, right? I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are represented as two-component vectors because the electron has spin-1/2. So the state vector here is (3i, 4), meaning the top component is 3i and the bottom is 4.

Now, the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket product. Oh right, for an operator O, the expectation is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So in this case, the operator is S_y. But wait, what's S_y in terms of sigma matrices? I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh right, so S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the σ_y matrix given is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Which makes sense because σ matrices are 2x2 hermitian matrices. So S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would then be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ and then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write the state as a column vector. The state (3i,4) would be a vector ψ = [3i; 4]. So ψ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4.

Now, the expectation value of σ_y is ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be a row vector [ -3i, 4 ].

So let's compute ψ† σ_y. Let me calculate that. The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply ψ† (which is [ -3i, 4 ]) by σ_y...

Let's compute each element:

First element of ψ† σ_y is (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 4i.

Second element is (-3i)(-i) +4(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, i squared is -1, so 3i^2 is -3. So the second element is -3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that multiplication.

Wait, the matrix multiplication is:

ψ† (which is [a, b]) multiplied by σ_y.

So [a, b] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [ a*0 + b*i , a*(-i) + b*0 ]

So that would be [ b*i, -a*i ]

Ah, so in this case, a is -3i (since ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]) and b is 4.

So first element is 4 * i = 4i.

Second element is (-(-3i)) * i = 3i^2. Wait, wait: a is -3i, so -a is 3i. Multiply by i: 3i * i = 3i² = 3(-1) = -3. So the resulting vector after ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, we multiply this vector by ψ, which is [3i; 4]. So the expectation value is the dot product of [4i, -3] with [3i,4].

Wait, no, wait. Because σ_y is applied as ψ† σ_y ψ. So the order is ψ† multiplied by σ_y, which gives a row vector, then multiplied by ψ (the column vector).

So the total is [4
