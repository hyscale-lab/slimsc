Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and the possible partial waves allowed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state, which emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that for the final NN state, the isospin T(NN), angular momentum S(NN), and spin L(NN) must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN)=0, and we need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So in terms of the term symbol, that's (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 must mean S=0, L=0, J=0. Because (2*0+1)=1, so 1S0.

After emitting X, the NN state has T=0. So according to the condition given, T = S + L + 1 mod 2. But wait, how does that work? Oh, T is the isospin, which is a kind of angular momentum quantum number. So for the final state, maybe T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Let's compute that.

0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S + L) mod 2 = 1. So S + L must be odd. So S and L can't both be even or both be odd. So one has to be even, the other odd.

Now, the process involves the emission of a particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, which has S=0, L=0, so J=0. Then, when they emit X, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum before and after should be the same.

X is emitted, so the initial state's angular momentum is J=0. The final state is the NN plus X. So the total angular momentum J_total must still be 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN state and X must be zero. Hmm, but wait, that's not quite right. Because when you emit a particle, you're looking at the total angular momentum as the sum of the initial (which is zero, since NN is in 1S0) and the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of adding the angular momenta of the system. The initial state has J=0. After emission, the NN system has their own angular momentum (say, J_final), and the emitted X has its own angular momentum l. The conservation of angular momentum implies that the total angular momentum after emission (J_final + l) must equal the initial angular momentum, which is zero. So J_final + l = 0 → J_final = -l. But angular momentum quantum numbers are non-negative, so J_final must equal l. So J_final = l.

Wait, but J_final is the
