Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So this is similar to the 3D version where each direction (x, y, z) has a harmonic oscillator. Oh wait, wait, but wait, in 3D, the potential is actually V(x,y,z) = ½ m ω² (x² + y² + z²). So it's like three independent harmonic oscillators in each direction. 

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. The energy for a state with quantum numbers nx, ny, nz is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n + ½) ħω, so adding them gives (nx+ny+nz + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but wait, I think there's another way to look at it. Oh right, the energy is often written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers in each direction. So n = nx + ny + nz. So each state is characterized by n, which must be a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). But wait, no, each nx, ny, nz can individually be 0,1,2,... but their sum is n, which can be 0,1,2, etc.

Wait, no, the energy levels depend on the total n = nx + ny + nz. So each energy level for a given n is (n + 3/2) ħω. But how do the states fill up? For each n, the number of possible states is (n+1)(n+2)/2, or something like that. Wait no, maybe it's the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, which is (n+2 choose 2) or (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for each n, the degeneracy (number of states) is (n+1)(n+2)/2? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, for 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. The number of distinct eigenstates for a given n is the number of ways that n = n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer. So the degeneracy is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So yes, the degeneracy for each n is (n+1)(n+2)/2? No, wait, no, wait. Let me compute for n=0. Then n_x = n_y = n_z =0. So only one state. Plugging into (0+2)(0+1)/2: (2)(1)/2=1. Correct. For n=1: possible states are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states. Plugging into (1+2)(1+1)/2 = 3*2/2=3. Correct. For n=2: the possible triplets are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So six states. Plugging into (2+2)(2+1)/2=4*3/2=6. Correct. So yes, the formula (n+2)(n+1)/2 gives the degeneracy.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have confused the formula. Because the number of ways to choose non-negative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = n is (n + 2) choose 2, which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, but wait, wait. Let's clarify: in quantum systems, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is n
