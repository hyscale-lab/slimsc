Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an annihilation process: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I remember that annihilation typically involves converting matter and antimatter into energy, but in this case, it's producing other particles. So probably, this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. That probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the proton must be at rest, right? Because in the center-of-momentum frame, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the initial frame is the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the proton is at rest.

Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving at some slow speed. So the initial momentum would be the momentum of the antiproton, which is low because it's moving slowly.

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A+ and two A-. So, assuming that the particles are produced in pairs, perhaps in their rest frames or moving. But I'm not sure. But since the problem is about the velocity of A, perhaps each A has the same velocity, or maybe I need to figure that out.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum. Let's model this.

First, the initial particles: proton (p) and antiproton (p̄). Proton has charge +e, antiproton has charge -e. So their rest masses are the same. The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy.

What's the rest mass energy of proton
