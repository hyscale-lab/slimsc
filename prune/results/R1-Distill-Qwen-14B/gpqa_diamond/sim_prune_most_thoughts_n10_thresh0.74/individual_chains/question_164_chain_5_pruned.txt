Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and the periods between primary eclipses are 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Wait, but in binary systems, the eclipse period is the same as the orbital period, right? Because the stars orbit each other, so when one passes in front of the other from our point of view, that's an eclipse. So the time between consecutive primary eclipses should be the orbital period.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass considered is the sum of both stars in each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shifts of the stars as they orbit the common center of mass. The amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the mass of the other star. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's orbiting around a point closer to itself.

Wait, but how do I relate the velocities to the masses? There's a formula I think. The mass function comes into play here, but maybe I don't need to get that complicated. Let me think about the mass ratio first.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star has a smaller orbit. So the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. Because velocity is distance over time, and the distance each star moves is proportional to their mass ratio.

Wait, right. The mass ratio q is m2/m1. But wait, in the system, the stars might be labeled differently. Let me think again. The velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2 for the two stars. The mass ratio q is (M2/M1) = (K1)/(K2). Because the more massive star has a lower velocity amplitude.

So for system_1, K1 is 10 km/s and K2 is 5 km/s. So the mass ratio q1 is (5/10) =
