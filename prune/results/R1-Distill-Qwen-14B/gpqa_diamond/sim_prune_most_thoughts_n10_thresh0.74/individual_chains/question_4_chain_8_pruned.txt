Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. Let me read it again. The question is about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So, in our universe, magnets always have both poles—you can't have just a single pole. But in this other universe, that's not the case. The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would be different because of that change.

Hmm, Maxwell's equations. I remember there are four of them. Let me recall each one. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field. I think it relates to Gauss's law for electricity. Something like div E equals rho over epsilon zero. That's about electric charge distribution. Wait, but the question is about magnets, so maybe that's not the one that changes.

The second equation is about the curl of the electric field. Oh right, Faraday's law. It says that the curl of E is the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. So that's about induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields. I don't think this one would change because it's more about how changing B fields create E fields, not about the existence of monopoles.

The third equation is about the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh wait, in our world, the divergence of B is zero. So div B = 0. That comes from the fact that there are no magnetic monopoles. So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. So this equation must change. So the third equation would be different.

The fourth equation is about the curl of the magnetic field. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition. It says curl H equals the time derivative of E plus the current density. Wait, or is it the other way around? I think it's curl B = μ0 (J + ε0 dE/dt). Oh right, that's the equation. So that equation is about how magnetic fields are generated by currents and changing electric fields. But if monopoles exist, would this equation change? I'm not too sure.

Wait, in the case of magnetic monopoles, there's another term. I remember that when magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations get an extra term. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Also, another equation gets modified. Let me think. I think the curl of E would also get a term related to the magnetic current or something
