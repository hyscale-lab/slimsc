Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The question gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. 

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's [Si/Star_2] divided by [Si/Star_1] or something like that? Wait, no, the ratio is the silicon in each star's photosphere compared to each other. So it would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2) where n_Si1 is the number density of silicon in Star_1 and n_Si2 is that in Star_2.

Wait, no, the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's [Si in Star_1]/[Si in Star_2]. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me think. No, the question asks for the ratio of the silicon in Star_1 to that in Star_2. So n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Alright, let's break down the given data.

First, I need to find the abundance of silicon in each star relative to hydrogen, perhaps, and then find the ratio between the two.

Wait, but how? Let's see. The Sun's photosphere has [Fe/H] given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH =
