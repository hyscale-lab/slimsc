Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, giving 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), producing 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the options are A, B, C, D, each provides what A and B are. I need to figure out what reagents A and B are in each case.

First, let's tackle the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, let's write that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, what happens? I remember that the reaction of ketones with sodium cyanide can lead to the formation of cyanohydrins. Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation reaction. So, the ketone reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. But what reagent is needed for that?

I think that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo this addition. The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. So, H3O+ (which is option A) or maybe something else. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with H2SO4, but H3O+ is a possible acid.

Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with CN- in acidic conditions would form the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A should be an acid, like H3O+ or something else. Looking at the options: options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- (bisulfite). H3O+ is just acid.

So, for the first reaction, the reagent A is the acid. So, either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as the acid.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes in the cyanohydrin formation, the acid is needed to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. So, reagent A must be an acid. So, A is either H3O+ or perhaps another acid.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So, the first reaction's reagent A is an acid, so the options are either A, B, C, or D. Wait, but the products of these first reactions are nitriles with hydroxyl groups.

Wait, another thought: could it be a hydrolysis reaction? No
