Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, but maybe I don't need to focus too much on the Lagrangian details right now. The question is about the possible decay modes of the boson X.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. I remember that when a particle decays, the mass has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into. So, for example, if X is decaying into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but what fermions are we talking about here? The Lagrangian term involves ψ_f, which I think is a fermion field. The interaction term probably tells me what fermions X can couple to. Looking at the Lagrangian: it's something like λf times something involving ψ_f. So X couples to fermions f.

But what's λf? Oh, maybe λ is a coupling constant, and f is the type of fermion. So the interaction is with fermions f. So X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle as long as the mass allows it.

So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions. Let me list all the possible fermions and their masses. I need to remember the masses of the quarks and leptons.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Their masses are roughly (in GeV/c²):

u: about 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
d: about 4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
s: around 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
c: about 1.25 GeV
b: around 4.5 GeV
t: way heavier, like 173 GeV.

Leptons: electron (e), muon (μ), tau (τ), and their neutrinos. The charged leptons' masses:

e: ~0.000511 GeV
μ: ~0.1057 GeV
τ: ~1.777 GeV.

So, the decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. But for each pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to X's mass, which is 6 GeV.

Let me go through the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
So for each decay:

- b and bbar: each ~4.5 GeV. So 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So this decay can't happen. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Check each:

c cbar: c is ~1.25 GeV each. 2*1.25=2.5 <=6. So allowed.

s sbar: 2*0.095=0.19 GeV, allowed.

u ubar: ~0.0044 GeV, allowed.

d dbar: same as u, allowed.

tau+ tau-: 2*1.777=3.554 GeV, allowed.

mu+ mu-: 2*0.1057=0.2114, allowed.

e+ e-: 2*0.000511≈0.001, allowed.

So all these decay channels are possible. But what about the other fermions, like the top quark? Top is way too heavy. X can't decay into t tbar because 2*173 GeV is way more than 6 GeV. So option B doesn't include top, which is fine.

Option C: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, t tbar would require 2*173 GeV, which is 346 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so that's impossible. So option C includes a decay that's not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, the b quark: 4.5 GeV each. So 9 GeV total. X is 6, so can't decay into b bbar. So option D is wrong because it includes b.

So looking at the options, only option B is possible. Because in option B, the heaviest decay product is c cbar, which is 2.5 GeV, well within 6 GeV.

Wait, but what about the tau? 1.777 * 2 = 3.554 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. That's allowed.

So the possible decays are all the ones in option B: c, s, u, d quarks, tau, mu, and e.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a decay to be possible, the total mass of the decay products must not exceed the mass of \( X \). The interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \), and the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs.

The masses of the relevant fermions are approximately:

- Quarks: \( u \sim 0.0022 \, \text{GeV}, \, d \sim 0.0047 \, \text{GeV}, \, s \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV}, \, c \sim 1.25 \, \text{GeV}, \, b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV}, \, t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \),
- Leptons: \( e \sim 0.000511 \, \text{GeV}, \, \mu \sim 0.1057 \, \text{GeV}, \, \tau \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \).

For each decay channel, the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair must be less than or equal to 6 GeV:

1. **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), where the total mass is \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds 6 GeV. This decay is not allowed, so Option A is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\!e^- \). The total masses for these decay products are:
   - \( c\bar{c}: 2 \times 1.25 = 2.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( s\bar{s}: 2 \times 0.095 = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( u\bar{u}: 2 \times 0.0022 = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( d\bar{d}: 2 \times 0.0047 = 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( \tau^+\tau^-: 2 \times 1.777 = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( \mu^+\mu^-: 2 \times 0.1057 = 0.2114 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( e^+\!e^-: 2 \times 0.000511 = 0.001022 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   All these decay channels are allowed since their total masses are less than or equal to 6 GeV. Option B is correct.

3. **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), where the total mass is \( 2 \times 173 = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which far exceeds 6 GeV. This decay is not allowed, so Option C is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), where the total mass is \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds 6 GeV. This decay is not allowed, so Option D is incorrect.

Thus, the only kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are those listed in Option B.

Answer: B
