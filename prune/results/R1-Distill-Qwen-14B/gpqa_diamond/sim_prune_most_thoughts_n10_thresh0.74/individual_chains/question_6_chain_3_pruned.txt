Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, r and θ. The potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, can this be rewritten in a way that makes the problem easier? Maybe factor something out.

Let me see. V(r,θ) can be written as (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh wait, because 1/2 + 3/2 = 2 when cos²θ is 1, but wait, no, 1/2 kr² is multiplied by (1 + 3 cos²θ). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about splitting the potential into two parts: a radial part and an angular part.

Wait, let me write the potential as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, perhaps I can factor out r². So it becomes V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Or, maybe better to factor out (1/2)kr², so V = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

But wait, the form of the potential looks a bit familiar. I think this is similar to a potential that can be solved using the method of separation of variables in polar coordinates. Oh, right, because in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of r and θ, which might separate the equation into radial and angular parts.

So, the Hamiltonian H is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential. Let's write it out in polar coordinates. The kinetic energy in 2D polar coordinates is (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r²) d/dr (r dψ/dr
