Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a series of seven reactions.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring is substituted with two groups: a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Additionally, there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, and the ketone is at position 1, but wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering matters. Let me think: the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5? No, wait, wait. Let's clarify. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is on ethan-1-one, which means the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone is attached directly to the benzene at position 1 (I think that's correct). Alternatively, the ketone is on the ethyl group attached to benzene. Wait, wait, no. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, so the structure would be benzene attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a methyl group. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene ring, and the ketone is at position 1? But wait, benzene is a ring, so when you have three substituents, the numbering should be
