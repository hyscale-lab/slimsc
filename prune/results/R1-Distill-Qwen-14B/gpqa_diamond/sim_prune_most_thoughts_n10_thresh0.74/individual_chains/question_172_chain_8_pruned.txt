Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more excited the atoms are, right? So if star 1 has more excited atoms, it must be hotter than star 2. So T1 is greater than T2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting. So delta E is k*T for some T?

Wait, wait. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution. The population of energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, E2 is higher than E1, so the ratio should be something involving exponential of negative delta E over kT.

In this problem, the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2. Let me define the excitation as the number of atoms in the higher level. So for star 1, the number is n1, and for star 2, it's n2. And n1 = 2 n2.

Assuming that the energy levels are the same for both stars, because they're talking about the same energy difference. Oh wait, the question says the energy difference is determined to be approximately 1.38
