Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how stable the complex is. A large K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. I think the formula for the Ca-EDTA complex is CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. So the complex is CaEDTA^2-.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in this solution. Because EDTA is a chelating agent, the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates to a certain extent, releasing some Ca^2+ ions.

I remember the formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in different protonated forms. Oh wait, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so maybe we can assume that the EDTA is mostly in the Y^4- form? Or perhaps it's already accounted for in the K value.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Let’s set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model the dissociation.

Initially:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = 0
[EDTA^4-] = 0

Change:
When some dissociation happens, let's say x is the amount that dissociates. So:

[CaEDTA^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x should be very small compared to 0.02)
[Ca^2+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x

At equilibrium, the concentrations are approximately:
[CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So plugging into the K expression:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) 

Which simplifies to:
5e10 = 0.02 / (x²)

Solving for x²:
x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so x² = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 0.02 is 2 * 10^-2.

So K = 5e10 = (2e-2) / (x^2)

So, x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → which is 4e-13.

So x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 * 2 is 13.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Let me think: 1e-6 is 1e-6, (1e-6)^2 is 1e-12. So 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Hmm, but 6.5 is 13/2. So the square root is 1e-6.5 which is the same as 3.16e-7 approximately.

So sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (3.16e-7) ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, 1e-13 is 1e-12 * 0.1, so the square root is 1e-6 * sqrt(0.1). Because sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. So yes, 1e-6 * 0.316 is about 3.16e-7.

So x is 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7.

So [Ca^2+] is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, which matches this.

Wait, let me double-check the math.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7.

So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which matches option C.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions dissociated at equilibrium. Initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, the concentrations are approximately:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
