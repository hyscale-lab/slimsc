Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of the temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Both are detected using transit and RV methods around a star. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Each planet's mass and radius are given. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Oh, and both have same albedo, so that won't affect the calculation.

The transit method would tell us their sizes, because the dip in brightness depends on their radius. Radial velocity method gives their masses. But the question is about equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula. I remember it's something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Oh, and because both planets have same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures depends on the square root of (R_star/(a1)) and (R_star/(a2)), but wait, no, let me get the formula right.

The formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming no greenhouse effect, and they're blackbodies) is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 ). Since both have same albedo, the (1 - albedo) terms will be the same for both, so when taking the ratio, that part cancels.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because the R_star and 2 in the denominator cancel out.

Wait, let me think. T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). So for each planet, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/a). So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because (sqrt(R/a1) ) / (sqrt(R/a2) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets. How?

Well, the RV method gives the mass of the planet and the velocity amplitude of the star. The RV shift is related to the Doppler effect. The star's velocity is maximum when the planet is at a particular point in its orbit. The amplitude of the shift depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and distance.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(2/3) )) ) ... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should use the fact that the RV shift is inversely proportional to the planet's distance from the star for a given period and mass.

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/(1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) / ( ( (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )^(1/3) ) * (2π) ) )

But maybe an easier approach is to think about the Doppler shift formula. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The maximum Doppler shift (semi-amplitude K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/ (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/( (2π G )^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But that's getting complicated. Maybe alternatively, since the planets are causing periodic shifts in the star's velocity, their semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps the main point is that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital distance a for a given period and mass. Because Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) a³. So if M_p is much less than M_star, which it is here (since the star is 1.5 solar masses, and the planets are only 7 and 5 Earth masses), then M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) a³. So a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4 π²).

But the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Again, since M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But without knowing the inclination angle i, it's tricky. However, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo, but perhaps sin i is the same for both, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the RV method gives the minimum mass, but the question states that the planets are detected using RV, so maybe sin i is known, but I don't think we have enough information. So perhaps there's another approach.

Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shift caused by each planet on the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Maybe the RV semi-amplitude is given by these shifts. Because the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to the velocity (v) by Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light.

So if the star's velocity is maximum K, then Δλ = K * λ / c.

Given Δλ for the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å (which is 630 nm), the maximum shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c. Wait, no, more accurately, Δλ/λ = v/c, so v = c*(Δλ/λ).

Wait, the formula is v = c * (Δλ / λ). So for Planet1, the RV semi-amplitude K1 is:

K1 = c * (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) ) = c * (0.03/6300) m/s.

Similarly for K2, it's 0.04/6300 times c.

So K1 = c * (0.03 / 6300 )

K2 = c * (0.04 / 6300 )

So K2 = (4/3) K1.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass and orbital distance. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/ (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/( (2π)^(1/3) )) * ( ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) )

But since e is zero (the orbits are circular), the formula simplifies because (1 - e²) becomes 1.

So K = ( ( G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( 2π ) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. From Kepler's third law, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by:

P² = (4π² a³)/(G (M_star + M_p) )

Assuming M_p << M_star, this becomes:

P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_star )

Which can be rearranged to a³ = (G M_star P²)/(4 π² )

But how do I relate this to K? Let's see. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G M_p )^(1) ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( (2π) / (P c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me look up the exact formula for K. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/(1 - e^2)^(1/2)) ) * ( ( (2π G) / (c^3 P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

K = ( (2π G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P c) )^(1/3)

But given that e=0, and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

But perhaps I can find a relation between K and a. Since K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3)) )*(1/P^(1/3)).

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4π² a³)/(G M_star )

So P = (4 π² a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )

Putting this into the K equation:

K ∝ (M_p) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

= M_p * ( (4 π² a³/(G M_star )) )^(-1/6 )

= M_p * ( (a^3 ) )^(-1/6 ) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 )

= M_p * a^(-1/2) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 )

But this seems complicated. Maybe alternative approach: K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) * (1 / a^(1/2) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of K. Given that K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2) ) * (1 / M_star^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take the ratio of K1 and K2.

K1 / K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

From the formula:

K is proportional to ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But assuming M_p << M_star, K ≈ ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3 )

Now, from Kepler's law:

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G M_star )

So P = (4 π² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So 1/P = ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / ( (4 π² a³ )^(1/2 ) )

So 1/P^(1/3) = ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/6 ) a^(1/2) )

Putting this back into K:

K ≈ M_p / M_star^(2/3) * ( G M_star )^(1/6 ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/6 ) a^(1/2) )

Simplify:

M_p / M_star^(2/3) * ( M_star^(1/6 ) ) = M_p / M_star^( (4/6 -1/6 ) ) = M_p / M_star^(1/2 )

So K ≈ M_p / ( M_star^(1/2) a^(1/2) )

So K is proportional to M_p / (sqrt( M_star a ) )

So K = constant * ( M_p ) / sqrt( M_star a )

Thus, K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because K1 = constant * M1/(sqrt(M_star a1) )

and K2 = constant * M2/(sqrt(M_star a2) )

Taking the ratio:

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts.

So K1 = 0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m * c

Similarly, K2 = 0.04e-10 m / 6300e-10 m * c

So K1/K2 = (0.03 / 0.04 ) = 3/4.

So 3/4 = (M1/M2) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses.

So M1/M2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = (3/4) / (7/5 ) ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 0.5357 → a2 /a1 = (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287 → a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

But wait, I think I messed up the ratio. Because K1/K2 = 3/4, and M1 is 7, M2 is 5. So 3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) → exactly (15)/(28)≈0.5357.

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 ≈ 0.287.

So a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

But I need to find the ratio a1/a2. Wait, because a2 = 0.287 a1 → a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2. So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Wait, but wait, let's calculate that more accurately.

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

→ sqrt( a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = (15)/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = (225)/(784) ≈ 0.287.

So a1 = a2 / 0.287 ≈ 3.48 a2.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio a1/a2. From a2 = 0.287 a1 → a1 = a2 / 0.287 → a1/a2 = 1/0.287 ≈ 3.48.

So a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Now, recall that the equilibrium temperature ratio is sqrt( a2 /a1 ), as per the earlier formula.

Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt( Rstar / a )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (Rstar/(a1)) ) / sqrt( Rstar/(a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait no, let me recheck.

Equilibrium temperature T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^{1/4 }

So T1 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a1) )

T2 = T_star * sqrt( R/(2 a2) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a1 ), which we found a2/a1 ≈ 0.287, so sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, that's about 0.536, which is approximately 0.54. But looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Because maybe I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, in the ratio K1/K2 = 3/4, we have:

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) → (15/28) → 15/28 is approximately 0.5357.

So a2/a1 = (15/28)^2 = 225/784 ≈ 0.287.

So a1/a2 = 1/0.287 ≈ 3.48.

So a1 = 3.48 a2.

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/3.48) → sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So the ratio is about 0.536, which is approximately 0.54. The options given are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

So option C is ~0.53, which matches our calculation.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Here, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the orbital distances of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

From the problem, the RV shifts for Planet1 and Planet2 are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å, respectively. This gives the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

The RV semi-amplitude is also proportional to \(\frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}\), so:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7\) Earth masses and \(M_2 = 5\) Earth masses:

\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{15}{28}\right)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This value is closest to the option \(0.53\). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately:
