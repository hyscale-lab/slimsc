Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is about a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. And we're supposed to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials that depend on r and θ can sometimes be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But wait, this potential has both r² terms and a cos²θ term. So maybe I should think about this in polar coordinates since it's two-dimensional.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, that's the same as (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ], right? Because 1/2 + 3/2 is 2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, but that's not exactly right here. Let's see: the first term is (1/2)kr², and the second is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So factor out kr²: V = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about this as a sum of two parts. The first part is like a harmonic oscillator in r, and the second part depends on θ. Wait, but in two dimensions, the harmonic oscillator potential is usually (1/2) m ω² r². But here the potential is (1/2) kr² plus another term. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular momentum operators or something. Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be expressed in terms of a radial part and an angular part that's a function of cos²θ.

Wait, cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle formula: cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So V would become (1/2) k r² [1 + (1
