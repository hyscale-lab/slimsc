Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). I need to figure out which 1H NMR data is correct among the options A to D.

First, let me break down the structure. A di-substituted benzene ring means there are two substituents on the benzene. The total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents contribute 2 more carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents can have more than one carbon each. Wait, the total is 8 carbons including the benzene. So benzene is 6, substituents make up 2 carbons. Or perhaps substituents plus any other groups.

Wait, carbonyl group is present. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Also, the aromatic-halogen bond suggests another substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

Wait, but in the FTIR, peaks for both carbonyl (C=O) and Ar-X. So the structure has a carbonyl group attached to the aromatic ring and a halogen attached as another substituent.

So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, but wait, a carbonyl group is usually part of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So on the benzene ring, if one substituent is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a carbonyl connected to another substituent.

Wait, but wait, how many carbons does the substituent take? Let's see. The total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Because 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8. But, wait, substituents can be more complex.

Wait,
