Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me read through the problem again and try to piece it together.

Alright, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak one. Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I need to identify what each of these compounds A, B, C, D, etc., might be. Since the reactions involve equivalents and the products are specific, perhaps they're elements or common compounds.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. The product C is bright red. I remember that some elements form red compounds. For example, copper can form copper(II) ions which are blue, but maybe in another oxidation state? Wait, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something else. Oh wait, another thought—could A be sulfur? Because when sulfur is burned, it forms SO2 or SO3, but that's not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium or another alkali metal. But then B would have to be something that reacts in a 8 equivalents ratio. Alternatively, think about the reaction of an element with another to form a compound. For example, perhaps A is iron and B is sulfur. But what's the product C then?

Wait, the product C reacts with gas D to produce E. And E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like chlorine gas or maybe a highly toxic compound like sarin or something. Wait, but perhaps E is something like phosgene?

Alternatively, thinking about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If D is a gas, maybe it's a halogen. Wait, but earlier, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like water, alcohol, maybe something else. Wait, D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, which is a solvent. So maybe H is something like HCl, but that's not a solvent. Wait, no. If B is O2, for example
