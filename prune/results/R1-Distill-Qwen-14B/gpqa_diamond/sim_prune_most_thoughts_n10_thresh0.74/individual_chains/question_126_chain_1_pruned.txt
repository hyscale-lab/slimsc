Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

I remember that LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. Also, the molecule has an S configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3 and a methoxy group at C5. So the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3CH3, but with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But in this case, the substituent is on C5, so it's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe better to number the carbons:

1 2 3 4 5 6

So, position 3 is the ketone (CO), position 5 has the methoxy (OCH3). So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, hexane has six carbons. So
