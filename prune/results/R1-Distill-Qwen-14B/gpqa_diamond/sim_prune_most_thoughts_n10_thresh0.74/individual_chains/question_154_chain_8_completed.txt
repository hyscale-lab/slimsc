Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, let's look at the data provided. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest and corresponds to M+, so the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The m/z 158 suggests maybe a fragment or an isotope, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's a solid and the other options don't mention amines, I'm thinking maybe an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That peak is around the range for carbonyl groups (C=O). Carboxylic acids typically show a strong peak around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an ester or something else with a carbonyl.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid - the -OH proton in a carboxylic acid typically appears around 10-12 ppm, but as a broad peak. Wait, the NMR here shows it as a singlet. Carboxylic acids usually have broad signals due to exchange with water, but maybe in this case, it's a sharp peak if it's deuterated or under certain conditions. Alternatively, another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but 11 ppm is a bit high, though not impossible.

Then there are two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm, each integrating for 2H. Those are in the aromatic region. The splitting into doublets suggests maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. Let me think: if you have two doublets, each integrating for 2H, that often suggests a para-substituted benzene. Like, for example, a para-substituted ring where each pair of protons is equivalent. So maybe two substituents in the para positions, or one substituent that's at one position causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Now, looking at the options to see which fit:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl and a chlorine. Structure would be Cl in position 3, OH in position 2, and aldehyde in position 1 (assuming benzene numbering). So, the aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 5, I think? Or maybe positions 5 and 6. Wait, benzaldehyde is position 1, so the substituents would be on 2 and 3. So the protons on the ring would be at positions 4,5,6. But wait, benzaldehyde has the aldehyde group in position 1, then the next positions are 2,3,4,5,6 around the ring. If there's a Cl in 3 and OH in 2, then the protons in 4 and 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to OH? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the protons would split into different patterns. Also, the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which would suggest two sets of equivalent protons. If there are substituents in ortho and para positions, maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in position 4 of a benzoic acid. So the carboxylic acid is in position 1, Cl in position 4. The ring protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, position 2 and 6 would be equivalent (para to each other?), and position 3 and 5 would be another pair. So in the NMR, perhaps each pair would be a doublet. Let me think: the protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, maybe appearing around 8 ppm, and the meta protons (3 and 5) would be a bit upfield. But wait, the NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. So maybe the protons next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded more, but I'm not sure. Also, the 11 ppm peak in NMR would be the carboxylic acid -OH proton. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which is a bit odd because usually, the -OH in benzoic acid is broad, not sharp. Hmm, but maybe it's in D2O or some other condition, but I'm not certain. Also, the molecular weight: benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which is 122 g/mol. But our molecular ion is 156. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl as well. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: Cl is about 35.5, so C7 (7*12=84) + H5 (5) + Cl (35.5) + O2 (32) = 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight would be approx 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, which is close. Also, the M+ is 156, which would match. So that's possible.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, chloroformate would be OCOCl, but phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula would be C6H5ClO2CO? Wait, no: phenyl is C6H5, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as option B. Let me calculate molecular weight: same as B. So the molecular weight is 156.5 as well. But in option C, the functional groups would be an ester. The IR would show a carbonyl, but where? In chloroformate, the carbonyl would be from the CO group. The ester carbonyl is usually around 1720-1750 cm^-1, which matches the IR data. But what about the NMR? The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which could be the aldehyde, but wait, chloroformate doesn't have an aldehyde group. Alternatively, could it be an O-H stretch? No, because chloroformate is an ester, so it's OCOCl. Unless it's something else.

Wait, let me think again. The singlet at 11 ppm in the NMR. If it's a carbonyl oxygen or something else, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton, but chloroformate doesn't have that. Wait, no, in chloroformate, the structure is O=C(OCl)Ph. Wait, no, the structure is ClCO-O-Ph. So the carbonyl is in the middle. So the protons on the aromatic ring would be similar to benzene with an ester group. So the NMR would show aromatic protons. The singlet at 11 ppm doesn't fit with that, unless it's an aldehyde, which it isn't. So maybe option C is less likely.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in position 2 of benzoic acid (position 1 is COOH). So the ring protons would be positions 3,4,5,6. The H in position 3 would be ortho to Cl, position 4 meta, etc. But I'm not sure about the splitting. The NMR shows two doublets. If the substituents are in positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), then the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. The protons in positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (since Cl is in 2), and 4 and 6 would be another pair. So maybe positions 3 and 5 would be as a doublet, and 4 and 6 as another. But I'm not sure about the exact shifts. Also, the molecular weight: same as option B and C, since it's C7H5ClO2 again. So 156.5.

Now, let's go back to the NMR. The 1H NMR shows 11 ppm (singlet, 1H). If that's a carboxylic acid -OH, then in the NMR, it's a broad peak. But the data says it's a singlet, which is sharp. So maybe it's not the OH? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde. Wait, but 11 ppm is high for an aldehyde, but maybe possible in certain cases. Let me think about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would have a benzaldehyde group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group (OH) and Cl. So the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm, but the problem says 11.0 ppm. Hmmm. Maybe in some cases, like if it's de-shielded more due to substituents, it could be higher. So the aldehyde proton at 11 ppm would fit. Then the hydroxyl group would be at around 5 ppm or so, but wait, that's not in the given data. Alternatively, the OH could be exchanging and not showing up as a peak, but the data shows a peak at 11 ppm which is a singlet. So maybe it's not the OH. Alternatively, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, let's think about the IR again. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually a bit lower, around 1700. But sometimes it can be higher. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is higher, around 1720-1750. So maybe the compound is an ester. Which would match option C, phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. But then the 11 ppm peak wouldn't fit, unless it's something else. Alternatively, the peak at 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton in option A.

Wait, but in option A, the structure is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So that would have an aldehyde group, which would give a singlet at around 9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows 11 ppm. Maybe the substituents are causing the aldehyde to be more deshielded. Alternatively, could the peak at 11 ppm be an acidic proton like the -OH in the hydroxy group? But in that case, it would be broad, not a singlet. So that's conflicting.

Let me think about option B again. 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm^-1. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700. So maybe the peak is a bit higher, indicating perhaps some electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) which would increase the carbonyl frequency. So that's possible. The NMR would have the aromatic protons, and the -OH as a singlet around 11 ppm. But wait, in benzoic acid, the -OH is usually broad, but sometimes in the NMR, if it's a solid, maybe it's a sharp peak. Alternatively, maybe the sample was treated in a way that the -OH is deprotonated, but that would give a different signal. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's look at the molecular ion. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is 156.5, which matches the m/z 156. The other peak at m/z 158 is 32%. That's 2 m/z units higher than 156. How does that make sense? Chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35, so maybe the molecular ion plus something? Or perhaps it's an isotope peak. Wait, Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope, and about 25% for 37Cl. So if the molecular ion is at 156 (35Cl), then the next peak would be at 156 + 2 = 158 (37Cl). The abundance would be about 25%, which aligns with the data. So the m/z 158 is the M+ with 37Cl, which explains the 32% abundance. So that fits, considering natural Cl isotopes.

Now, the NMR for 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the aromatic protons. Since the substituents are in positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), the ring has two substituents in para positions. So the protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. The protons in positions 3 and 5 are meta to Cl and ortho to COOH. So their chemical shifts would differ. The protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. Let's think about their shifts.

In benzoic acid, the protons next to the COOH group (ortho and para) are deshielded. For example, in benzoic acid, the ortho protons are around 7.5-8.0 ppm, and the meta protons around 7.1-7.3 ppm. But with a Cl in the para position, the deshielding effect could be stronger. Let me think about the substitution pattern. The Cl in position 4 would cause the ortho protons (positions 3 and 5) to be more deshielded, perhaps around 8.0 ppm. Wait, but in option B, the substituents are in 1 and 4. So positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so their protons would be more deshielded, appearing upfield or downfield? Wait, Cl is an electronegative group, so it deactivates the ring. So, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing downfield. The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, appearing upfield.

So in the NMR, the downfield protons would be around 8 ppm, and the upfield ones around 7.7 ppm. That's exactly what the data shows: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits. Also, the 11 ppm peak would be the -OH proton of the carboxylic acid. But earlier I thought that might not fit because it's a singlet, but perhaps if the sample was prepared in a way that the -OH is sharp, or it's just the way the data is presented.

Wait, another thought: could the 11 ppm peak be an aldehyde? Because option A is a benzaldehyde. But the problem is that the molecular ion for option A would be different. Let's calculate the molecular weight. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as options B and C. So molecular weight is same. So the molecular ion for option A is also 156.5. So the m/z data matches.

But looking at the NMR, if it's an aldehyde (CHO), the proton would appear as a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But the given data shows 11.0 ppm. That's a bit high. Maybe the substituents are causing it to be more deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is due to an acidic proton elsewhere.

Putting this together, let's compare the options.

Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) fits the IR (carbonyl at 1720), the molecular ion and the isotope peak. The NMR aromatic protons match the data, with two doublets. The 11 ppm peak could be the -OH (but I'm a bit confused about the sharpness), but maybe in this case, it's considered.

Option A: The aldehyde proton would be around 10 ppm, but the data is at 11, which is a bit higher. Also, the IR would show an aldehyde carbonyl. Wait, aldehydes have a carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1 as well. So the IR data could fit either a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. But the aldehyde's proton is at a higher ppm, which may not fit.

Wait, the IR also shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's O-H stretch. So that would support either a carboxylic acid (which has an -OH) or perhaps an alcohol. But none of the options except A and B have an -OH group. Option C is an ester, no -OH. So maybe the O-H is from the carboxylic acid (option B) or from the hydroxy group in option A.

So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a broad O-H peak, which it does. The 1H NMR would have the -OH as a singlet, but I thought that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe in a solid, the -OH doesn't exchange as much, leading to a sharp peak. I'm not entirely sure.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have Cl in position 2 and COOH in position 1. The NMR would show aromatic protons in a different pattern. Let me think: positions 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, and positions 4 and 5 would be meta. But I'm not sure about their splitting. The NMR data shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which would fit para-substituted rings as in option B. So perhaps option D has a different splitting pattern.

So putting everything together, the molecular weight fits options B, C, and A. But the NMR seems to fit B better, as the aromatic protons would be two doublets due to para substitution. The IR's O-H and carbonyl fit B as well. The 11 ppm peak is a bit confusing, but perhaps it's the -OH in the acid.

Wait, another point: the molecular ion is at 156, which corresponds to the molecular formula C7H5ClO2. Let's look at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. Yes.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate is also C7H5ClO2. So both B and C have the same molecular formula and molecular weight.

But the IR data: option C would have an ester carbonyl (which is around 1720), which matches the IR. But for option C, the structure is O=C(OCl)Ph. So the phenyl group is attached via an ester oxygen. Now, what about the NMR for option C?

Phenyl chloroformate would have the aromatic protons similar to other esters. The substituent is ClCO-O- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is in a meta position. Wait, no, it's para because it's a single substituent. So the aromatic protons would be in positions ortho and para to the substituent. But in that case, the NMR would show a different splitting pattern. Let's think: the substituent is ClCO-O- attached to benzene. So the ring would have an ester group in position 1, so the protons in positions 2,3,4,5,6 would be split into two sets: ortho (2 and 6) and meta (3 and 5), with the para (4) being equivalent. Wait, no, that's not right. If the substituent is in position 1, then the ring is symmetric. So the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets: one for 2 and 6, and another for 3 and 5. So that would fit the given data. But what about the 11 ppm peak? Phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an -OH or an aldehyde group, so the 11 ppm peak would have to be something else, perhaps an aliphatic proton, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: maybe the NMR peak at 11 ppm is due to the aldehyde proton in option A. But earlier I thought that's a bit high. Let me think: the aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, but in some cases, like when electron-withdrawing groups are present, it can shift up. So 11 ppm is possible. Then the aromatic protons in option A would be in positions 4 and 5, perhaps as doublets. Let me think about the structure: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6.

Wait, that's three protons. But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that some protons are equivalent. Maybe the protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 5 are another set. But that would give three different sets, but the NMR shows two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are causing two pairs of equivalent protons. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me summarize the possibilities.

Option B:

- IR: O-H (broad) and C=O (1720)
- NMR: two doublets for aromatic protons (8.02 and 7.72 ppm)
- M/Z: 156 (M+) and 158 (Cl isotope)
- 11 ppm peak: could be -OH (but sharp, which is unusual)

Option C:

- IR: ester C=O (1720)
- M/Z: same as B
- NMR: two doublets for aromatic protons, but no peak at 11 ppm, which is a problem.

Option A:

- IR: aldehyde C=O (1720), O-H from hydroxy (broad)
- NMR: aldehyde proton at 11 ppm (a bit high, but possible)
- Aromatic protons: but structure leads to more than two sets? Or perhaps it's a simple case where two pairs are present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me draw it mentally. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The benzaldehyde is at position 1, Cl at position 3, and OH at position 2. So the ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. That leaves positions 4,5,6. The protons in 4 and 6 would be adjacent to the OH group, which is at 2. So perhaps those protons are equivalent and show up as a doublet. Then protons at 5 would be adjacent to Cl at 3 and opposite the aldehyde. So maybe they form another doublet. But that would give three protons, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged such that the aromatic protons split into two doublets. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 (CHO), 3 (Cl), and 2 (OH), then the neighboring protons might be in positions 4 and 6 (which are equivalent), and position 5 (another set). Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 11 ppm is not the -OH or aldehyde. Wait, another functional group that could absorb around there is an amide or something else, but the options don't include that.

Another angle: the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is typical for O-H or possibly an aliphatic amine. But the options don't have amines, except maybe option A which has a hydroxy group.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is due to an -OH group, and the sharp peak at 1720 is a carbonyl. So that would fit a carboxylic acid, ester, or aldehyde.

If it's a carboxylic acid (option B), then the M+ is 156, which fits. The NMR aromatic protons would fit as two doublets. The 11 ppm peak is the -OH, but I'm unsure about the singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a singlet because there's only one proton, which is the case for the -OH.

Wait, in the NMR, the -OH would typically be a broad peak, but in the data, it's a singlet. Maybe the sample was treated in such a way that the -OH is not exchanging, or maybe it's a deuterated exchange. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the -OH. I'm a bit stuck on that.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid

C) Phenyl chloroformate

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Another approach: the presence of a singlet at 11 ppm. If it's not an aldehyde or -OH, what else could it be? Maybe a ketone? But ketones don't have protons. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton in a highly deshielded environment, but that's unlikely to be a singlet.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak could be a carbonyl oxygen, but I don't think that's right. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, but that seems off.

Wait, perhaps the 11 ppm peak is the aldehyde proton. But then, the IR should show a peak for the aldehyde. So in option A, the IR would have a strong peak at around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch (the "banana" bonds), which are usually around there. But the IR data given is a broad peak from 3500-2700, which includes those regions. So the broad peak would encompass the O-H and aldehyde C-H stretches. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 would be the aldehyde's C=O, which fits.

So for option A:

- IR: O-H (broad) and aldehyde C=O (1720)
- NMR: aldehyde proton at 11 ppm (singlet)
- Aromatic protons: in this structure, after substituents at 1,2,3, the remaining protons would be at 4,5,6. Are any of them equivalent? If substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then position 4 is adjacent to Cl, 5 is adjacent to OH and CHO, and 6 is adjacent to OH. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure leads to two sets of aromatic protons, each integrating for 2H, which would match the NMR data.

But I'm not entirely confident about that. So, in option A, the aromatic protons would likely show more splitting than two doublets. Or perhaps it would be a different pattern.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that the aromatic ring has two pairs of equivalent protons, that would fit the NMR data. Let me think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would have Cl at 2, COOH at 1. The aromatic protons would be at 3,4,5,6. Protons 3 and 5 would be equivalent, and 4 and 6 would also be equivalent. Each pair would be a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons. So their NMR would show two doublets, which matches the data. But the 11 ppm peak would still need to be explained.

So, option D has the same molecular formula as B and C. The IR would show O-H and C=O. The NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons. The 11 ppm peak could be the -OH, but again, I'm not sure about the singlet.

Wait, another point: the presence of a singlet at 11 ppm. If it's the aldehyde, you'd also expect a peak in the IR for the aldehyde's O-H (usually around 2720 cm^-1 as a sharp peak, but the given IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could include that. However, the strong sharp peak is at 1720, which is the aldehyde's C=O. But the O-H of the aldehyde is usually a small peak around 2720, but it's not as strong as the C=O.

Putting all together, it seems that option B is the best fit because:

- The molecular ion matches at 156.
- The isotope peak at 158 makes sense due to Cl.
- The IR shows O-H and a C=O which fits a carboxylic acid.
- The NMR aromatic protons fit a para-substituted benzoic acid (two doublets), and the 11 ppm peak is the -OH.

Even though the -OH in benzoic acid is usually a broad peak, maybe in this case, it's a sharp singlet, perhaps due to the sample conditions or being in a solid state. So I'll go with option B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and the isotope peak at **m/z = 158** suggest a molecular formula of **C₇H₅ClO₂**, with the isotope peak corresponding to the natural abundance of chlorine-37. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between **3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹**, consistent with a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at **11.0 ppm** (likely an acidic proton) and two doublets at **8.02 ppm** and **7.72 ppm**, corresponding to aromatic protons.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- This compound contains an aldehyde group, a hydroxyl group, and a chlorine atom. 
- The aldehyde proton typically appears as a singlet around **9-10 ppm**, but the given NMR shows a singlet at **11.0 ppm**, which is slightly higher than expected for an aldehyde. 
- The aromatic protons would not split into two doublets as described in the NMR data, as the substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl) would create a more complex splitting pattern. 
- The IR spectrum would show both an O-H stretch and a C=O stretch for the aldehyde, but the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than an aldehyde.

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position. 
- The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** matches the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**, and the isotope peak at **m/z = 158** is consistent with the natural abundance of chlorine-37.
- The IR spectrum is consistent with a carboxylic acid, as it shows a broad O-H stretch and a strong C=O stretch at **1720 cm⁻¹**.
- The ¹H NMR spectrum matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzoic acid: two doublets at **8.02 ppm** and **7.72 ppm** for the aromatic protons, and a singlet at **11.0 ppm** for the acidic -OH proton. While carboxylic acid -OH protons are typically broad, the sharp singlet could result from sample conditions or the solid state.

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- This compound contains an ester group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). 
- The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** matches the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**, but the IR spectrum does not support this structure. The ester carbonyl would appear around **1720-1750 cm⁻¹**, but the absence of an O-H stretch in the IR spectrum makes this option unlikely.
- Additionally, the NMR data does not fit, as phenyl chloroformate would not have a singlet at **11.0 ppm** or two doublets for aromatic protons.

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- This compound contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position. 
- The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** matches the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**, and the isotope peak at **m/z = 158** is consistent with chlorine-37.
- However, the NMR data does not fit this structure. The aromatic protons for 2-chlorobenzoic acid would not split into two doublets as described in the NMR data, as the substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl) would create a different splitting pattern.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, isotope peak, IR spectrum, and ¹H NMR spectrum, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid (Option B)**. The molecular formula matches, the IR spectrum supports the presence of a carboxylic acid, and the NMR data aligns with the expected aromatic proton splitting and the singlet at **11.0 ppm** for the -OH proton.

**Answer: B**
