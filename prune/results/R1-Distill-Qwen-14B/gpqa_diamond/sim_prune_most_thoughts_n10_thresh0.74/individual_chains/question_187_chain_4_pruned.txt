Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on the signal-to-noise ratio. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is asking how many of the listed stars would have a S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure.

First, I think I need to figure out the criteria for detectability. The S/N ratio is important because a higher S/N means the signal is stronger relative to noise, making the star easier to detect. The factors that influence S/N would be the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) and the exposure time, but since the exposure is fixed at 1 hour, I think the key is the star's brightness as seen from Earth.

Wait, the ESPRESSO instrument's sensitivity depends on the star's flux. So I should probably calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and then see if the instrument can achieve the required S/N.

The given options are a) to f), each with different distances. For each, the absolute V magnitude is 15 mag, which is pretty faint. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me calculate m for each option:

a) Canopus: I know Canopus is a very bright star. Wait, what's its apparent magnitude? I think it's around -0.7. So that's way brighter than the others. But wait, the options are a) to f), with a) being Canopus, and the others have absolute magnitude 15 mag. So I probably need to compute m for each star except a), because Canopus's brightness is known.

Wait, but the question says "the stars listed below" include a) to f). Oh wait, a) is Canopus, which I should treat as a known bright star. So let's get back.

Option a) Canopus: known, so m is about -0.7. That's extremely bright.

Options b) Polaris: Polaris is a variable star, I think its apparent magnitude is around 1.8 to 2.0. But wait, is that correct? Wait, I've heard it's about 1.9 or so. So Polaris is a second-magnitude star.

Options c) to f): All have absolute magnitude 15 mag, but different distances.

So let's compute the apparent magnitude for each:

c) Distance 10 pc. So using M = 15, d=10 pc. The distance modulus is 5*(log10(10/10)) = 5*(0) =0. So m = 15 + 0 = 15 mag.

d) Distance 200 pc: log10(200/10)=log10(20)=1.301. So 5 * 1.301 =6.505. m=15+6.505=21.505 mag.

e) Distance 5 pc: d/10=0.5. log10(0.5)= -0.301. 5*(-0.301)= -1.505. m=15-1.505=13.495 mag.

f) Distance 50 pc: d/10=5. log10(5)=0.698. 5*0.698=3.49. m=15+3.49=18.49 mag.

Wait, so each of these has an apparent magnitude as follows:

a) Canopus: ~-0.7

b) Polaris: ~1.9

c) 15 mag

e) ~13.5 mag

f) ~18
