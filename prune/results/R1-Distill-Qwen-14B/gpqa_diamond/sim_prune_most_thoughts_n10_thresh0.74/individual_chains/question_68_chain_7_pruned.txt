Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Right, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin operator. Sz is the spin component along the z-axis. So mu = γ S_z, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio or something like that.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, so it's in an eigenstate of S_z. That makes sense because in a magnetic field, the system will be in an eigenstate of the corresponding spin component. So the initial state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off. Wait, when the field is off, the particle's energy isn't influenced by the magnetic field anymore. But then another field is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So now the magnetic field is in the Y-direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, so the new field is B in Y.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starting to oscillate. So they're looking for the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩.

I think this has to do with the time evolution of the state when the Hamiltonian changes. Initially, when the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian was proportional to S_z. Then the field switched to Y, so the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Wait, when the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ·B. Oh wait, more precisely, the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y, because the magnetic moment is μ = γ S. So the interaction energy is μ·B, which when B is in Y direction becomes γ B S_y (since μ is γ S, so μ · B would be γ B S_y if B is along Y). Wait, but the sign? Oh, right, Hamiltonian is usually H = -μ·B. So H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is μ = γ S. The potential energy is U = -μ·B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B = -γ S · B. If B is along Y, then H = -γ B S_y.

But wait, let me make sure. Oh, wait, actually, sometimes it's written as H = -μ·B, but μ is given as γ S_z. Wait, wait, the problem states mu = gamma * S_z. Oh! Oh wait, that's a crucial point. The magnetic moment here is given as mu = γ S_z. But in reality, for spin-1/2 particles, the magnetic moment is proportional to the total spin, not just S_z. Hmm, maybe that's a simplification in the problem.

Wait, the problem says mu equals gamma * S_z. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction. So when the magnetic field is applied along Z, the interaction energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is applied along Y, the interaction would involve S_y. Hmm.

So, initially, the particle is in an eigenstate
