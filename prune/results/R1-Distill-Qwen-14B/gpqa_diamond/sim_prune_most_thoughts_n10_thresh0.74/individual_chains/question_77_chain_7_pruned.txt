Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, that's a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me draw that structure. The substituent is OCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2... Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- with a methyl on the third carbon? Wait, wait, but but has four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂- but wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, so the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- as a substituent. But in this case, it's 3-methyl, so the substituent is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)-. So the substituent is OCH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH₂? No, wait. Wait, the group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- as a substituent. Wait, but the substituent is but-2-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH2-O- attached to benzene? Wait, no, the substituent is OCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2? Or wait, maybe it's OCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

The substituent is (3-m
