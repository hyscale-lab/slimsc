Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of particle physics concepts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances in meters, so I need to calculate the correct mean distance.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think should be something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

Wait, but how do I find the mean lifetime τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should make sure I remember the units correctly here. Γ is given in MeV, which is energy, and τ should be in seconds.

So first, let me convert the width Γ from MeV to GeV because E_X and m_X are in GeV. Oh wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the width Γ is given as 320 MeV. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, right? Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

But wait, when calculating τ, we use Γ in appropriate units. So, the formula: τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in GeV. I need to make sure the units are compatible.

Wait, ħ (h-bar) is Planck's constant divided by 2π. Its value is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh right, because in particle physics, units are often converted to GeV and seconds. So when Γ is in GeV, the time will be in seconds.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug the numbers in. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is
