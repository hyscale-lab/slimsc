Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, but I'm a bit rusty. Let's take it step by step.

The question starts with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring connected via a methylene group to the aldehyde. The trans part probably refers to the double bond geometry, but maybe that's not super important for this reaction.

First, trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. Methyl magnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent, which typically adds to carbonyl groups. Aldehydes react with Grignard reagents to form secondary alcohols. So, the aldehyde group (RCHO) would become RCH(O^-)OMgBr, then after workup (adding acid), it becomes RCH2OH. Wait, no, more accurately, the Grignard adds once to the aldehyde. Aldehydes have a carbonyl, so when the Grignard attacks, it adds a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon.

So, the structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is probably benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is more like cinnamic aldehyde. Its structure is CH₂=CH-C₆H₄-CHO? Wait, no. Let me think: cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. Oh right, structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but with a double bond between the CH and CH
