Okay, let me try to figure out this qPCR question. So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in three technical replicates each. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the target. The R2 is 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the curve fits the data perfectly. The slope is -3.3, which I think relates to the efficiency and the calculation of the data.

Looking at his results: as the concentration decreases from 100,000 to 10 copies per Âµl, the Ct values increase. That makes sense because lower starting amounts would take more cycles to reach the threshold. For example, 100,000 copies have a Ct of around 24, and 10 copies have a Ct around 20.7. Wait, wait, no, actually, the Ct increases as the starting amount decreases. So 10 copies have a higher Ct than, say, 100 copies? Wait no, higher Ct means more cycles needed, which implies lower starting quantity. So 10 copies have a lower quantity, higher Ct. Oh wait, no, wait: when you have more copies, it reaches the threshold earlier, so lower Ct. So a 100,000 copy sample would have a lower Ct than a 10 copy sample. But in the data given, the Ct for 100,000 is about 24, and 10 is 20.7. Wait, that's lower Ct than higher concentration. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I mixed it up. Let me think again. If you have more target copies, it will reach the fluorescence threshold sooner, so lower Ct. So 100,000 copies would have a Ct of around 24, which is lower than 10 copies having a Ct of 20.7. Wait, that can't be right because 10 copies are way lower than 100,000. So why is their Ct lower? That doesn't make sense. Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 for 10
