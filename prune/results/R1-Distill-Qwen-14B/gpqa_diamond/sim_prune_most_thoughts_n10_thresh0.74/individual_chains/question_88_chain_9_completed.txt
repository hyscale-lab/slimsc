Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Let me try to break it down.

So, the setup is that they tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and give them to mice orally. Then they do in vivo imaging. From what I remember, when you give something orally, it goes through the stomach first. The stomach has a lot of acid, which can break things down. They saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. That makes sense because stomach acid is harsh, and maybe the GFP was degraded there. But some of it did make it past the stomach.

Next, these GFP-tagged proteins reached the intestines, but some got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs, like Peyer's patches, right? Peyer's patches are in the small intestine and are sites where immune responses are initiated, especially for things that are ingested or come into contact with the gut.

They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cell population. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and saw high variability. Hmm, variable heavy chain genes are part of the immunoglobulins, like antibodies. High variability suggests that these cells are undergoing some kind of diversification of their antibodies.

Now, the question is about which process is happening. The options are somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching recombination, or VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each option. Somatic hypermutation occurs during the immune response, especially in B cells. This process introduces mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, which increases the diversity of antibodies. This typically happens after the initial antigen recognition, leading to more specific and stronger immune responses.

Complement activation is part of the immune system's response to pathogens. It's a series of reactions that help clear pathogens by marking them for destruction and recruiting other immune cells. But I don't think this process affects the variable regions of antibodies directly. It's more about the destruction of the pathogen.

Class switching recombination, or isotype switching, is when the type of antibody produced by a B cell changes. For example, switching from producing IgM to IgG. This doesn't change the variable regions but the class of the antibody. So the variable heavy chain gene wouldn't show high variability here; the class would change, but the variable part remains the same.

VDJ recombination is the process that happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's how the variable, diversity, and joining regions of the heavy chain are combined to create a vast array of antibodies. This happens during the maturation of B cells, not in response to a specific antigen. So if the cells are already mature and responding to an antigen, VDJ wouldn't be active anymore.

Putting this together: the experiment involved an immune response because the proteins reached the Peyer's patches, which are part of the immune system. The cells in the Peyer's patches that are proliferating are likely activated B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene suggests that these cells are undergoing a process that diversifies their antibody genes after antigen exposure. That sounds like somatic hypermutation, which happens during the germinal center reactions in secondary lymphoid tissues. Germinal centers are where B cells proliferate, undergo hypermutation, and compete, leading to the selection of higher affinity B cells.

Wait, but also, VDJ occurs during B cell development. But in this case, the cells have already been exposed to the antigen and are proliferating. So the process observed here is after the initial VDJ recombination, which was in the bone marrow. So the subsequent process is somatic hypermutation, which increases diversity further in response to the specific antigen.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are exposed to stomach acid, where some fluorescence is destroyed, and others become entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, suggesting a process that diversifies antibody genes.

To determine the process, the options are analyzed:

- **Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations in the variable region of B cell receptors after antigen exposure, increasing antibody diversity. It occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, consistent with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene.
- **Complement activation**: This is a part of the immune response that targets pathogens for destruction but does not directly affect antibody variability.
- **Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the variable region, so it does not explain the observed variability.
- **VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, creating initial diversity in antibody genes. However, it is not active in mature B cells responding to antigens in secondary lymphoid organs.

Given the context of antigen exposure and the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**, which diversifies antibodies in response to specific antigens.

Answer: A
