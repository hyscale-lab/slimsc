Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and pH calculations can get tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, so first, I think I should figure out what's happening when these acids and bases are mixed. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But I also need to consider the types of acids and bases here.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Oh wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it dissociates completely in water, right? So when you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- ions will react to form water.

But wait, there are two acids and one base. So I think the HCl and CH3COOH will donate H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. The reaction between H+ and OH- will produce water. The excess of either H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So my plan is:

1. Calculate the moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine the net moles of H+ or OH- after neutralization.
3. Find out which is in excess.
4. Calculate the concentration of H+ or OH- in the total solution volume.
5. Use that to find the pH.

Let me write down the volumes and molarities:

- CH3COOH: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.
- HCl: 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.
- Ba(OH)2: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So total OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, wait. I need to think about how each contributes H+ or OH-.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it only donates some H+ (but in solution, it dissociates partially). However, since it's a weak acid, when calculating neutralization with a strong base, it's often treated as contributing H+ equal to its moles. But when mixed with another acid and a base, maybe the reaction is more complex.

Hold on, the problem is a mixture of multiple acids and a base. So the H+ comes from all the acids, and the OH- from the base.

So total H+ from acids: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So HCl contributes 0.08 mol H+. CH3COOH as weak acid, but in the presence of a strong base, how does that affect it? Hmm. Wait, but mixing all together, the H+ and OH- from the base will react with both H+ sources.

Wait, no. Let's think again. All solutions are mixed together, so the first thing that will happen is the reaction between H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

So, let me sum all the H+ and OH-:

Total H+ contributed by HCl and CH3COOH:
HCl: 0.08 mol H+ (since HCl â†’ H+ + Cl-)
CH3COOH: 0.05 mol H+ (since it's a weak acid but for initial neutralization, we'll assume all H+ is available. Or wait, maybe I should think about it as just adding up the H+ contributions.)

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I think the approach is to calculate all H+ from acids and OH- from the base, then subtract to see what's left.

So:

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH:
HCl: 0.08 mol (since HCl is strong, all dissociates)
CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (since it's a weak acid, but in solution, can it donate H+? Or in the presence of a strong base, do I assume that the weak acid H+ is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl? Hmm,
