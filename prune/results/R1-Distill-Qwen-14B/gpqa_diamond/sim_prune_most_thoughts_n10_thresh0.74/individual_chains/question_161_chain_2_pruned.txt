Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let's see what it's about. Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, right? They're using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, below 10^-9 Torr. The reason for such a low pressure is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment because those can affect electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

But even with all that pumping, some gas molecules are still present. The mass spectrometer detects them, so Mike knows there's a small number of gas particles. He determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with low pressure, the mean free path is longer because molecules don't hit each other as often. So λ1 is based on the current conditions—volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then Mike starts the electron beam, and he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, which isn't equal to λ1. The temperature is the same, so that factor isn't changing. So why would the mean free path change?

Wait, the mean free path in gases depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. Oh wait, but wait, the mean free path for electron scattering might be different because electrons have a different interaction with the gas molecules.

Wait, in this case, when Mike starts the electron beam, the electrons are moving at a high velocity. The gas molecules, being neutral, might have a different effect when the electrons are present. But wait, in a vacuum, the electrons wouldn't interact much with the gas because the gas is at ultra-high vacuum. But in this case, the gas is present, so the electrons would scatter off the gas molecules.

But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. Hmm, no, wait. Let me read the question again. Mike determined λ1 as the mean free path of the gas molecules. Then upon initiating the electron beam, he observes that the mean free path is λ2. So what's causing this change?

Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in some way. For instance, the electrons could cause the gas molecules to ionize. If that happens, the gas becomes charged, and the ions might be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. Or perhaps the gas molecules are being knocked out of the compartment because the beam is energetic enough to eject them, thereby reducing the pressure.

Wait, but if the pressure changes, that would affect the mean free path. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So if the pressure in the compartment increases (unlikely because Mike is using pumps), or decreases. Wait, but if the electron beam somehow causes the gas to be pumped out more, the pressure would drop, increasing λ. Or maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, considering the electrons' motion: the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds because 1000 kV is a high
