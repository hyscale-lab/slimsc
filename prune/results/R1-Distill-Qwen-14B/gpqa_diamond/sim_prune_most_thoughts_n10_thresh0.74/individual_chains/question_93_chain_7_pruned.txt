Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm still trying to get a good grasp on. Let's see what the problem is here.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted samples, each with three technical replicates. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means that each cycle doubles the target perfectly. The R² was 1, so that's a perfect correlation, meaning the data fits the curve really well. The slope was -3.3. Hmm, wait, I remember that the slope in qPCR calibration curves is related to the efficiency. The equation for the slope is usually -3.32 divided by the efficiency. Oh wait, if efficiency is 100%, then E=1. So the slope should be -3.32 approximately. So the slope here is -3.3, which is close enough considering possible rounding. So the calibration curve should be okay.

Now, looking at his results: at each concentration, the Ct values vary a little among the three replicates. For example, at 100,000 copies, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So each is about 0.3 apart. Similarly, all other concentrations have Ct values that are roughly 0.3 to 0.6 apart. The question is why there are discrepancies in the results.

The options are A to D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But wait, he did get a perfect R². If the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, qPCR works fine. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target nucleic acid amounts. But the concentrations are tenfold each time, and the Ct's are decreasing by about 3.3 each time. Wait, let's see. 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x decrease, and the Ct goes from 33.9 to 30.6. The difference is about 3.3 cycles, which makes sense because with 100% efficiency, each 10x dilution should take about 3.3 more cycles. So the Ct's are in line with the concentration. So B might not be the right reason for the discrepancy.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, ten-fold would correspond to about 3.3 cycles difference, right? So if the dilution is tenfold, the Ct should change by about 3.3. But in the data, the differences are exactly around that. For example, 100,000 to 10,000: 33.9 to 30.6. The difference is about 3.3. So why would this be a problem? Oh wait, the option says 'more than 3.3', but in this case, it's exactly that. So maybe this isn't the issue. Or perhaps the question is about the replicates, not the dilutions.

Option D says the deviation between
