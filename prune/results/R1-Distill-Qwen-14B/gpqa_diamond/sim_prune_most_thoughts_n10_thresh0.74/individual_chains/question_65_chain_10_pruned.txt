Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have two reactions, and we need to determine the major products A and B. Then, we'll match them with the options given.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A. The second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

I need to figure out what each of these reactions does.

Starting with the first reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the first carbon. The structure is a bit complex, but I imagine it as a bicyclic system with a spiro junction. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) and an alcohol group (-OH) on the same carbon.

The reaction conditions are THF (a solvent), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and then H+ (acid workup). So, what's happening here? Well, strong bases like KH are often used for deprotonation, especially in situations where the proton is acidic. Alcohols are somewhat acidic, but maybe in this case, the spiro system has some ring strain or other factors that make the hydroxyl proton more acidic.

Wait, spiro systems can create angle strain or unique acidity due to their structure. The alcohol here is on a spiro carbon, which might make it more acidic than regular alcohols. So, when treated with a strong base like KH, the hydroxyl group could deprotonate to form an alkoxide.

But wait, with a base like LDA, you usually get enolate formation. But here, the base is KH. Hmm, maybe it's similar. Deprotonation of the alcohol would form an alkoxide, but what's next? Since we have a conjugated double bond (vinyl group) and an spiro system, perhaps a ring-opening or some kind of elimination could occur.

Wait, another possibility: this might involve a pinacol-like rearrangement or some kind of Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Or maybe it's a conjugate addition or elimination. Alternatively, since there's an alkene and an alcohol, perhaps an acid-catalyzed process is happening, but the base might be involved in deprotonating for an elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? The spiro structure might undergo some ring-forming or ring-opening under these conditions.

Wait, but the reaction also involves H+ work-up. So, after the base does its thing, maybe the product is protonated.

Alternatively, if the alcohol is deprotonated by KH, perhaps an E2 elimination occurs, removing the hydroxyl group and a hydrogen to form a double bond, but in this case, the molecule already has a double bond (vinyl). So maybe the spiro system will undergo some ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, another
