Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orbital distance.

The question gives two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter. Wait, orbital period being shorter means it's closer to its star, right? Because a shorter period implies a smaller orbit, based on Kepler's laws.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because usually more massive stars are bigger, but here they're the same size. Maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved, but the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh, but both have the same radii, so that's a given.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The probability formula, if I recall, is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis. But wait, no, I think it's more precise to say that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 times the chance that the orbital plane is aligned. Wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_*/ a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since these orbits are circular (e=0), that term is 1. So the transit probability is (R_*/(a)) * (something else?), or maybe it's (R_*/(a)) / (something else)?

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability P is P ≈ (R_* / a) * (some factor). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The probability of a transit is given by the condition that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, must be aligned such that the planet passes directly in front of the star. The formula I remember is P ≈ (R_*/ a) * ( (1) / (sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) ), but that's when b is the impact parameter, which for a circular orbit is a*sin(i), where i is the inclination. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is approximately (R_*/ a) * (1 / (1 - (R_*/ a)^2))^0.5 )? Or is it just (R_*/a) * (something else). Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the ratio of the distance the planet can cover in its orbit that would cause a transit.

Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. No, that's not quite right. Wait, I think the probability is calculated based on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. More precisely, the probability is proportional to the area of the circle where the planet's path
