Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through each step carefully.

The question involves several reactions starting with benzene. I'll break down each step one by one.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration of benzene typically occurs under these conditions. Benzene reacts with a nitronium ion (NO2+), which substitutes a hydrogen in benzene. The nitration is a meta-directing group. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait. No, nitration adds a nitro group. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene. So the nitro group is at the para position? No, wait, nitration is usually a meta director when adding a second group. But in this case, it's the first substitution. So the product is nitrobenzene. Or wait, no, nitration adds a nitro group directly. So yeah, product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, nitration of benzene is a meta director when there's another substituent, but in this case, it's just benzene. So when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group can be in any position, but since benzene is symmetric, it's a single product. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe. That's a bromination reaction. Now, nitro groups are strong meta directors. So when you brominate nitrobenzene, the Br adds to the meta position relative to the nitro group. So nitrobenzene (which is benzene with a nitro group in position 1) would, upon bromination, add Br in position 3. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene, or 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The nitro group is in position 1. The bromine adds in position 3 (meta to nitro). So product 2 is 3-bromo-1-nitrobenzene.

Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, typically reducing multiple bonds. So the nitro group (NO2) would be reduced to an amino group (NH2). So product 3
