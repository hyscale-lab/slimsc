Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So both have about the same mass, same star mass. They found the planets using the RV method, so the spectral lines shift periodically as the star moves toward and away from us.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, the orbital period depends on the velocity of the star. Because the RV method measures the star's velocity change. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K equals ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2))) ) or something like that. Oh wait, maybe a simpler version.

I remember that for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * c ) )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star (since Neptune is much less massive than Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So we can approximate that as M. Also, because the planets are in circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero, so that term cancels out or is 1.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2πG) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * c )

But wait, since both planets have the same mass and same star mass, and same inclination (otherwise Kepler's third law would account for inclination, but I think in this case, since it's just the RV method, the shift is K multiplied by sin i. But the problem doesn't mention inclination, so I think we can assume sin i is the same for both planets, maybe i=90 degrees, so sin i=1. Or perhaps it's not given, but since the question is about the ratio, maybe sin i cancels out.

So, the formula for K would be proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star)^(2/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

Wait, let's write that as K ∝ (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

But since M_p is same for both planets (Neptune mass), and M_star is same (Sun's mass), the ratio of K for planet 1 and K for planet 2 would depend on 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, no, let's think again. Let me write the formula.

K = ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) c ) )

So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because if P increases, K decreases.

Wait, so K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)).

Therefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, let me rearrange:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So, P ∝ 1 / K^(3)

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Because if K2 is larger than K1, the period P would be smaller. Because if the star is moving faster (larg
