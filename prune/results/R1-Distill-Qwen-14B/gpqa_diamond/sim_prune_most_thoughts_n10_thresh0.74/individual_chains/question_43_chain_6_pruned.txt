Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because nomenclature can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about determining the correct IUPAC name of a benzene ring with several substituents.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure based on the description. Let me read the question again. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, each of these three groups is separated by one carbon (meta) on the ring.

Wait, no, meta in benzene terms means each is two positions apart. So if one is at position 1, the others would be at 3 and 5. But wait, the question says they are all meta to one another. Hmm, that might not be possible on a benzene ring because three substituents can't all be meta to each other. Let me think. Oh wait, perhaps the three groups are arranged such that each is meta relative to the others, but maybe that's not possible. Maybe it's that each is meta with respect to the others, but that might require specific positions. Alternatively, perhaps the three groups are in such a way that each is meta to the next. Maybe I should draw a benzene ring and try to place them.

But before that, let's note all the substituents:

1. Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
2. Carbaldehyde group (-CHO)
3. Cyano group (-CN)
4. Ortho
