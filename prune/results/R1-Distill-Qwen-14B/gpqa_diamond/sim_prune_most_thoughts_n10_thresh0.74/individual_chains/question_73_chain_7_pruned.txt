Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right. When dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally because of relativistic effects. Oh right, I remember the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. Because that's not considering the relativity part, so that's probably not the correct answer.

So let me plug in the numbers. The astronaut moving at 0.6c is in the frame of the other astronaut moving at 0.5c. Or wait, no, actually, I think in this case, the relative speed formula is used when one is in the rest frame of the other. So if astronaut A is at 0.6c and astronaut B is at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's perspective, what is B's speed?

Wait, no, maybe I should think it the other way. If both are moving in the same direction relative to an outside frame, then from A's frame, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, no, I have to be careful with the direction. If A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, then in A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let's compute that.

So numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. Hmm, the negative sign indicates direction. Since speed is a magnitude, the relative speed is about 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c, which is option C or D.

Wait, but wait, no. The question is about the relative speed. But wait, in relativity, velocity is frame-dependent. So the relative speed between the two astronauts would depend on which frame we're considering. Wait, but the problem states "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" Hmm, perhaps the relative speed is between them as observed from the rest frame of the combined system. Or maybe from one astronaut's perspective.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the relative speed when one astronaut is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.6c, the other is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)c²
