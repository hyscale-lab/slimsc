Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function should have a certain normalization condition, right? Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function given here is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. The absolute square would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. Because for any complex number z = z_real + i z_imag, |z|^2 is z_real^2 + z_imag^2.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - (0.5)i.

So |ψ(x)|² would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the wave function as given is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. Or is it? Because the wave
