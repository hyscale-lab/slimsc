Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earths. Both orbits are circular. The problem gives some data about the Doppler shifts induced by each planet on a forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of 0.03 Å, Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å. Both have the same albedo.

The key here is to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels when taking the ratio.

But wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²)) ^ 0.25. Alternatively, since L (luminosity) of the star is given, but perhaps we can express it using the star's properties.

Alternatively, another formula: The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4). But wait, since both planets have the same albedo, A is same, so it will cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Hmm, wait, that's because the sqrt becomes sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, but wait, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T
