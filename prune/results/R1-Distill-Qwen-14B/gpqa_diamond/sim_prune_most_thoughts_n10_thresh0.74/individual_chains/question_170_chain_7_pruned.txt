Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component spinor. So, let's denote the state as χ = [3i, 4]^T. I'm pretty sure when dealing with spins, we usually work with spinors in the basis of up and down states.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket product: <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Right, and S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices come into play here. The y-component of the spin operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli y-matrix, σ_y. 

Looking back, the note gives σ_y as the matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. 

Wait, but the spinor is given as (3i, 4). Let me write that down. So χ is a column vector with first element 3i and second 4. But wait, when we take the bra, it's the conjugate transpose. So χ† would be [ -3 (because 3i* is -3i?), 4 ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The vector χ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose is a row vector where each component is the complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 remains 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

But when I compute χ† S_y χ, I have to multiply these out. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each part separately.

Wait, perhaps I should write down the matrix S_y in terms of σ_y. Right, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the operator is represented by that matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So the expectation value is χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ. So let's compute that step by step.

First, compute S_y * χ. Let's write it out:

S_y is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So S_y * χ is (ħ/2) times [ [0*(3i) + (-i)*(4)], [i*(3i) + 0*(4)] ].

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*(3i) is 0, (-i)*4 is -4i. So first component is -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) is 3i², which is 3*(-1) = -3. And 0*4 is 0. So second component is -3.

So S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck the multiplication. Oh wait,
