Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighs 7.20 grams. They were heated to 200°C without air. So, I'm thinking maybe they decomposed or reacted in some way when heated, especially without oxygen since it's without air. 

When they heated the salts, only a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were then passed through several tubes. Let me list the setup:

1. Tube №1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So, Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, but it's anhydrous, which I think means it's used to absorb moisture. But wait, in this case, maybe it's absorbing something else because the gas passed through it caused the tube's weight to increase by 3.60 grams. Hmm.

2. Tube №2 has a Ca(OH)2 solution. So, Ca(OH)2 is slaked lime, which can react with acidic gases. But their weight didn't change. So, maybe no reaction happened here. Or perhaps the gas didn't contain any acidic components that would react with Ca(OH)2.

3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper. I remember that red-hot copper can react with certain gases. For example, when CO2 is passed over hot copper, it doesn't react. But when CO is passed through, it might react because CO can be oxidized. Wait, but red-hot copper is usually in a reducing environment. Alternatively, maybe it's about SO2 or another gas. Oh, but the product formed is CuO. So, the gas must have been something that reacts with copper to form oxide. Like, maybe CO2 doesn't react, but SO3 might. Wait, but SO3 is a strong acid anhydride, so it would react with Mg(ClO4)2. Hmm, maybe the gas was H2S? No, because H2S might not react with Cu in this way. Alternatively, perhaps it's water vapor, but copper doesn't react with water vapor when hot, unless it's in a reducing environment. Wait, maybe the gas is something like CO or H2. Or perhaps another possibility.

After passing through, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained under standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 22.4 L/mol, so 2.24 L is 0.1 mol. So, gas C is 0.1 moles.

Let me think about each step. The initial salts are A and B, equimolar. When heated, they produce gases. The gases pass through the first tube, which gains 3.6 g. Then the second tube doesn't change. The third gains 0.8 g, and 2.24 L of gas remains.

So, let's try to model the reactions.

First, what could cause Mg(ClO4)2 to absorb mass? Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can act as a desiccant. But if it's reacting with a gas, perhaps it's absorbing water, but if the gas is water vapor, then the weight gain would be the mass of the water. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is not a typical gas absorber, but maybe it's a catalyst or a drying agent. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something that combines with Mg(ClO4)2 to form a hydrate. Wait, but anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water as a drying agent, so if the gas was H2O vapor, the tube's mass would increase by the mass of H2O absorbed. So, the 3.60 g might be the mass of H2O.

Wait, but is that possible? Let me think. If the gas mixture contained water vapor, then the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. So, the mass increase of 3.6 g would be the mass of H2O. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, it will react with water:

Mg(ClO4)2 (anhydrous) + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O (hydrated).

So, the mass increase would be the mass of H2O absorbed. So, 3.6 g of H2O would be 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

So, that's 0.2 moles of H2O.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had acid gases (like CO2, SO2, HCl, etc.), the solution would react and gain mass. But in this case, the weight didn't change, so perhaps there were no acidic gases. So, the gas after the first tube didn't contain any CO2 or SO2, because Ca(O
