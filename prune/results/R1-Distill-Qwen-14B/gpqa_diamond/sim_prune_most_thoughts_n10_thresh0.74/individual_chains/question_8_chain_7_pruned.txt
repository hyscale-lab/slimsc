Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Hmm. I'll need to think it through carefully.

So the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3, and they've created knockout mutants for each and also some double mutants. The experiment measures their resistance to anthracnose. The control has 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that suggests that this gene is a regulator, maybe activating other genes involved in the resistance pathway.

Looking at the results:

- g1: 75% → so it's less resistant than wild type. So the gene product of G1 is contributing to resistance. Losing G1 reduces resistance by a quarter, perhaps.
- g2: 0% → so no resistance. That's a big hit. So G2's product is crucial for resistance. Without it, the plant can't resist at all.
- g3: 50% → so similar to g1 but a bit worse. So G3 is also important, but maybe less than G2.
- Double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% → even worse than either single mutant. That's a big drop.
   - g2g3: 0% → same as g2, which makes sense because if g2 is already 0%, adding another mutation doesn't change it.
   - g1g2: 0% → same as g2. So if either g1 or g2 is knocked out, the resistance is gone.

Wait a second. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%. But when g2 is knocked out alone, it's already 0. So g2 knockout is more severe. Similarly, the g2g3 double is 0%, same as g2 alone.

Hmm, what does this tell us about the hierarchy of the genes? I remember that in genetics, the idea of epistasis is where one gene's effect masks the effect of another. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutation is observed only when gene A is functional.

Looking at the data, let's think about when the resistance is 0%: in g2 alone, and in any double mutant that includes g2. So the presence of a g2 mutation seems to be the determining factor. Because when you have g2 mutant, regardless of whether g1 or g3 are mutants, the resistance is 0%.

So that suggests that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. Because if the upstream gene is knocked out, the downstream genes can't compensate. So without G2, the pathway is blocked entirely, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but what about the single mutants? G1 knockout has 75% resistance. So that's a partial loss. G3 knockout has 50% which is worse than G1. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are ineffective, but without G1, G3 is still there, but not enough. Or without G3, perhaps G1 can do some, but not as much.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, they're worse than either single. But when either G1 or G3 is knocked out alone, the effect is additive but not complete.

So perhaps in the presence of functional G2, the resistance is determined by the combination of G1 and G3. Because without G2, it's gone. But when G2 is present, the other two contribute.

So the hierarchy is G2 is upstream, then G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in parallel pathways or additive.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription
