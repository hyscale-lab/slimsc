Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm.

Alright, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, right? So a, b, and c are all the same length. In this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but waitâ€”interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which in a crystal structure is along the unit cell edge. So I think a = 10 Angstrom here.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no! Wait, wait. No, wait a second. I think in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are equal, so that's correct. But I should double-check. Right, rhombohedral means all edges are the same and all angles are the same, which can be either 60 degrees (like in a rhombohedral system with hexagonal close packing) or another value, but in this case it's 30 degrees, which is unusual but okay.

So we're to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the Miller indices vector, scaled by the unit cell parameters and the angles.

Wait, the formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is d
