Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. We're supposed to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The hydrogen atom has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. 

Wait, transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that. I know h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So plugging in the numbers: 
ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) 
Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.089e-19 J. Hmm, that's the energy in joules. To convert to electron volts maybe? Because often atomic scales are in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, no, that's for hc/lambda. Wait, but wait, the wavelength given is for the transition, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV? Wait, wait, the hydrogen atom's transition energies between levels are on the order of a few eV. For example, the Lyman series is about 10 eV, Balmer is about 3 eV or so. Wait, 0.486 micrometers is the Balmer-alpha line, which is about 13.6 eV? Or am I getting confused? Wait, no, wait, let me double-check. The Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm (which is 0.656 micrometers), but wait the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486 nm. Oh, that's the Balmer-beta line perhaps. Let me think, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. The first Balmer line is the 1-2 transition at about 656 nm, then 486 nm is the 2-3 transition? Or maybe I'm mixing up the order. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman series. Wait, Lyman is n=1 transitions. 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is in the visible range, so probably Balmer. Let me compute the energy accurately. 

Wait, 0.4861e-6 meters. So 1/lambda is 1/(0.4861e-6 m) ≈ 2057070 m^-1. Then E = hc/(lambda) = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.089e-19 J as before. To convert to eV: 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That's the ΔE.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think the param
