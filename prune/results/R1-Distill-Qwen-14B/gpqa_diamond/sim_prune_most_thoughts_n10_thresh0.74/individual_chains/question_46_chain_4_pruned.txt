Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually breaks and reforms double bonds, right? So, when a catalyst like Grubbs is involved, the reaction probably involves some kind of ring-closing or ring-opening, or maybe just breaking the double bond into different products.

The molecule given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But with Grubbs catalyst, stereochemistry might play a role because the catalyst is chiral? Or does it not matter since the starting material is racemic? Or maybe the product stereochemistry depends on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, let's draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The formula would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, it's CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, pentene has five carbons. Let me count: 1 (CH₂=CH), 2 (CH), 3 (C(CH3)), but wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, pent means five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and at C3, there's a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait: Let me write it properly. The formula is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons: 1,2,3,4,5. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3? No, that would make it 4-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm
