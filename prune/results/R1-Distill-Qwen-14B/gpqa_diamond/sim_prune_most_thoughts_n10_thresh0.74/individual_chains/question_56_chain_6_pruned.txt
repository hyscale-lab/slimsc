Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the state |3,0,0> decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... right, those are electric dipole transitions. So I remember that in such transitions, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is limited. Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, the initial state here is |3,0,0>, which has l=0 (s orbital) and m=0. So, what can it transition to?

Wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Oh wait, no. No, wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0. Because the notation is |n, l, m>, right? So l=0, which is an s orbital. But wait, wait, can an s orbital transition via dipole? Because I remember that for s orbitals (l=0), electric dipole transitions are not allowed. Because Δl can be ±1, but from 0, the only possible is +1, so l becomes 1. Oh wait, so the first transition from |3,0,0> must go to a state with l=1, and that would be a p orbital. So the state would have l=1.

So the first transition would be from l=0 to l=1. Then, from that state, what's the next step? Because the final state is |1,0,0>, which has l=0. So the second transition must take l=1 to l=0. Because from l=1, you can go to l=0 (Δl= -1), which is allowed.

So the decay involves two steps: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? → 1,0,0.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. Then, when it transitions via dipole, it goes to a state with l=1. So n has to change as well. But for hydrogen, during a transition, n can change by ±1, but wait, actually, the selection rule for n is that it can change by any integer, but in practice, the transitions are usually between adjacent energy levels because the matrix elements are non-zero only when... Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the electric dipole selection rules don't impose a restriction on Δn, but rather on Δl and Δm.

Wait, no. The selection rules for hydrogen are usually Δl = ±1 and Δn can be any (but in reality, only certain transitions are possible because of the energy differences and the matrix elements).

So, from n=3, l=0, the first transition must go to a state where l=1. So possible n values for that could be n=2 or n=4, I think. But since the initial state is n=3, and the final is n=1, perhaps the transition goes through n=2. Because going from 3
