Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem states that Compound X (with the formula C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. We need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, the first thing that comes to mind is that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh wait, that's DABCO, right? I remember DABCO is used as a base in various reactions. I think it's commonly used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, maybe through an elimination reaction. Oh wait, wait, another thought: DABCO is also used in the ring-opening of epoxides, but wait, no, in this case, the reaction might be different because the product is an epoxide. Or wait, no, perhaps it's an elimination. Let me think.

Wait, Compound X's formula is C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here, so (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So that's 6 degrees. So probably a ring and double bonds. Maybe an epoxide (which is a three-membered ring with two double bonds, but wait, actually, an epoxide is an ether with a three-membered ring, so one ring and one double bond equivalent? Hmm, maybe I should think about the product's structure.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR shows:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So two singlets for 3H each. These could be methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them, like being in a symmetric environment or on a carbonyl or something. Wait, but in an epoxide, the oxygens are in a three-membered ring, but the adjacent carbons would be connected to other groups.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), then some signals in the 126-130 range, which are likely aromatic carbons, and a couple around 140, which might be carbonyls or substituted aromatic carbons. Oh, and a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester? Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Wait, so what's that peak?

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. DABCO is a base. So if the starting material is an epoxide, perhaps the reaction is opening it. But wait, the product after reaction... Or perhaps the starting material is an alkene, and DABCO is used to epoxidize it. Because I remember that epoxidation can be done using peracids, but sometimes other methods involve using bases. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, wait. Another thought: DABCO is used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes via the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which uses an acidic peroxide. But wait, no, maybe it's the hydroxyl elimination.
