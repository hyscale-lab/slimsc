Okay, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha squared)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states can't be described by Gaussian statistics, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum computing because they can perform certain tasks that Gaussian states can't.

The relative entropy method is used here. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state |psi>.

But wait, the SchrÃ¶dinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition isn't, so the state |psi> is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity (nG) should be positive.

But wait, the question is about calculating it. Let me think about the steps.

First, I need to find rho, which is |psi><psi|. Since it's a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|, but I need to compute it.

But computing rho might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Oh wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity involves comparing the given state to a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to |psi>?

Wait, but in this case, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. The question is about the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a Gaussian state's. So maybe the reference state is the thermal state or some other Gaussian state?

Wait, no, in the relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity, sometimes the reference is the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian state, but I might be getting that mixed up with other measures like the Hilbert-Schmidt distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one you get when you take the density matrix of |psi> and then "Gaussianize" it. But
