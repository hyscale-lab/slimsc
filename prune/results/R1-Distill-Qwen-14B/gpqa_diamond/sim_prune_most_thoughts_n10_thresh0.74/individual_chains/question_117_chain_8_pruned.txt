Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think. The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. That makes them non-superimposable on their mirror image, leading to enantiomers.

Let me go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. So biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions as dimethyl dicarboxylate and at 6 and 6' as nitro groups. Wait, biphenyl can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, does it have a chiral center? I don't think so. Unless there's a stereogenic center in the substituents. Let me imagine the structure. So each 2 and 2' positions have a methyl ester and a carboxylate? Wait, the formula given is dimethyl, so the ester groups are on each ring. But each ring is connected via the 1 and 1' positions. Are any of the carbons in the substituents chiral? The ester groups are OMe and OCO something. Wait, each ester is COOCH3. So the carbon connected to the oxygen in the ester would have two oxygen atoms, a methyl, and a benzene ring. Let's see: each ester is on a benzene ring at position 2. So for the substituent, the 2-carboxylate is OMe and OCOOCH3? No, wait, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate, and it's the dimethyl ester. So each carboxylate is a methyl ester. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. Wait, but the substituents might be in positions that would allow for a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but the main structure is biphenyl. If the substituents are such that the two rings have same substituents in symmetrical positions, maybe the molecule is symmetrical and hence not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that each ring's substituents make the central carbon a chiral center.

Wait, no. The substituents on each benzene ring are at 2 and 6 positions. The 2 and 6 positions are adjacent to the point of connection (1 and 1'). Wait, in benzene, positions 1, 2, 3, etc., are around. So 1 is where the ring connects; 2 is next to it. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Hmm, 2 and 6 are across from each other? No, in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. Wait, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6? Or 1 is connected to 2 and 6? No, wait, numbering starts and each position is adjacent to the next. So position 1 has 2 and 6 as neighbors. So substituents at 2 and 6 on each benzene ring would be in positions that are across each other. So if both rings have substituents at 2 and 6, then the substituents would be in positions that are across each other on each ring. But wait, the benzene rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be on opposite sides. Hmm, but for each ring, the substituent at 2 is a methyl ester and at 6 is a nitro group. Wait, no, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So each ring has two substituents: nitro and ester. Are they on the same side or opposite? Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure. The two benzene rings are connected. Each has a nitro at 6 and a methyl ester at 2. So if I look from either side, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that are across, maybe the entire molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral centers. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. If that's the case, then no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is a chiral center. Wait, no, because it's a single bond between the two rings. The carbon atoms in biphenyl are part of the aromatic
