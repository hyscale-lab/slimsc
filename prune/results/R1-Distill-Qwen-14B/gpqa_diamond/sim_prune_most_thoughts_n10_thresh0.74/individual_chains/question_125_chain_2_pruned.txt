Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator, right? Because I remember that the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is when the potential is quadratic in each direction, so x², y², z² multiplied by some constants. But here, it's given in terms of r squared, which is the radial distance in spherical coordinates. So this is the 3D harmonic oscillator problem.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for that energy eigenvalue. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I think I should first recall how the energy levels work for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Oh right, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, in 3D, the energy can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. Or is it in terms of the sum of the individual quantum numbers?

Wait, for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). Or wait, actually, no. Let me think again. No, wait, I think the correct formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and since it's 3D, you sum them.

Alternatively, I've heard that the energy can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Oh right, that makes sense.

So the energy levels depend on the sum N. But wait, what about degeneracy? Because for each N, there are multiple states with different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations but the same sum. So the degeneracy is the number of ways to write N as a sum of
