Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a light beam moving through glass, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, special relativity comes into play. Oh wait, but wait—when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the speed of light in that medium? I'm a bit confused because I think in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But in a medium like glass, things are different because the medium has an index of refraction.

Wait, the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the medium (like glass) is c/n. But that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. Now, the medium is moving. So I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light within it.

I think in this case, I should apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because we're dealing with velocities that might be significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh wait, but wait—the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v. But the speed of light in the glass is c/n. So, what are the velocities involved here?

Let me outline the scenario
