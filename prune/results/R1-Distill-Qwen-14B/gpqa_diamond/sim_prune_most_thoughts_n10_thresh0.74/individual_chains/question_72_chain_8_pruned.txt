Okay, I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So the structure is a norbornene with an ether linkage to a tert-butyl group.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile and a catalyst, perhaps for elimination or substitution. The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So each of those positions has a Br attached to a CH2 group.

Wait, when you have a diene and something with Br, maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps a substitution. But since there are two equivalents, maybe each of the diene's methyl groups is reacting.

Wait, another thought: when you have dienes and dienophiles, but here, the starting material is a bicyclo diene. Oh, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexadiene is acting as a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Alternatively, the Br groups might act as leaving groups. When NaI is present, perhaps an SN2 substitution occurs. So each of the dibromomethyl groups (on 5 and 6 positions) might have Br leaving, and the iodide attacking, but that would just swap Br for I. Not sure if that's right.

Wait, another angle: The starting material is a norbornene, which is a bicyclic diene. When it's treated with a dienophile, it can undergo Diels-Alder. But the other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So cyclohexadiene is the diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile? Or vice versa.

Wait, norbornene
