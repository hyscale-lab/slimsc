Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it step by step. 

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). I think that might be a vector in a three-dimensional space because it has three components. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). To find its norm, I square each component and add them. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. So I guess I should normalize it first. So the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Let me note that down.

Next, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, whose eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.

The first operator is P. Its matrix elements are as follows:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, I should write that out more clearly. So the matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, that looks like a symmetric matrix, so it's probably Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

The second operator is Q, with matrix elements:

First row: [1, 0,
