Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this nuclear decay problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is how the E spectrum changes in this case.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, the energy of emitted particles depends on conservation laws—like energy and momentum. Also, the type of decay affects the spectrum. For example, in beta decay, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves a neutrino, which carries away some energy.

In the original scenario, two E particles and two V particles are emitted. Since E has a continuous spectrum, maybe V is a neutrino-like particle, massless or very light. Because when particles are emitted along with other particles that can take away energy, the spectrum becomes continuous. Like beta decay where an electron and antineutrino are emitted.

So, in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. Now, in the variant, instead of two Vs, we emit one M, which is exotic and massless. So the decay becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, but how does changing the number and type of emitted particles affect the E spectrum?

I think about the conservation of energy and momentum. In the original case, with two Vs, perhaps each V carries away some energy and momentum. Since they're emitted, they must take energy from the system, which influences the energy available for the E particles.

In the variant, one M is emitted instead of two Vs. If M is massless, like a photon or neutrino, it's going to carry energy and momentum. But since it's a single particle, the way energy is distributed might change.

In the original decay, with two Vs, the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous because each E can have a range of energies depending on how the energy is shared between E and V. But if there's only one M, perhaps the energy sharing is different.

Wait, the problem says that in the original case, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So what's the endpoint? The maximum energy an E can have. That happens when the other particles take away minimal energy. Like in beta decay, the maximum energy of the electron is when the neutrino has negligible energy (but since it's emitted, the electron can't reach that maximum unless the neutrino is massless or moving in the same direction).

Wait, but in the original case, maybe each E and V pair is emitted. Let's model this as two pairs: E and V each pair. But in any case, the presence of multiple particles leads to a continuous spectrum because the energy can be distributed in various ways.

When we change to emitting M instead of two Vs, the number of particles changes. Now, the decay emits M plus two Es. How does that affect the energy distribution?

Wait, in the original decay, you have
