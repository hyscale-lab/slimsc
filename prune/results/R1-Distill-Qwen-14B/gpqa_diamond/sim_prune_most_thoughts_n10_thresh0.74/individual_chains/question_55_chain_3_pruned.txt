Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and chemical shifts can tell us a lot about the structure. So let's look at the data given.

The NMR peaks are:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets, I think that's what dq means)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Hmm. Let's break this down. The 2.1 ppm singlet is probably an acetyl group, like the OAc in acetates. Since it's a singlet, those three protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring Hs. So the structure likely has an acetate group attached.

Now the other peaks: the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16.0 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling, which makes me think of a trans coupling in an alkene. Wait, or maybe a vinyl group. Because in alkenes, the coupling between adjacent protons is usually around 10-18 Hz. So a doublet at 7 ppm suggests maybe a proton on a double bond.

Then the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. A doublet of quadruplets would come from coupling with two different sets of protons, perhaps. Or maybe it's a triplet with some other splitting. Not sure yet.

The 1.6 ppm doublet is probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or another group. Wait, in acetates, the R group is attached to the oxygen. So perhaps this is a propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me think about the possible structures:

The options are Cis or Trans for propenyl or butenyl acetates. Propenyl would be CH2CHCH2OAc or something like that. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Or wait, propenyl would have three carbons, with a double bond between the first and second. So structure like CH2=CHCH2-OAc would be propenyl acetate. But I'm not too sure about the exact structures.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the possible structures of each option.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. So the propenyl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl would be like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's propenyl, but the substituents on the double bond would matter for the cis or trans.

Wait, wait. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But in the case of propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that can't be because that would be 1-propenyl, and the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2, but that's not right. Maybe it's CH2=CH-OAc. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the double bond.

Wait, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C
