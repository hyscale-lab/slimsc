Okay, so I have this problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to find out how many revolutions a proton makes as it accelerates from negligible kinetic energy to 950 MeV. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The main difference is that cyclotrons use a constant magnetic field, while synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field over time to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. Oh right, because as particles gain energy, their mass increases relativistically, so the magnetic field needs to adjust to maintain the correct orbit.

But wait, the question is about the number of revolutions. I think the key here is to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of times it goes around the cyclotron. Each revolution, the proton gets a little kick from the electric field, which does work on it, increasing its kinetic energy.

The proton starts with T≈0, so its initial energy is just its rest mass. The final kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So when it's accelerated, its total energy would be 938 + 950 = 1888 MeV? Or do I need to account for relativistic effects here? Hmm, maybe that's part of it.

But wait, in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is related to the magnetic field
