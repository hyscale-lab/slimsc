Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me see.

First, I remember that the question gives some info about the magnitudes each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can go down to V magnitude 17, while HIRES can handle up to 16. So, the stars need to have apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no, wait. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," which means their apparent magnitude must be less than 17. Similarly for HIRES, it's less than 16. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, magnitude scales are a bit confusing. Lower numbers are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because when a star is brighter, it's magnitude is lower. So for ESPRESSO, they can see stars brighter than 17 mag, which is m < 17. For HIRES, same logic: m < 16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude less than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any with m <16 can be seen by HIRES. Therefore, to be detected by both, the apparent V magnitude must be less than 16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is m <16, then it's automatically m <17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, then HIRES can't see it but ESPRESSO can. But the question is about stars visible with both.

So the stars that can be seen by both must have m <16. Let's look at the stars.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. To find apparent magnitude, m = M + 5 log10(d / 10). So d in parsecs, M is absolute mag.

So d =10 pc, so log(10/10)=0. So m =15.5 +0 =15.5. So m=15.5. That's less than 16. So both instruments can see it? Wait, but wait, I need to consider any extinction? Because some stars have E(B-V) which affects their apparent magnitude.

Wait, the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitudes, but it's unclear about extinction. Wait, looking at the question again: Oh, the question says, for Star3 and Star4, the E(B-V) is given, and the total absorption is 3.1 times E(B-V). So I think I need to calculate the extinction for those stars.

Wait, the question says, for Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6. So the observed V mag is the one after extinction? Or is the given V mag the
