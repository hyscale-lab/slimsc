Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to work through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Hmm, I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, the gamma matrices' commutator. And F^{μν} must be the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since it's commonly used there. So this looks like an interaction term between a fermion field and a gauge field, like in QED maybe or something similar.

But the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Okay, I need to recall how to find the mass dimension of coupling constants in a Lagrangian. The mass dimension is important because it tells us about the renormalizability—if the dimension is positive, the interaction is renormalizable, I think. Wait, no, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence, which in turn tells us about renormalizability.

Wait, I think renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Or was it that all interactions must have a coupling with non-positive mass dimension? Let me think. The general rule I remember is that for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have a mass dimension less than or equal to d/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. But wait, in 4D spacetime (d=4), the couplings should have dimension ≤ 2. Because higher than that and the theory is nonrenormalizable.

So, each term in the Lagrangian should have a mass dimension of 4 because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. Because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over four dimensions, the action (which is dimensionless) is the integral of L d^4x, so L must have dimension 4.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So, let's look at L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I need to compute the mass dimension of each field in this term. Let me list what I remember about the masses of these fields.

The fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 in 4D. Because in general, for a Dirac spinor, the mass dimension is (d-1)/2. So for d=4, (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So each ψ is dimension 3/2, and ψ̄ is also 3/2 because it's the adjoint, same dimension.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is i/2 times the commutator of dimensionless gammas, so σ is dimensionless.

What about F^{μν}? I think F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. The gauge field A_mu has mass dimension 1 in 4D. Because in QED, the field strength is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, which is dimension 1 (since derivatives have dimension 1) and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no: F is made from the derivatives and the gauge fields, so each term in F is like ∂ A, so F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2.

So putting it all together, the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the dimensions:

κ is the coupling we're considering, so let's compute the rest.

ψ̄ has [3/2], σ is
