Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see. The setup is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor but not at the center.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each involving different expressions, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me recall what I know about conductors and electric fields. Oh right, when a conductor is neutral and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when we place +q inside the cavity, the conductor's electrons will be attracted to the cavity's inner surface. That would leave the inner surface with a charge of -q, and since the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged, and the cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Right.

But what about the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that a spherical conductor with charge Q will have an electric field outside as if all the charge were at the center. So for a point outside, it's like you have a point charge equal to the total charge of the conductor.

In this case, the outer surface has +q, so the total charge of the conductor is +q. So the electric field outside should be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Oh, but the conductor's outer
