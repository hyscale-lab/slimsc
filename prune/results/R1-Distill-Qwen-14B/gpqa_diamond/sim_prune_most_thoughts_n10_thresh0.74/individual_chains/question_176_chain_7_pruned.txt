Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, are those the components? Because in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a column vector, so the elements are probably the components of the vector. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the components would typically be complex numbers, but here they're real. Hmm, but okay, maybe that's fine.

So, the system's state is |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1]. That's a 3-dimensional vector, so we're dealing with a 3-level system, maybe like spin-1 or something. Or perhaps just a generic 3D state.

Then, there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as square matrices. So, I need to find the probability of getting a specific outcome when measuring P first, then Q, and the outcomes are 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the question says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when Q is measured after P. Or is it the other way around? Oh, the wording is: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Oh, no, wait, no. Wait, the question is: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is first measure P, then measure Q. So, the
