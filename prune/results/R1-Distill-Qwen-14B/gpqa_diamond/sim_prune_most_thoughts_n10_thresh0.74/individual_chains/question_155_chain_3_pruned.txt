Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the uncertainty in Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the standard deviation of an observable to the expectation values.

Alright, the setup: We have these operators Px, Py, Pz. Their matrix forms are given in a basis that's the eigenvectors of Pz. So the basis vectors are |+z>, |0z>, |-z>, I think. Wait, because Pz has eigenvalues +ℏ, 0, -ℏ, right? Looking at the matrix for Pz:

First row: ℏ 0 0
Second row: 0 0 0
Third row: 0 0 -ℏ

So the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors. |+z> is (1,0,0), |0z> is (0,1,0), and |-z> is (0,0,1).

The system is in the eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ℏ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me double-check that. So the state is ψ = [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]^T.

Wait, to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz²> - <Pz>²). But since Pz is an observable, and the state is given, I need to compute the expectation values.

But wait, since the state is already given, perhaps I can compute <Pz> and <Pz²> directly.

But wait a second: the state is an eigenstate of Px, so when I measure Px, I get -ℏ. But what about Pz? The state isn't an eigenstate of Pz, so the expectation of Pz might be something else.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Compute <ψ| Pz |ψ> to get <Pz>.
2. Compute <ψ| Pz² |ψ> (since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is the same as each element squared, so maybe this is easier).
3. Then compute Δ
