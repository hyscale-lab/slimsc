Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me visualize its structure. It's a phenyl group with substituents. The ethan-1-one part means a ketone (C=O) attached to a two-carbon chain. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3?), wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone on the first carbon of ethane, so it's R-CO-CH2-. Wait, I think I might be getting confused here.

Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, no. No, ethan-1-one would be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-? Wait, no, no, I think I'm mixing up. Ethan-1-one is actually acetone, which is (propan-2-one) but perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no. Let me think again. The numbering for ethanone: ethan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon of ethane. Ethane has two carbons. So ethan-1-one would be CH2(CO)CH3? No, wait, that can't be. Wait
