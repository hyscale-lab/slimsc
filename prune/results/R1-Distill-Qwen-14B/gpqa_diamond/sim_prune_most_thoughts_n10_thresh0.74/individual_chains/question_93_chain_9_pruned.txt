Okay, so I have this qPCR question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted controls with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, RÂ² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Wait, I remember that in qPCR, the efficiency usually affects the slope. A perfect efficiency (like 100%) would give a certain slope value. I think the formula for the slope is related to efficiency. The standard formula is slope = -3.3219 / log(efficiency), but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, wait. If the efficiency is 100%, that's 1, so the slope would be zero? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is something like slope = - (log E) * (number of cycles). For a 100% efficient reaction, E is 1. So log E is 0. So the slope would be -3.3219 * 0 = 0? But wait, wait, the given slope is -3.3. Hmm, that's close to -3.3219, which is approximately the log2(10) multiplied by 3.3219. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Oh right! The slope of a qPCR calibration curve is related to the efficiency. The formula for the slope is (slope) = -3.3219 * log10(E), or maybe it's log base 2? Wait, no, the standard formula for the slope when using log10 of the concentration is: slope = - (log10(E) ) * (1 / (1 - E)). No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that for a perfectly efficient reaction (E=1), the expected slope is -3.3219. Because the formula is y = -3.3219 * log10(x) + intercept, where x is copies. So if the slope is -3.3, that's very close to the expected value for a 100% efficient reaction. So that's correct.

Now, looking at
