Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that processes some inputs and gives certain outputs. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. My task is to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to the input ACAGTGACC to get the correct output from the given options.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the examples. AGG is a DNA sequence, I think. Each letter represents a nucleotide: A, T, C, G. So the first thing I'll do is see if there's a pattern between the input strings and their outputs.

For AGG, the output is 115. Let's break down AGG. Each letter corresponds to a number. Wait, maybe each nucleotide has a numerical value, and the algorithm sums them up. Let me check the possible values for each nucleotide.

I remember that in some systems, A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Or maybe it's a different mapping. Let me think. Another possibility is using their positions in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Wait, that might not work because AGG would then be 1 + 7 +7 =15, which isn't 115. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a two-digit number, like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Let's see: For AGG, A is 10, G is 40, G is 40. Sum is 10 +40 +40=90. Not 115. Close, but no.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is multiplied by their position in the string. So for AGG, which is length 3. A is first (position 1?), so 1 * A's value. G is position 2, so 2 * G's value, and another G at position 3.

Wait, but I don't know the values yet. So let's assume each has a value. Let me assign variables. Let A = a, T = t, C = c, G = g. Then for AGG, the calculation would be a + 2g + 3g? No, wait, maybe it's a sum where each nucleotide is multiplied by its position
