Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma gamma -> e+ e-.

The question is asking what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so these are really high-energy gamma-rays.

I think I need to consider the process of pair production here. When a high-energy photon interacts with another photon, if their combined energy is enough, they can produce an electron and a positron. But wait, how does this limit the lifetime of the gamma-rays?

Oh right, the lifetime limit comes from the probability of the photon-photon interaction. If the gamma-ray is too high energy, it might annihilate quickly with CMB photons, so its lifetime in the universe would be short. The energy where this process becomes significant would be where the annihilation rate is high enough that the lifetime becomes comparable to the age of the universe or something like that.

Wait, but what's the formula here? I remember something about the cross-section for photon-photon interactions. The cross-section for pair production is probably proportional to some power of the photon energies. Or maybe it's inversely proportional to the product of their energies? Or perhaps the square of the logarithm? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependence.

Alternatively, I recall that the probability of interaction (like in the case of pair production in a medium) depends on the product of the photon energies and the density of the target photons. In this case, the target is the CMB, which has a known number density.

The cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is given by the so-called "photon-photon" cross-section. I think the cross-section sigma ~ (alpha^2)/(s) * something, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or maybe it's sigma ~ (alpha^2) * (log terms) / (s), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the cross-section for electron-positron production in gamma-gamma collisions is a well-known process. The formula I think is sigma = (4π/9) * (α^2/(s)) * (ln(s/(4 m_e^2)))^2, where m_e is the electron mass, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. But wait, that might be in the context where the two photons have comparable energies.

Alternatively, when one photon is much more energetic than the other, like in the case where the CMB photon is low energy and the gamma-ray is high energy, we can approximate the cross-section. Maybe the cross-section in the limit where one photon's energy is much larger than the other is sigma ≈ (4π/9) * (α^2) * (E_photon * n_CMB) / (E_gamma^2), where E_photon is the typical CMB photon energy, and n_CMB is the number density of CMB photons.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the interaction probability. The mean free path for the gamma-ray would be the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section times the number density of target photons.

The number density of CMB photons, n_CMB, can be calculated knowing the CMB temperature. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density is given by the photon density formula, which is n ≈ (g_{\gamma} * T^3)/(2π^2 ℏ^3 c^3)}, where g_{\gamma}=2 for photons (two polarizations). Alternatively, I've heard that the number density of CMB photons is about 411 cm^-3 or approximately 4e8 m^-3. Wait, let me calculate that properly
