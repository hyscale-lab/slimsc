Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So the question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

First, the setup: We have a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. The value of m (orbital magnetic quantum number) is small, and B is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term here) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen.

Wait, paramagnetic coupling... Oh right, that usually refers to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton times the magnetic quantum number m. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B. Oh wait, the minus sign represents the potential energy, which is lowest when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m times the Bohr magneton and the magnetic field B. Let me jot down the formula. The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the elementary charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the electron mass.

Wait, no, the Bohr magneton is (eħ)/(2m_e), but when calculating the energy, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. So for each electron, the energy shift due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. But wait, the magnetic moment μ is μ = μ_B * m, right? Because for an orbital magnetic moment, μ = m * μ_B, where m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, no. Let's be precise. The magnetic moment due to orbital motion is given by μ = (μ_B) * m, where m can be -l, ..., +l. So yes, in that case, H would be -μ·B = -μ_B * m * B. But wait, the magnetic field is along Oz, so the dot product is just B times the component of μ along Oz, which is m μ_B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is -m μ_B B. But since m is small, maybe we can approximate ⟨H⟩ as proportional to m times B.

Wait, but the problem says m is small
