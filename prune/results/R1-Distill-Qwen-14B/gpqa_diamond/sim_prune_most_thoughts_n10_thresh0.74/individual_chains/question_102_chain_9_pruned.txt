Okay, I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. Let's go through the problem step by step.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means two genes in one vector, so in this case, the ligand and receptor.

The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Then comes the receptor, which is under the IRES element and fused to eGFP, with a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, right? So the CBA promoter is driving the ligand's expression. Then the receptor is after an IRES. So IRES allows internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor is expressed as a separate transcript, right? So the vector makes two separate proteins: ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But in the vector design, there are stop cassettes in between. Oh wait, the ligand is at 5', then a stop with loxP. Then the receptor is after the IRES, which is under its own control. So when the vector is transfected into cells, if Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites. So the stop cassette would be removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be co-expressed if the lox2272 sites are recombined.

But in their experiment, they have a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, I think.

Wait, the Cre is under SOX10's regulatory elements. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, which are derived from the ectoderm, particularly in the developing embryo.

But
