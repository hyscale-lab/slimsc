Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and interactions. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, I remember that bosons are force-carrying particles, like photons or gluons, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

The problem gives a Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that. Oh right, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermions. So X is a boson field, and it's interacting with fermions ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I'm looking for the allowed decay products of X. The question is about kinematical allowance at the lowest order, which probably means tree-level decays, without considering loop corrections or higher-order effects.

In particle physics, when a boson decays, the decay products must satisfy certain conditions. The primary condition is energy and conservation laws, but also the interaction terms in the Lagrangian determine what particles can be produced.

So the first thing I should do is figure out what fermions X can interact with. The Lagrangian term probably tells me about the interaction. Let's look at the term more carefully. It's written as -λ ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe the structure is that X couples to ψ_f fermions. So the interaction term is something like X ψ_f ψ_f, which would mean that X can decay into two fermions of type ψ_f.

Wait, but what's ψ_f here? The problem says "fermions" but doesn't specify. So perhaps ψ_f is a generic fermion field, but in reality, the interaction would only occur for certain types of fermions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the fermions are all the possible ones that can interact via this term.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Standard Model. In the Standard Model, bosons like the W and Z bosons decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The decay products are determined by which fermions the boson couples to. For example, the W boson couples to left-handed fermions, so it can decay into charged lepton and neutrino pairs, or quark-antiquark pairs if the quarks are charged.

In this case, the X boson's interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So looking at the term, it seems that X couples to ψ_f. So the decay products of X would be a pair of ψ_f particles. But wait, ψ_f is a fermion, so the decay would be X → ψ_f ψ_f_bar? Or wait, the interaction term is X ψ_f ψ_f, so when X decays, it would produce two ψ_f particles. But wait, fermions have to come in pairs with opposite quantum numbers, so it would be a fermion and an antifermion.

Wait, but how does the Lag
