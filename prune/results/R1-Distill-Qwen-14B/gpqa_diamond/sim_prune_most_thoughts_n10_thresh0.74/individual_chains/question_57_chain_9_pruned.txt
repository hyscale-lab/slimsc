Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives some phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh, and the electrons are 50 MeV. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out which one is right.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has real and imaginary parts. For elastic scattering, the imaginary part is related to the phase shifts. Oh right! The general formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ,φ) = sum over l of ( (2l+1) / (2l+1) ) * e^{iδ_l} * [ e^{-iδ_l} - 1 ] * ... Wait, no, maybe I should think about the partial wave expansion. 

Oh wait, the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} / (something). Hmm, but wait, the exact formula is a bit hazy for me. Let me think. I think the amplitude can be written as f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) / (2l + 1) ) * e^{i δ_l} * [ e^{-i δ_l} - 1 ] * something. Or maybe it's (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) / (something with k and r0 or something). Wait, perhaps the formula is f(l,θ) = (2l + 1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ). But I'm not sure about the denominator or if there's a 1/(k a) factor or something like that. 

Wait, another approach: The scattering amplitude is often written in terms of the partial waves. The imaginary part of the amplitude along the incident direction, which would be θ=0. Because along the incident beam, the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. Or wait, actually, if the beam is along the z-axis, then the direction of the amplitude's imaginary part would be along that axis, so θ=0. Because the amplitude is a function of angle, and the question specifies "along the incident beam direction," which I think refers to θ=0. But wait, the question says "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." Hmm, maybe it's the imaginary part in the forward direction, so θ=0.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. In partial wave terms, the imaginary part is linked to the phase shifts. But I'm trying to recall the exact expression.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ,φ) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} / (something). Wait, I think the denominator is (k a)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (something else).

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f can be written as f = sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}. But I'm not certain about the e^{i l φ} part. Because for each partial wave l, the angular dependence is in terms of P_l and e^{i l φ}. But when θ is 0, P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)=1, etc. So for θ=0, all P_l(1)=1.

So for the forward direction (θ=0), the amplitude becomes sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] e^{i l φ}.

But the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Wait, but for the forward direction (θ=0), the scattering amplitude's real and imaginary parts are given by the sum. So the imaginary part would be the imaginary component of this sum.

Wait, but the phase shifts given are up to l=4. So the sum would be from l=0 to l=4.

So the amplitude f = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] e^{i l φ}.

But since the question is about the imaginary part, perhaps we can compute the imaginary part of this sum.

But then, how do the phase shifts come into play? Each term in the sum has e^{2i δ_l}, which can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l).

So [e^{2i δ_l} -1] = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

Thus, each term (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] e^{i l φ} becomes (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] [ cos(l φ) + i sin(l φ) ].

Multiplying this out, we can separate into real and imaginary parts.

But since the question is about the imaginary part, let's focus on that.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) sin(l φ) + sin(2δ_l) cos(l φ) ) ].

Wait, because for a product (a + ib)(c + id), the imaginary part is a*d + b*c.

So [ (cos(2δ) -1) + i sin(2δ) ] * [ cos(lφ) + i sin(lφ) ].

The product's imaginary part is (cos(2δ) -1) * sin(lφ) + sin(2δ) * cos(lφ).

So summing over all l, the imaginary part of f(θ=0, φ) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) sin(lφ) + sin(2δ_l) cos(lφ) ].

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. But what about φ? The scattering is in all directions, but along the beam, φ=0 perhaps? Or maybe we're considering the total cross-section, which integrates over all solid angles. Hmm, no, the question specifically mentions the imaginary part 'along' the incident direction, so I think that refers to θ=0, φ=0. Because along the beam direction, the angle is 0, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 as well.

Wait, but the amplitude f is a function of both θ and φ, so when calculating the imaginary part at θ=0 and φ=0, we can substitute those angles into the expression.

So substituting θ=0 and φ=0 into the expression for the imaginary part.

At φ=0, cos(lφ)=1 and sin(lφ)=0.

So each term (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) * 0 + sin(2δ_l) * 1 ].

So the imaginary part becomes sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l).

Wait, that seems manageable.

So the imaginary part Im f is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let's check that. For each l, sin(2δ_l).

So let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1)=1. δ₀=90°, sin(2*90)=sin(180)=0. So term is 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: (2*1+1)=3. δ₁=67°, so 2δ=134°. sin(134) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)= approx 0.7193. So 3*0.7193 ≈ 2.1578.

l=2: (5). δ₂=55°, 2δ=110°. sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397. So 5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: (7). δ₃=30°, 2δ=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. 7 * 0.866 ≈6.062.

l=4: (9). δ₄=13°, 2δ=26°. sin(26)≈0.4384. 9 * 0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: ~2.1578.

l=2: ~4.6985.

l=3: ~6.062.

l=4: ~3.9456.

Total Im f = 0 + 2.1578 + 4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = let's compute:

2.1578 +4.6985 = 6.8563.

6.8563 +6.062 = 12.9183.

12.9183 +3.9456=16.8639.

So sum is approximately 16.8639.

Wait, but I think I may be missing a factor here. Because the scattering amplitude f has units of inverse length (like inverse femtometers), but the question gives the options in femtometers. So I think the expression for Im f might have some scaling factor.

Wait, another point: The phase shifts are given in degrees, but in the formula, they should be in radians, right? Because in the formula, we have sin(2δ_l), which is a trigonometric function expecting radians. So I need to convert the phase shifts from degrees to radians before applying the sine function.

Ah, right! So that's a crucial mistake I almost made. Each δ_l is in degrees, so when calculating 2δ_l, I have to convert to radians.

So let me correct that.

Compute each sin(2δ_l):

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0. So 1 * 0 = 0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°. Converting 134 degrees to radians: 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.341 radians. sin(2.341) ≈ sin(134°) ≈ 0.6691. Wait, wait wait, wait a second. Wait, earlier I thought sin(134) was sin(46)=0.7193, but wait, 134 degrees is in the second quadrant. So sin(134) is sin(180-46)=sin(46) which is approximately 0.7193. Wait, but 134 degrees is 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.340 radians. But when I compute sin(2.340), it should be correct.

Wait, let me compute sin(134 degrees) properly. Another approach: 134 degrees is 90 +44 degrees. So sin(134) = sin(90+44) = cos(44) ≈
