Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the setup is that there's a star with a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. There's a planet (let's call it Planet A) with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, Planet B, with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits. We need to find the maximum orbital period of Planet B such that it also transits and is occulted.

Wait, transit and occultation events. Oh right, a transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, leading to a decrease in the total observed brightness. So both events are observable only if the orbital plane is edge-on enough for transits and the planet is within the star's light disc for occultation.

Hmm, but how do the orbital periods relate to these events? Oh wait, I think it's about their orbital distances. Because for a transit to happen, the planet must be at the right distance so that its orbital path crosses our line of sight to the star. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, which depends on its distance from the star compared to the star's size.

Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is behind the star relative to us. So the planet's orbital distance must be such that when it's in that position, it's behind the star. But perhaps the key here is the orbital period and their orbital distances because the maximum period would relate to the maximum distance possible where both events can still occur.

Wait, but how are the orbital periods connected to the distance? Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The orbital period depends on the distance from the star and the star's mass.

Right, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (for a circular orbit, that's the radius) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, the star's mass here is a bit tricky since it's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Oh, wait no— the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. The mass isn't given. Hmm, but wait, does the mass matter here? Because the problem doesn't state it. Hmm, perhaps I can assume the star's mass is similar to the Sun? Or is there another way around this?

Wait, maybe I don't need the mass because the question is about the ratio of the periods. Let me think. The first planet has a period of 3 days. Its radius is Earth's radius, so 1 R_earth. The second planet is 2.5 R_earth. But I'm not sure if their radii matter here. Because for transit, the planet must pass in front of the star, but I think the period relates more to orbital distance.

Wait, but wait a second. For a planet to transit, the orbital distance must be such that the planet's orbital path (as seen from Earth) passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is given as 0.2 for Planet A. Impact parameter is the distance, in units of the star's radius, from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path during transit. So for Planet A, the impact parameter is 0.2 times the star's radius.

So, the impact parameter 'b' is related to the orbital distance of the planet and the inclination of the orbit. The formula for impact parameter is b = a * sin(i), where 'a' is the semi-major axis (orbital radius), and 'i' is the inclination. For a transiting planet, i is close to 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin(i) is approximately 1. But sometimes it's not exactly 90, leading to a non-zero impact parameter.

Wait, but wait. Impact parameter is the perpendicular distance from the center of the star to the planet's path. So it's a function of the planet's orbital radius and the inclination. So, for a circular orbit, the planet's path around the star is a circle. When the planet transits, the path comes closest to the star's center at a distance equal to the impact parameter. So, the impact parameter relates to the planet's orbital radius and the inclination.

So, if a planet has a semi-major axis 'a', then the distance from the star's center during transit (the closest point) is b = a * sin(i). But wait, no— the planet's orbital radius is 'a', and the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path. So if the orbit is
