Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The scenario is that these spots cause brightness variations because the star rotates, modulating our view of them. The setup is that this could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The question is, if there were no spots, what would the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet need to be to produce the same brightness variation?

Hmm. So the key point is comparing the photometric signal amplitude from the planet transit to the signal from the spots.

First, I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to (R_p/R_s)^2. But wait, wait, that's only if the star's entire surface emits uniformly. But in this case, the star has spots, so the brightness change isn't the same as a uniform surface.

Let me think. The star has spots that are cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere has spots, the brightness variation would depend on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots and their temperature.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%—so the spots cover 0.2 of the hemisphere. So each hemisphere is half of the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) )? Or wait, maybe the filling factor (f) is 20% of the hemisphere. So the total area of spots is f * (π R^2 / 2) ) = 0.2 * (π R^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 π R^2.

The star's total area is π R^2, so the spots are 0.1 of the total area, but wait, because the spots are on one hemisphere only. So when part of the hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less total flux.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler—so 5000 K.

The flux from the star without spots would be F = σ T_eff^4. But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less flux. So the total flux when the spots are fully visible (i.e., when the spotty hemisphere is the one facing us) would be lower.

Let me model this. The star's total flux when no spots are visible is F0 = σ * (6000)^4. When the spotty side is visible, the total flux F = (1 - f) * F0 * (1) + f * F0_spot, where F0_spot is the flux per unit area of the spots.

Wait, actually, the star's surface without spots emits F0 = σ T^4, and the spots emit F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4. So the total flux when spots are on the side we see is:

F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot

Since T_spot = 5000 K, F_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * F0.

So F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * (5000/6000)^4 * F0.

The fractional change in flux would be (F - F0) / F0 = [ (1 - f) + f*(5000/6000)^4 ] -1.

Wait, no. Let's compute F as F0*(1 - f) + f* (F_spot / F0), because F0 is the flux per unit area without spots.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the star's total flux. Without spots, the flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * A, where A is the total surface area (4π R^2). When spots are present, the flux is F = (A - A_spots) * σ T_eff^4 + A_spots * σ T_spot^4.

So A_spots is 0.2 * (2π R^2), because the spots are on one hemisphere. Wait, one hemisphere is half the surface. So hemisphere area is 2π R². Filling factor is 20%, so A_spots = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F = (4π R² - 0.4 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

Simplify:

F = (3.6 π R²) σ (6000^4) + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000^4).

The original flux without spots is F0 = 4 π R² σ (6000^4).

So the change in flux is F - F0 = [3.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ] - 4 *6000^4 ] * π R² σ.

Factor out 4 *6000^4:

F - F0 = [3.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 * (1/4)] *4 π R² σ (6000^4) ?

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute 3.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4*(5000)^4.

Wait, let's compute the term inside the brackets:

Term = 3.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4) - 4*(6000^4)

= (3.6 -4) *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4

= (-0.4 *6000^4 ) + 0.4 *5000^4 

= 0.4 [ (-6000^4) +5000^4 ]

Compute 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = 5^4 *1e12 =625e12.

So term = 0.4 [ -1296e12 + 625e12 ] = 0.4 [ (-671e12) ] = 0.4 * (-6.71e14) ?

Wait, 6000^4 is 6^4=1296, so 6000^4=1296e12.

Similarly, 5000^4= 625e12.

So 1296e12 -625e12 = 671e12.

But in our case, it's (-6000^4 +5000^4) = (-1296e12 +625e12 )= (-671e12).

So term = 0.4 * (-671e12) = -268.4e12.

So F - F0 = ( -268.4e12 ) * π R² σ.

Wait, but the total F0 is 4 *6000^4 π R² σ = 4 *1296e12 * π R² σ = 5184e12 π R² σ.

Wait, wait, the flux change is (F - F0) = (-268.4e12) * π R² σ.

But the question is about the photometric variation. So the fractional change when the spots are on the visible side is (F - F0)/F0.

Which is [ (-268.4e12 π R² σ ) ] / [5184e12 π R² σ ] 

Simplify:

= (-268.4) / 5184 ≈ -0.0517.

So the fractional change is about -5.17% when the spots are fully visible.

Wait, but that's the minimum flux. When the spots are not visible (the other hemisphere), the flux is F0. So the maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F as calculated. So the variation is about 5.17% drop.

But wait, how about the amplitude of the variation? The variation would be (F_max - F_min)/F0
