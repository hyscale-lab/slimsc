Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what I can understand.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are involved in various reactions, and I need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let's break it down.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, the reaction might look like A1 → A2 + F2. The oF (which I think is the ortho-percentage, maybe the percentage of deuterium in some context, but more likely it's the oxygen or fluorine isotope abundance? Wait, no, perhaps it's the ortho content? Or maybe it's the degree of fluorination. Hmm. Wait, the question says ɷF=31.96%. Wait, 31.96% is close to the natural abundance of fluorine-19, which is about 100% because fluorine is almost all F-19. Wait, no—wait, natural abundance: F-19 is about 100% because the stable isotopes of fluorine are F-19 (about 100% naturally?), wait no, wait, fluorine has isotopes F-19 (about 100% abundance?), but actually, let me think: the atomic weight of fluorine is around 19, so maybe F-19 is the main isotope, but that's besides the point.

Wait, perhaps the 31.96% refers to the molar mass of fluorine? Because 31.96 is close to the atomic weight of F, which is about 19. Wait, that doesn't add up. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. So maybe A2 is a compound where F has a certain percentage. Let me hold that thought.

Next, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but maybe A1 is a compound that's even more so. So perhaps A1 is a fluoride that's a strong oxidizer. Wait, but fluorine itself is a diatomic molecule, F2. So maybe A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF3 or something? Or perhaps it's a perfluoride, like YF4?

Wait, but the problem says these are binary compounds, so each is Y and F. So possible compounds could be YF2, YF3, YF4, etc. But since there are five, that suggests Y is a group 1 or 2 element, but maybe not. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in the third period, as it forms multiple fluorides.

Wait, moving on. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine. So A3 is a binary compound, YF something. So perhaps A3 is YF2, but I'm not sure.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio
