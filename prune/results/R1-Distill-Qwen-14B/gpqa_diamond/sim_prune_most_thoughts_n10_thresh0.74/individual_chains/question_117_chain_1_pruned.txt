Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, which means they're not superimposable on their mirror images. Alternatively, meso compounds can't have optical isomerism because they have an internal plane of symmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the structure has a biphenyl group with substituents on each ring. The substituents are at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, biphenyls can have different configurations based on the rotation around the central bond. Are there any chiral centers here? Let me think. The substituents are on carbons that are attached to the benzene rings. Each substituent is a -OOCR group (since it's a carboxylate ester). Are those substituents in positions that could make the molecule chiral?

Wait, for a biphenyl to have stereoisomerism, the substituents should be in such a way that the rotation creates different configurations. But if the substituents are in para positions (since 2 and 6 are opposite on the benzene ring), would that allow for cis or trans configurations? Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a situation where the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on both sides are mirror images, then maybe not. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that a mirror plane doesn't exist, then it would have optical isomers.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The biphenyl has two substituents on each ring. The positions are 2 and 2', which are adjacent on each ring. Wait, 1,1'-biphenyl means the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position of each. So positions 2 and 2' are on the adjacent carbon of each benzene ring. So, for the substituents at 2,2': each has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester group? Or wait, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro... So for each ring, positions 6 have nitro groups, and positions 2 have the ester groups.

Wait, perhaps each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester group at position 2. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). But since benzene is symmetric, the 2 and 6 positions are equivalent in terms of symmetry. Hmm.

Would this create a situation where the molecule is chiral? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry, then it can have optical isomers. So maybe this compound does show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The
