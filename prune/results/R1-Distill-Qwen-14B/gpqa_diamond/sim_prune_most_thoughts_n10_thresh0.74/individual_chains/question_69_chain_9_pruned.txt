Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰.

Alright, so the decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different resolutions, measured in meters, so I'm guessing the question is about the spatial resolution needed in the detector.

Wait, when they talk about the minimum resolution, I think they're referring to the minimum uncertainty in measuring the decay position. Because if the decay doesn't happen right where you detect it, you have to be able to resolve the point where it decayed. So, the resolution must be less than the length the particle travels before decaying, right?

Oh right, that's the concept of the proper lifetime versus the observed lifetime due to time dilation. The particle is moving at relativistic speeds, so its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than τ₀. The length it travels before decaying is then gamma multiplied by c times tau.

But wait, the lifetime dilation formula is τ = γ * τ₀. So the distance L is γ * c * τ₀. That would be the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying. So, to observe the decay, the detector must have a resolution good enough to spot the decay point within that length. So, the minimum resolution needed is probably on the order of that distance L.

But wait, the problem says "at least 30% of the decays." That suggests that a certain fraction of the decays are within a certain range. Oh, perhaps it's about the mean decay length. Or maybe it's about the uncertainty in measuring the decay point.

Wait, another approach. The detector has a certain resolution, say Δx. To observe a decay, the particle must decay within a region that the detector can resolve. So if the particle's lifetime is such that it's moving a certain distance, the detector's resolution must be smaller than that distance so that any decay within that area can be detected.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So perhaps we're looking
