Okay, so I've got this problem about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than tr. So tr is the time when the field was generated, meaning the charge's position at that time affects the field at time t.

The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So d = r - s(tr), I think. Right, because the field at r would depend on where the charge was earlier.

The velocity at the generating instant tr is v. So v is the velocity vector of the charge when the field was created. 

Now, the potentials are V and A. I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, relativistic effects might come into play, or maybe it's about how the potentials are retarded.

Wait, the scalar potential V for a moving charge. In the static case, V is q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, I think there's a correction due to the motion. Or wait, does the scalar potential include any time dependence?

Wait, no. Wait, in the static case, it's just Coulomb's potential. But when the charge is moving, the potentials become functions that depend on the charge's velocity. Hmm.

I remember that the vector potential A is related to the motion of the charge. For a steady current, A is something like (μ0 I)/(4π) times the path integral or something. But for a point charge moving, it's probably more involved.

Wait, the general expressions for potentials in the case of a moving charge. Oh right, the scalar potential V is the same as Coulomb's law, but evaluated at the retarded position. Wait, but no, wait. Or is that a different approach?

Wait, no, I think for a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials have terms involving the velocity. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. Oh right! The Liénard equations give expressions for the potentials of an accelerated charge.

So the scalar potential V is given by V = (q/(4πε0)) * (1/(r - (v t)/c²)) ), but wait, that's in the case where the charge is at the origin and moving with velocity v. But in our case, the charge's position at tr was s(tr), so the vector d is r - s(tr). Wait, but in the expression, I think there's a term involving the dot product of d and v.

Wait, let's think about the retarded time. The retarded time tr is such that the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the field point r is the time delay. So the charge's position at tr is s(tr), and the field at r is affected by the charge's state at tr.

So for V, the scalar potential, the expression I think is V(r,t) = q/(4πε0) * 1/(d - (v t_r)/c²), where d is the distance between r and s(tr). Wait, but actually, the denominator might involve the term (d c - v · d) or something similar because of the time delay.

Wait, the denominator for the scalar potential is often written as (r - (v/c²) * (r - s(tr)) )) ? Hmm, not exactly sure. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, the scalar potential due to a moving charge can be written as V = (q/(4πε0)) [1/(r - (v t_r)/c²)] but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's [1/(d - (v (t - tr))/c²)].

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential is given by V(r,t) = (q/(4πε0)) * 1/(r - (v t_r)/
