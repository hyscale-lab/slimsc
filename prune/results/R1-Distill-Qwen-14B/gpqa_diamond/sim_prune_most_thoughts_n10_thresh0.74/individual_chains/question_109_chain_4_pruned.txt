Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. So, the initial state is 1S0, which I think means the spin is S=0 because the notation is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So for 1S0, 2S+1=1 implies S=0, L would be S, and J=0. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the letters. Let me get this straight.

So the initial state is 1S0. That would mean S is 0, L is 0 (because S stands for the orbital angular momentum in letters like S, P, D...), and J is 0. Because 1S0 implies S=0, L=0, J=0? Or wait, maybe the letters are for the orbital angular momentum. Oh yeah, the letters correspond to L values: S=0, P=1, D=2, etc. So 1S0 would have L=0, S=0, so J is 0 because J = L + S.

Now, the system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is negative. I remember that parity is a quantum number, and for orbital angular momentum L, the parity is (-1)^L. So the parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. But wait, what about the parity of the entire process? Because the initial state has some parity, and the final state has to have the same parity, considering the parity of the emitted particle.

Wait, the problem says to make use of conservation of angular momentum and parity. So I have to consider both. Also, Pauli statistics require that for identical particles, their total wavefunction must be symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on their spin. But here, the question is about the NN state after emission, and the Pauli condition relates the isospin, angular momentum, and spin in some way.

Wait the problem statement says: Pauli statistics require
