Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the problem involves a wave function and normalization, I think. I remember that wave functions need to be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. 

The setup is an ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but when we measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but the given expression is valid in the region where the particle exists—so it's non-zero between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 +x)) -0.5i. Wait, that seems complex. So the wave function ψ(x) is a complex function. But for the probability density, we usually take the square of the absolute value, |ψ(x)|². 

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is 0.5. So the absolute square would be A² + B², because (a - ib)(a* + ib) = a² + b². Oh wait, no, wait: (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b². So yeah, the square of the absolute value is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2.

But wait, am I getting this right? Because the wave function being ψ(x) = A - Bi, so |ψ|² = (A^2 + B^2 ). Oh wait, no, because ψ is a complex number ψ = a real part + i times imaginary part. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - i*(0.5), so the imaginary part is -0.5. So the absolute square is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. That's the probability density.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 equals 1. Because all
