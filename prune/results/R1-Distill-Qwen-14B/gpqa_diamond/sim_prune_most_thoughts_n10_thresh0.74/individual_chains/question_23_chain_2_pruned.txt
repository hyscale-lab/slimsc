Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read through it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot was smaller, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the products is correct from the options given.

Hmm. Let me break this down. The starting material is an ether, right? The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group: 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is like O-benzene connected to a CH₂-C(CH3)₂-CH₂-CH₂ group but with a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. Let me draw it out.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, numbering starts from the end where the substituent is attached. So the structure is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond starting from the first carbon? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- attached to the oxygen. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as but-3-en-1-yl: the position of the substituent. So, the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, but that can't be because butenyl has four carbons, so maybe the double bond is between 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH₂)₂C(CH3)₂-CH₂-O-benzene? No, wait, no. Let me think again. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So butenyl is four carbons. The substituent is a but-3-en-1-yl group. So the structure is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but that would be a terminal double bond, but I think I might have the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, no, perhaps I should write the structure. Let me number the butenyl chain from the point where it's attached to the oxygen. So, the first carbon is attached to the oxygen, then the next ones.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is:

CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond between carbon
