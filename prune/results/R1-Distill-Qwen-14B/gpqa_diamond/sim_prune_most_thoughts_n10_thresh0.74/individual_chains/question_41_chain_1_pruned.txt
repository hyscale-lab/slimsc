Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, right. So the glass is moving towards the observer, right? And the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, maybe I should parse that again.

The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh, no, wait. Because the beam is moving toward the observer, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

Wait a minute, but the glass is a medium through which the light is propagating. So the light is inside the glass, which is itself moving. So we're to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But here, the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait
