Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system consisting of a charge q placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves the interaction between charges, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

So the setup is: a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy U of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the concepts step by step.

First, I recall that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons as needed. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges will reside on the surface. The method of images might come into play here. Oh wait, method of images is used in electrostatics to find the potential due to a charge near a conductor by considering image charges.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface must be zero. That's an important point. Because the sphere is a conductor, the electric field inside it is zero, and the charges rearrange themselves on the surface.

So, the initial setup is a point charge q at a distance d from the center. The sphere, being grounded, will have induced charges. Let me think about the image charge approach. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge method says that the sphere can be treated as having an image charge inside it, but I'm not exactly sure how this applies when the sphere is grounded.

Wait, the image charge method usually applies when the conductor is isolated. But here, the sphere is grounded, so perhaps the image charge is adjusted accordingly. Or maybe the presence of the grounded sphere changes the potential energy in a way that involves self-energy and interaction energy.

Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the self-energy and the interaction energies. But in this case, we have a charge and a conductor. The conductor's charges are induced, so maybe I should consider the work done in bringing the charge q near the sphere, which would involve the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So when you bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, you're doing work against the electric field created by
