Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's start by understanding the question. 

So, the problem says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. The main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Each of these contributes differently to the neutrino flux we detect on Earth.

Wait, right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the others. Because in the pp-III process, there's a more energetic stage, like when a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a boron-8 isotope, which then decays into lithium-7 and emits a positron and a neutrino. These neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy, around 15-20 MeV, I think. 

But the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Wait, those are lower energies than the typical pp-III neutrinos. So I'm a bit confused because I thought the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp-I chain, which produces lower energy neutrinos (like around 0.5 MeV, so 500 keV is about that range). Oh wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, so that's in the range of the lower-energy neutrinos, but I might be mixing up things.

Wait, no, the pp-I chain produces neutrinos in the ~0.5 MeV range. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher. So if the pp-III stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

But wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies, so their flux is higher in higher energy bands. But the question is about bands around 0.7-0.9 MeV, which is probably dominated by the pp-I branch. 

Wait, but in the initial state, the Sun is producing neutrinos from all branches. If the pp-III suddenly stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in these bands?

Wait, but neutrinos take time to reach Earth. Since the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes
