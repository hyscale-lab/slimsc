Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, not super familiar with all the relativistic formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the second has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed... That's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Oh right, because in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract their speeds as you would in classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically.

The formula for relative velocity, if I recall correctly, is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So that's when v1 and v2 are the speeds of two objects in the same direction. Let me plug in the values.

So here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, does it matter which is which? Well, the relative speed would depend on which one is considered the frame of reference. So if I'm astronaut A, I'm moving at 0.6c, and I see astronaut B moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The formula for the velocity of object B as seen from object A's frame is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)). Or is it (v_A - v_B)/(1 - ...)? Hmm, I think I might have mixed up the order. Let me think again. If object B is moving at v_B in the lab frame, and object A is moving at v_A, then from A's perspective, B's speed is (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, but since both are moving in the same direction, using A's frame, B is actually approaching at a
