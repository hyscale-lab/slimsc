Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, the anti-nutritional compound is likely being produced because the gene is functional. So we want a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. That would probably be a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, in the first exon. So the mutations are in the coding region of the first exon. So any mutation that changes the amino acid sequence could potentially disrupt the gene's function.

I remember that in mRNA, the sequence is translated into proteins. So any change in the DNA that leads to an amino acid change could cause a nonfunctional protein, leading to the compound not being made.

But wait, I should look at each mutant's changes.

The intact gene is shown as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me write it out in parts to see the changes.

Looking at Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Compare to intact, which is:
ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT

So, the first few bases: 
Intact: ATGTTTCTC...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTAC...
Wait, first part. The first few codons: Let me break it down.

Intact:
First codon: ATG (start)
Second: TTT (Phe)
Third: CTC (Leu)
Fourth: GCT (Ala)
Wait, no—wait, the DNA is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be complementary. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the DNA sequence given is the coding strand, which is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So the mRNA would be the same as the DNA
