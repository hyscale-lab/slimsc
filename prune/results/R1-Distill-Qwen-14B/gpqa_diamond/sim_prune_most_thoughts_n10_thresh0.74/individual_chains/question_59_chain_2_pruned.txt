Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some pH values.

Wait, so I'm mixing a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should first figure out the moles of each acid and base, then see if there's excess acid or base left after neutralization.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

First, CH3COOH. It's 0.1 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl is 0.2 M in 400 mL. So 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M in 300 mL. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, let me check that again. The volume is 0.3 liters, right? So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH- so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, when you mix acids and bases, the H+ from acids reacts with OH- from bases. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate, releasing 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but initially, we can consider it as providing 0.05 moles of H+ (but perhaps that's an over-simplification; I'll have to think about that).

Wait, but when dealing with neutralization, I should consider all the H+ and OH- sources. Since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will be available. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate, but in this case, since we have a lot of OH- from the Ba(OH)2, maybe the CH3COOH's H+ will be dissociated more. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat the weak acid as a source of H+ in solution, but in the presence of excess OH-, it could be neutralized.

Wait, maybe the approach is to compute the total H+ and
