Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about electrons and positrons colliding and producing photons. I remember that when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce photons. So, the setup is an electron moving from the left and a positron moving from the right. Both are moving along the horizontal axis, which I'll assume is the x-axis.

The Lorentz factors are given: the electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2. Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so higher gamma means higher velocity. So the electron is moving faster than the positron.

After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, which is an important point. Also, their directions are measured: one is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two photons.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with conservation laws—specifically, conservation of momentum and energy. Since the annihilation produces photons, which are massless particles, their momentum is all in the direction of motion, and their energy relates to the frequency or wavelength of the photons.

Wait, so let's think about the setup before collision. The electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron from the right towards the left. So they're moving towards each other. Oh wait, the question says the positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So positron is moving to the left, perhaps? Or is it moving to the right? Wait, no, the electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis, and the positron is moving along the same axis but from the right (so towards the left? Or towards the right? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

The question says: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and a positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So the positron is moving towards the left. So their directions are opposite. So before collision, the electron is moving right, the positron left. So they're approaching each other. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but I should calculate the total momentum before the collision to apply conservation. Since the system's total momentum is
