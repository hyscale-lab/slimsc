Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it carefully again.

The problem is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two particles of types A⁺ and two of A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV/c². The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with different velocities.

Hmm, annihilation processes usually involve converting matter and antimatter into other particles, and energy is conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but wait—the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So maybe its speed is low, which implies that its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass.

Wait, but in particle physics, rest mass energy is mc². For a proton, the rest mass is about 938 MeV/c². So the antiproton has the same mass as the proton. So when it's moving slowly, perhaps its velocity is much less than the speed of light, so relativistic effects aren't too significant. Or maybe not? I'm not sure.

Let me think about the process. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since they are annihilating, they must be converting their rest mass into other particles. In this case, two A⁺ and two A⁻. So the products are four particles in total: two positive and two negative A particles.

Wait, but the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The proton has charge +e, the antiproton has charge -e. So combining them, the total charge is zero. The products are 2A⁺ and 2A⁻, which also sum to zero charge. So charge is conserved here.

But the main thing is energy and momentum conservation. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can make some approximations. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. I'm not sure what that implies. If it's moving slowly, maybe we can treat it non-relativistically? Or perhaps we need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum in a more precise way.

Wait, in the annihilation process, the initial system is the proton and the antiproton. The proton is presumably at rest if the antiproton
