Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxN. For C8H9NO, the degree of unsaturation would be:

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2n + 2 - m - x)/2
Wait, no, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh right, because each X (like O or N) affects it. So for each O, it's like subtracting 2 hydrogens, and each N, subtracting 1 hydrogen. Wait no, perhaps it's better to think:

The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The degree of unsaturation (or rings + double bonds) is calculated as:

DOU = (2 + 2C - H - X + N)/2. Where X is the number of halogens, but in this case, there are none. So X is 0. So for C8H9NO:

DOU = (2 + 2*8 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (2 +16 -9 +1)/2 â†’ (10)/2 = 5.

So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Like maybe two rings and a double bond, or four rings? No, four rings seems unlikely. Maybe three rings or some combination. Wait, a benzene ring is three degrees (three double bonds each contribute one, so benzene is 4 DOU? Wait, benzene is a ring plus three double bonds, so that's 4 DOU. Wait, no: a benzene ring is one ring (1 DOU) plus three double bonds (each 1 DOU, so 3), making total 4. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring and some other structures.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me interpret each peak.

The 9.72 ppm triplet (t) is likely an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but here it's a triplet, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, it might be an alpha proton to a carbonyl group. Wait, but aldehyde is more likely.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 regions are typical for aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a doublet (d) integrating for 2H, and 6.51 is also a doublet (d) for 2H. That suggests two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted.

So perhaps there's a benzene ring
