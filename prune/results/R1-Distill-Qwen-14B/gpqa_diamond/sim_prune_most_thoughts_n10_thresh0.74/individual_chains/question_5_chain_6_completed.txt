Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

First, let me parse the given information. The operator P is a vector operator, so it has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The components are given as:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Wait, so each component is a 2x2 matrix scaled by ħ/2. That makes sense, since in quantum mechanics, spin operators for spin-1/2 particles (like a muon) are usually represented this way.

The operator we're interested in is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane. That means it can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a direction, the components should satisfy n_x² + n_z² = 1.

The operator in the direction of n would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, no, because each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So actually, P·n is (n_x Px + n_z Pz) multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me write that correctly. Let's denote the operator as P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But each of Px and Pz is already multiplied by ħ/2. So,

P·n = ħ/2 (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

So, the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Because adding the matrices:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]
So adding them gives [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So the matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by that.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The general approach for finding eigenvectors is to solve (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0.

Here, λ is the eigenvalue, which is +ħ/2.

So the matrix (P·n - λ I) would be:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] - (ħ/2) * I

Which is (ħ/2) times [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ].

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (λ I) is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]]. So subtracting that from P·n:

Matrix = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] - (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,1]]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Now, the eigenvector equation is this matrix multiplied by the vector [a, b]^T equals zero.

So,

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] * [a; b] = 0.

Since ħ/2 is a scalar, it can be factored out, so the equation reduces to:

[ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ] * [a; b] = 0.

So, the system of equations is:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0   ...(1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0  ...(2)

We can write equation (1) as:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

But wait, we can solve either equation for a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's pick equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Let me simplify that denominator. The denominator is (n_z -1), but perhaps it's easier to write it as -(1 - n_z), so a = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b.

Now, let's substitute this into equation (2):

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Substitute a:

n_x [ (n_x)/(1 - n_z) ) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ n_x² / (1 - n_z) + (-n_z -1) ] b =0

Since b isn't necessarily zero (and a eigenvector can't be zero), the expression in brackets must be zero.

So,

n_x²/(1 - n_z) + (-n_z -1) =0

Multiply both sides by (1 - n_z):

n_x² + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) =0

Let's compute (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z):

= (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z² -1 +n_z
Simplify:
-n_z +n_z = 0
So, n_z² -1.

So, the equation becomes:

n_x² + (n_z² -1) =0 → n_x² +n_z² =1

But wait, that's the condition that n is a unit vector, since n_x² +n_z² =1. So the equation is satisfied by the given condition.

That suggests that the two equations are dependent, so any a and b that satisfy equation (1) will satisfy equation (2). So, we can choose b as a parameter, say b =1, and find a.

So, a = [n_x / (1 -n_z)] * b.

So, the eigenvector would be proportional to [n_x, (1 - n_z)]^T.

Wait, let me see: since a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b, if I take b= (1 -n_z), then a would be n_x. But perhaps it's better to write it as [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T multiplied by some normalization factor.

Wait, but wait: Let me check the calculation again. From equation (1):

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b = [n_x/(1 - n_z)] b.

So, the eigenvector can be written as [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T multiplied by a normalization constant. Because if I set b = (1 -n_z), then a would be n_x.

Alternatively, the eigenvector can be written as (n_x, 1 -n_z).

Wait, but I should check this. Let's substitute a = n_x and b = (1 -n_z) into equation (1):

(n_z -1) a +n_x b → (n_z -1) n_x +n_x (1 -n_z) 

= n_x (n_z -1 +1 -n_z ) = 0 → yes, that works.

So the vector is [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T times any scalar. But we need to normalize it.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually taken as unit vectors. So I'll need to compute the normalization factor.

So the components are a =n_x, b= (1 -n_z).

Wait, no, wait: a =n_x, because a = [n_x/(1-n_z)] * b. Let me choose b = (1 -n_z), so a =n_x.

So the vector is [n_x, (1 -n_z)]^T.

The norm squared is |n_x|^2 + |1 -n_z|^2. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1.

So,

|n_x|^2 + |1 -n_z|^2 = n_x^2 + (1 -n_z)^2.

Expanding (1 -n_z)^2 =1 -2 n_z +n_z^2.

So,

n_x^2 +1 -2 n_z +n_z^2 = (n_x^2 +n_z^2) +1 -2 n_z = 1 +1 -2 n_z → 2(1 -n_z).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Wait, but wait, n_z could be less than 1, so 1 -n_z is positive.

So the normalized eigenvector would be:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/ sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ) ]^T.

Simplify each component:

= [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]^T.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of angles.

Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, we can represent it using an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Because in spherical coordinates, for a direction in the x-z plane (so φ=0 or π), the components would be:

n_x = sinθ * cosφ → but since φ=0, cosφ=1, so n_x=sinθ.

n_z= cosθ.

So substituting:

n_x = sinθ,

n_z = cosθ.

So the components of the eigenvector become:

a = sinθ,

b = 1 - cosθ.

Wait, but let's compute (1 - cosθ). 1 - cosθ is 2 sin^2(θ/2) using the double-angle identity. Because cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2). So,

1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting these into a and b:

a = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2),

b = 2 sin²(θ/2).

The normalization factor is sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sqrt(2*(1 - cosθ)) = sqrt(2*2 sin^2(theta/2)) )= sqrt(4 sin^2(theta/2)) )= 2 |sin(theta/2)|.

Assuming theta is between 0 and π, sin(theta/2) is positive, so the normalization factor is 2 sin(theta/2).

So the normalized vector is:

(a, b) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / (2 sin(theta/2))

Simplify each component:

a: [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2)] = cos(theta/2)

b: [2 sin^2(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2)] = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the direction n, the eigenvector in the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, wait, this seems to be the case only when the direction is in the x-z plane. Because theta is measured from the z-axis.

So, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I've derived.

But wait, the options include some other options. Let's look:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ) → seems to have ħ factors, but in the problem statement, the eigenvectors are dimensionless because operators are multiplied by ħ/2. So eigenvectors are just vectors (spinors), which are dimensionless. So option A has ħ, which probably isn't correct.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → but this looks like the spherical coordinates for a point on a sphere, but not necessarily the eigenvector. Also, in our problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi would be zero or pi. So perhaps this is the general form, but I don't think this is the eigenvector.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → which matches our result.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ) → again with ħ, which seems incorrect because eigenvectors are normalized spinors, so they shouldn't have ħ in them.

Wait, but the problem statement mentions "the elements of the normalized eigenvector", so the answer should be a vector of numbers, not including ħ.

So from that, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

But wait, let's think again. Because the operator P is in the direction n, and we're finding the eigenvector, but the eigenvector's form depends on the angle theta, which is the angle of n from the z-axis.

Wait, in the case where n is along z (theta=0), then n_x=0, n_z=1.

In that case, the eigenvector should be [0, 1], because P_z |+> = (ħ/2)|+>, and the eigenvector for +1/2 is [0,1]^T.

Wait, according to our earlier result, when theta=0, cos(theta/2)=1, sin(theta/2)=0 → so the vector is [1,0], which is incorrect because for P_z, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [0,1]. So something's wrong here.

Wait, this is a problem. My conclusion earlier must be wrong because when theta=0, the eigenvector should be [0,1], but according to option C, it would be [1,0], which is the eigenstate for -ħ/2.

Wait, so there's a mistake in my calculation.

Let me re-examine the steps.

Earlier, I wrote the eigenvector as [n_x, 1 -n_z], which, when theta=0, becomes [0, 1 -1]= [0,0], which can't be right.

But wait, when theta=0, n_x= sin(0)=0, n_z= cos(0)=1.

So substituting into equation (1):

(n_z -1) a +n_x b = (1-1)a +0*b=0 → 0=0, which gives no info.

Equation (2):

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 + (-1-1) b = (-2) b =0 → b=0.

So the solution is a arbitrary, b=0.

So the eigenvector is [a, 0], and normalization requires a=1, so the vector is [1, 0], which corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P_z ?

Wait, but wait, the eigenvalues of P_z are ± ħ/2. Let me check the operator P_z:

P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the eigenvalues are 1*(ħ/2) and -1*(ħ/2).

So the +ħ/2 eigenvalue is [0,1]? Or [1,0]?

Wait, no: Let me compute P_z acting on [1,0]^T.

P_z |v> = (ħ/2) [[1 0],[0 -1]] [1;0] = (ħ/2) [1; 0] → which is (ħ/2) |v>, so [1,0] is the +eigenvalue.

Wait, so when n is along z (theta=0), the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct. But according to our earlier conclusion, when theta=0, option C gives [cos(0), sin(0)] = [1,0], which is correct.

But wait, earlier when I thought that for P_z, the + eigenvalue is [0,1], I was wrong. No, [1,0] is the + eigenvalue.

Wait, no, wait: Let me compute P_z * [0,1]^T:

= (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] [0;1] = (ħ/2) [0; -1] → which is -ħ/2 * [0;1], so [0,1] is the - eigenvalue. So [1,0] is +, [0,1] is -.

So when theta=0, our formula gives [1,0], which is correct, so the previous conclusion wasn't wrong.

Earlier, I thought when theta=0, the eigenvector should be [0,1], but that's incorrect. No, it's [1,0] because P_z has eigenvalue +ħ/2 for [1,0].

So, the conclusion that the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is correct.

So looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but the question mentions that the eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the correct normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, the options have option C as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems to be exactly that.

So that would be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as a $2 \times 2$ matrix scaled by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator in the Direction of $\vec{n}$**:  
   The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z \right).
   \]
   Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, this becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve:
   \[
   \left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
   \]
   Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ and $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$, the eigenvalue equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0.
   \]

3. **Solving for the Eigenvector**:  
   The system of equations simplifies to:
   \[
   (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
   \]
   These equations are consistent and yield the eigenvector proportional to:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta \\ 1 - \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Normalization**:  
   The norm of the eigenvector is:
   \[
   \sqrt{|\sin\theta|^2 + |1 - \cos\theta|^2} = \sqrt{2(1 - \cos\theta)}.
   \]
   Using the trigonometric identities $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless spinors.
  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$  
  This represents spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the normalized eigenvector derived above.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for eigenvectors.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
