Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right? So the structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. The problem gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Oh, right, that's the d-spacing. I think I remember the formula for d-spacing in crystals. The general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But this is a rhombohedral system, which is a special case where a=b=c and α=β=γ. So the formula must be adjusted for that.

I think the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so θ is 30°, and a is the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait, the problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter a is the same as the interatomic distance only if it's a primitive lattice. Or is that correct? Hmm. No, the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest atoms. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of the unit cell, right? So for a simple rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter a is the edge length, which equals the interatomic distance. So I think a is 10 Angstroms here.

So for the (111) plane, h, k, l are all 1. Let's plug into the formula.

So d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*cos(30°))

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step. The numerator is a, which is 10.

The denominator's square root part is sqrt( (1+1+1) + 2*(1 + 1 +1 ) * cos30 )

So 1+1+1 is 3. The terms in the second part: 2*(3)*cos30. Because 1*1 is 1, and there are three such terms (hk, hl, kl), each 1*1. So 2*(1+1+1) = 2*3 =6. So the entire denominator under the sqrt is 3 + 6*cos(30 degrees).

Cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.8660.

So compute 3 + 6*(√3/2) = 3 + 3√3. Let me compute that numerically. √3 is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is approximately 5.196. So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.196). Let's compute sqrt(8.196). Hmm, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(8.196) is a bit less than 3, around 2.86, because 2.86^2 is 8.1796, which is close to 8.196. Maybe approximately 2.862.

So d = 10 / 2.862 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Hold on, no, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but perhaps I'm calculating d_{111} correctly. Oh, wait, wait no. Wait, I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another thought—maybe the formula I'm using is for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, but perhaps I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me recheck. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But since α=β=γ=30°, and for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )

Because 1*1 is 1 for each term, and there are three terms, so 3 * cos30.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6 * cos30 )

Wait, yes. So that's correct. So cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 is about 5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)≈2.862.

So d=10 / 2.862 ≈ 3.492 Angstroms. But none of the options are near 3.49. All options are around 9 Ang. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the unit cell's lattice parameter 'a' with the interatomic distance. Maybe in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance isn't equal to 'a'? Hmm. Wait, for a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps it's different because of the angles.

Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which can be thought of as a cube that's been skewed. The atoms are at the corners, so the interatomic distance is the edge length 'a' times something. Wait no, the edge length 'a' is the distance between adjacent atoms. So in a simple structure, the interatomic distance is 'a'. So perhaps my initial approach is correct. But if that's the case, the answer I got (about 3.49) doesn't match any options, so I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe the lattice parameters are different. Because in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, but perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length a. So maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I've messed up the formula. Let me think again. Another approach: The interplanar distance formula for a general crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (A) + ... )

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for rhombohedral, there's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the volume formula to find the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, another thought: The formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate sqrt(8.196) more accurately. Let's compute 8.196^0.5.

2.86^2 = 8.1796.

2.862^2 = (2.86 + 0.002)^2 = 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*.002 + 0.002^2 = 8.1796 + 0.01144 + 0.000004 ≈ 8.191.

Wait, so 2.862 squared is about 8.191, which is just a little less than 8.196. So 2.863^2 = 8.191 + something. Let me compute 2.863^2:

(2.862 + 0.001)^2 = 2.862² + 2*2.862 * 0.001 + 0.001² = 8.191 + 0.005724 + 0.000001 = ~8.196725.

Oh, so sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.862 + 0.001*( (8.196 - 8.191)/ (2*2.862) )

Wait, maybe an easier way. Since 2.863² is ~8.1967, which is very close to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d ≈ 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.490 Angstroms. Still, this isn't matching any of the options given. The options are 9.08, 8.95, 9.54, 10.05 Angstroms.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh, wait—am I using the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system?

Another approach: Let me look up the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system.

Wait, according to what I remember, the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

where θ is the angle between the unit vectors (all equal to 30 degrees in this case).

So I think I did that correctly. Let me recompute.

a is 10 Ang. So:

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 6 * cos30 )

cos30 = ~0.8660.

So 6*0.8660 = 5.196.

3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196)≈2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angs.

Hmm. That's way below the options given. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps the question is not about a simple rhombohedral structure.

Wait, maybe the question is about a face-centered or body-centered rhombohedral system? But rhombohedral is usually considered as a simple system because adding more atoms complicates it into a different system.

Wait, another possibility: did I mix up the indices? The question asks for (111) plane, but perhaps I should be using a different formula, perhaps involving the reciprocal lattice?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a hexagonal close-packed structure, but no, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the given 'interatomic distance' is not the lattice parameter a, but something else. Because in a simple cubic lattice, the interatomic distance is a, but in other structures, like body-centered, it's a√3/4? Wait, no, that's for body-centered cubic's nearest neighbor distance.

Wait, in a simple rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a. Because the atoms are at the corners, connected by edges of length a. So the nearest neighbor distance is a.

Wait, so no, the initial assumption that a=10 is correct.

But the problem is that according to the calculation, the interplanar distance is 3.49 Ang, but the options are all around 9. So perhaps I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula for the reciprocal space? Let me think.

Another approach: The reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral system have h, k, l as integers. The d-spacing is given by 1/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^0.5 multiplied by the lattice parameter, but I think that's the same as the formula I'm using.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula inverted. Maybe it's a multiplied by the reciprocal of the square root term.

Wait, no, I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually d = (a) * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

No, that's what I did. So if that's correct, then the calculation is right. But the answer isn't matching any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. No, that's not the case. The angles α, β, γ are the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should use the volume of the unit cell in the formula.

Wait, another formula for d-spacing is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) ), which is what I've been using.

But another approach: The formula for d_{hkl} is 1/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) ) + 2 (hk + hl + kl)/(a^2) cosθ ) )

Wait, that's the same as what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this term sqrt(8.196) more accurately.

Wait, 8.196 is a bit more than 8.196. Let me compute sqrt(8.196) precisely.

Let me compute:

2.863^2 = ?

2.863 * 2.863 = ?

Let me compute 2.86 * 2.86:

2.86 * 2.86 = (2 + 0.86)^2 = 4 + 2*2*0.86 + 0.86^2 = 4 + 3.44 + 0.7396 = 8.1796.

Now, 2.863 is 2.86 + 0.003.

So (2.86 + 0.003)^2 = 2.86^2 + 2*2.86*0.003 + 0.003^2.

Which is 8.1796 + 0.01716 + 0.000009 = 8.196769.

So 2.863^2 ≈8.19677, which is very close to 8.196.

Hence sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈3.490 Ang.

Wait, but the options are all larger than 8.9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the rhombohedral system requires using the reciprocal of the formula or something else.

Another thought: Maybe the given angles are in degrees, and I should compute cos correctly.

Wait, I used cos(30 degrees) as sqrt(3)/2, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d_{hkl} = a / (sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

But maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (1)/(h² + k² + l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ) )

Yes, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the Miller indices as (1,1,1) leading to a particular form, but perhaps I should consider the unit cell's volume.

Wait, another approach: The volume of the unit cell in a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3 θ ). Maybe that could come into play?

Wait, but how would that affect the d-spacing? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 1, 1) / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1 +1 +1) cosθ )

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) (1, 0, 0) - something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) ) * something.

Wait, another approach: Let me look for the formula for a rhombohedral system's d-spacing.

Found that the formula is indeed d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So I think I'm using the correct formula.

Wait, but perhaps the given interatomic distance is NOT a. Because in some cases, the interatomic distance is not the same as a. For example, in a face-centered cubic, the interatomic distance is a√2 / 2, not a. But in a simple cubic, it's a.

Wait, but this is a rhombohedral structure, which is a type of primitive lattice. So the interatomic distance would be a. So the given 10 Ang is a.

But according to my calculation, the d-spacing is ~3.49 Ang, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should compute the denominator correctly again.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator^2 = h² +k² + l² + 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ )

h=k=l=1, so:

Denominator^2 = 1+1+1 + 2*(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 )

=3 + 2*(3 * 0.8660 )

=3 + 6 * 0.8660

=3 + 5.196

=8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d=10 /2.863 ≈3.49 Ang.

Hmm. But the options are much larger. Wait, perhaps I've swapped the reciprocal? Because sometimes d = 1/ ( ... ), but no, the formula I've used is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the (111) plane, but the formula is for (100) or some other plane. No, the (111) plane uses hkl=1,1,1.

Wait, maybe the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30? Let me check the question again.

No, the question states all angles are 30 degrees.

So perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again.

Is the interplanar distance the same as the interatomic distance? No, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, while the interplanar distance is the spacing between planes.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the interplanar distance in a different way. Another thought: Maybe the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal of the structure factor or something else. No, that's unrelated.

Wait another angle: Maybe I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator, but that wouldn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = (a) * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Wait, no, that would make the denominator bigger, leading to a smaller d. So that's not.

Wait, perhaps I should have a factor of 2 in the denominator somewhere else. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is what I used.

Hmm. So why is my calculation not matching any of the options?

Alternative approach: Maybe I should compute the interplanar distance using the volume of the unit cell.

The volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3θ )

Wait, for θ=30 degrees, let's compute that.

V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 -3*(sqrt(3)/2) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So:

1 - 3*(0.8660) = 1 -2.598 = -1.598.

2*(0.8660)^3 = 2*(0.6495) ≈1.299.

So inside the sqrt: -1.598 +1.299 = -0.299.

Wait, sqrt of a negative number? That can't be right. So that implies that the unit cell volume is imaginary, which is impossible. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the volume is a^3 * sqrt(1 + 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3θ )

Wait, I think I might have misremembered the formula for the volume. Let me think.

The volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is given by:

V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - (cosα + cosβ + cosγ) + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ )

But if α=β=γ=θ, then:

V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3θ )

So substituting θ=30 degrees:

cosθ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So:

V = 1000 * sqrt( 1 - 3*(0.8660) + 2*(0.8660)^3 )

Compute the terms:

3 *0.8660 =2.598.

(0.8660)^3 = (0.8660)*(0.8660)*(0.8660) ≈0.6495.

2 *0.6495 =1.299.

So:

1 -2.598 +1.299 = (1 +1.299) -2.598 = 2.299 -2.598 = -0.299.

So again, the expression inside the sqrt is negative, which can’t be correct. That can’t be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is different. Maybe the volume is a^3 * sqrt(1 + 3 cosθ + 2 cos^3θ ), but with a plus sign?

Let me compute that: 1 +3*(0.8660) +2*(0.8660)^3.

1 +2.598 +1.299 =4.897.

So sqrt(4.897)≈2.213.

So V=1000 *2.213= 2213 Å^3.

But I'm not sure how this helps with the d-spacing. Because the volume is needed for the reciprocal lattice or calculating structure factors, but I’m not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d-spacing is 1/sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (cosθ)/a^2 )

Which again is the same as before.

So I'm back to the same calculation. So according to this, the answer is approximately 3.49 Angstroms, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, but the options are all about 9 Ang. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the given interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the edge length but scaled by some factor. For instance, in a face-centered cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√2/2. But in a simple cubic, it's a. So perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a * something.

Wait, but the structure is simple, so the interatomic distance is a.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a simple rhombohedral structure but a hexagonal close-packed structure. But the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, unless the (111) plane in a different system, like hexagonal. No, the question states it's a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The reciprocal of the d-spacing is given by:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (cosθ)/(a²)

So,

1/d^2 = (1 +1 +1)/(10^2) + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * (cos30°)/(10^2)

= 3/(100) + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)/(100)

= 3/100 + (6*0.8660)/100

= 0.03 + 0.05196 = 0.08196.

So 1/d^2 = 0.08196 → d^2 = 1/0.08196 ≈12.20.

So d ≈ sqrt(12.20) ≈3.492.

Same result as before.

So I'm confident that the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm misapplying the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look for the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is indeed d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So the calculation seems correct. But the answer isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A) 9.08 Ang

B) 8.95 Ang

C) 9.54 Ang

D) 10.05 Ang

So maybe I messed up the formula's denominator. Maybe I should have (h² +k² +l²) multiplied by a factor, but perhaps I should consider the reciprocal.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute using the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

Which is the same as I did.

Wait, but perhaps I should have taken the reciprocal of that, but that would give d = a * (sqrt(...)), which would be larger, but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have done:

d = a * sqrt( [ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ]^{-1} )

Which is the same as what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal lattice vectors. Because in reciprocal space, the d-spacing is 1/d = |h a* + k b* + l c* |.

Wait, but that's getting complicated, and I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck, but my calculation gives me ~3.49 Ang, which doesn't match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but since the options are all higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should compute using sin instead of cos? No, that doesn't make sense because the angles are between the lattice vectors.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I confused the angles. The formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors, which are 30 degrees each. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk cos(180-30) + ... ) )

Because sometimes angles are defined as the angles between the edges, which could be the supplementary angle. So if the angle between vectors is 30 degrees, the angle between the planes would be 150 degrees. But in the formula, it's the lattice vectors' angles, which are given as 30 degrees.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula uses the angles between the lattice vectors, which are α, β, γ. So if the problem gives α=30°, then I should use 30°, not 150°.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have cos(60°) instead of cos(30°), but that would only happen if the angles were between the planes, not the vectors.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong sign for the cosine. Because sometimes in crystallography, the angles are defined based on the dot product, which for a rhombohedral system can have negative cosines depending on the structure.

Wait, for a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a rhombohedron, which can be acute or obtuse. In this case, all angles are 30°, which is acute.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute value or something else. But I don't think so.

Perhaps the question intended to ask for the (100) plane, but that's just a guess.

Wait, let's compute for (100) plane, hkl=1,0,0.

Then denominator^2 = 1 +0+0 + 2*(1*0 +1*0 +0*0) cos30 =1. So d=10/1=10 Ang. Which is option D, but the question specifies (111).

Hmm. So perhaps I'm not considering something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a different factor, like 1/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cosθ ), but for a different reason.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a/(sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Let me try that.

So denominator^2=3 - 2*3*cos30 =3 -6*(0.8660)=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, so sqrt can't be taken. So that's impossible.

So that can't be the case.

Another possible approach: Perhaps I should have used the angles as 60 degrees, but the problem says 30.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that would give a denominator^2 of 3 -6*(0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196 → impossible.

So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the (111) plane is very close to the (100), but the calculation is way off.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) ).

But that would give sqrt(3 -6*0.866) which is sqrt(-2.196) → imaginary.

So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

That's correct, which leads to the same result as before.

So I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the answer isn't among the options. But since the problem is given, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance isn't 'a' but something else. Let me think again.

In a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has 6 atoms, right? No, wait no, a simple rhombohedral unit cell has 2 atoms. Wait, no, wait: the conventional unit cell of a rhombohedral structure has 2 atoms, but sometimes it's considered as a primitive cell with 1 atom.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between the two atoms in the unit cell, so the edge length 'a' would be that distance divided by something.

Wait, no, in a simple cubic structure, the unit cell has 1 atom, and the edge length a is the interatomic distance. In a simple rhombohedral, it's similar.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as a for a simple structure, which is what the problem says. So I'm confident in my calculation.

But the options don't match. So perhaps I should consider that the (111) plane's interplanar distance is the reciprocal of my calculated value. But that would make it about 0.286 Ang, which is even smaller and doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 2 times the denominator. Wait, is it possible that the formula is d = a/(2 * sqrt(...)) ?

Let me try that.

So denominator is 2.863 → 2 * denominator is 5.726.

So d =10 /5.726 ≈1.746 Ang. No, that's not in options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( denominator ), but that would give a larger d.

So 2.863 *10=28.63, which isn't correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer should be around 3.49 Ang, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to find an error in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the given angles α=β=γ=30 degrees are the angles between the crystallographic axes in the reciprocal lattice. That would complicate things, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a', but I should calculate the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is about a face-centered cubic structure, which is a special case of a rhombohedral structure with angles 60 degrees. But the angles here are 30, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a hexagonal crystal, but it's stated as rhombohedral.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the reciprocal of d.

So if d is 3.49, then 1/d is ~0.286 Å^-1. But I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

Which is what I used.

Hmm. Wait, another thought: Perhaps the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Another approach: The reciprocal lattice parameter for the (111) plane is given by:

d = 1/(h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, but that's in reciprocal space units. So d would be in reciprocal angstroms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of the angles or the formula.

Since I'm stuck, maybe I should go back to the options and see if any of them could be the result of a miscalculation.

Wait, one of the options is 9.08. Let me compute 10 divided by about 1.101 to get 9.08.

Because 9.08 is 10 / ~1.101.

So 1.101 squared is ~1.212. So 1.212 is the denominator squared.

So denominator would be sqrt(1.212) ≈1.101.

So for that, the denominator squared would be 1.212.

But according to our earlier calculation, the denominator squared is 8.196, which is much larger than 1.212. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, 10 / (1/sqrt(8.196)) )=10 * sqrt(8.196 )=10 * 2.863=28.63. No, that's not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think: In a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² )

If the angles were 90 degrees, then the problem would be cubic. What would the (111) plane's d-spacing be?

It would be 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 Ang. But that's not an option either.

So perhaps the problem is intended to be a cubic system, but the angles given are 30, which makes it rhombohedral. But the only way the options are in that range is if the formula uses the reciprocal.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

In that case, for (111):

d =10 * sqrt(3 +6*(0.8660) )

=10 * sqrt(3 +5.196)=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10 * 2.863=28.63 Ang. Which is way higher than any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(3 -6 *0.8660) =10 * sqrt(-2.196) → which is imaginary. So no.

Another thought: Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-θ) )

But θ is 30, so cos(150)= -cos30=-0.8660.

So denominator^2=3 -6*(-0.8660)=3 +5.196=8.196.

So same as before.

Thus, d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake, but I can't find where. So perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but due to the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should forget the formula and think about the structure. In a rhombohedral system with acute angles, the (111) plane is closer together than the (100) plane.

But according to the calculation, (111) is closer than (100). But in the options, the numbers are all around 9 Ang., which is near 10.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the (100) plane, which would have d=10 Ang (if a=10), but the question specifies (111).

Wait, perhaps the formula uses a different approach when all the angles are the same, like a cubic system. But no, 30° angles make it rhombohedral.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / something.

But I can't think of any. Maybe the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) ) / (h +k +l) )

But for (111), h+k+l=3. So sqrt(3)/3 = 1/sqrt(3). So d=10 * (1/sqrt(3)) )=5.773 Ang. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the (111) plane's interplanar distance is the same as the interatomic distance. But that would be 10 Ang, which is option D. But that's only true for the (100) plane in a cubic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, 8.95 Ang. Let me see what denominator would give that.

d=8.95 → denominator =10/8.95≈1.1169.

Denominator squared= (1.1169)^2≈1.247.

So 1.247=3 +6*(cos30) ?

Wait, no, that would be 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196, not 1.247.

So that's impossible.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. But according to all the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. However, since the problem gives four options, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) ) * cosθ.

But that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cos(180-θ) )

Which would be:

Denominator^2=3 +6 * (-0.8660) =3-5.196= -2.196. Which is impossible.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to choose an option. But the calculation leads me to 3.49, which isn't present. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a hexagonal system, which isn't applicable, but for the sake of trying, let's see.

In a hexagonal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + hk +k^2) + (l^2)(3/4) )

But that's only for hexagonal close-packed, and the structure is rhombohedral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Which is what I did. So I think I'm correct, but perhaps the intended answer is option B, 8.95.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with cosθ as 60 degrees.

Let's try that.

cos60=0.5.

Denominator^2=3 +6*(0.5) =3 +3=6.

Denominator= sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082 Ang. Still not matching.

But if the angles were 60°, the denominator would be sqrt(6), giving d≈4.08, which isn't an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, the closest is none.

But since I have to choose an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option B, 8.95 Ang.

Wait, why 8.95?

Wait, perhaps the formula uses a different approach. Let me think: Maybe the formula is d= a / (sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) + something )

But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / ( ... )

No, I can't think of a reason.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is using the face-centered cubic formula. For (111) in FCC, the d-spacing is a√3/3. But for a=10, that would be 10*1.732/3≈5.773 Ang. Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (h +k +l) )

As before, which is 5.773. Not an option.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. But as per the options, I'll have to choose the closest. However, all options are about 9 Ang, which is bigger than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (something else).

Wait, when I calculated the denominator, I get sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But if the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ), then for (111), it's 10*sqrt(3)=17.32, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Another possibility is that the given interatomic distance is the radius of the atoms, but that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the same atoms in a different configuration, but I don't know.

In conclusion, I think I'm confident that my calculation gives d≈3.49 Ang, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. However, given the options, I can't see which could be correct. But perhaps the intended answer is option B, 8.95 Ang, but I can't see how that arises from the formula I used.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}}
\]

For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \), and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \). Substituting these values:

\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) \cos 30^\circ}}
\]

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot \cos 30^\circ}
\]

Substituting \( \cos 30^\circ \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\sqrt{3 + 6 \cdot 0.866} = \sqrt{3 + 5.196} = \sqrt{8.196}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{8.196} \):

\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( d_{111} \)
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Analysis of the options
The calculated value of \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the given options, which are all around 9 Å. This discrepancy suggests either a misunderstanding of the problem or an issue with the provided options. The calculation was verified multiple times, and the formula used is consistent with the standard formula for rhombohedral systems.

Given the mismatch, it is unclear how any of the provided options (A: 9.08 Å, B: 8.95 Å, C: 9.54 Å, D: 10.05 Å) could correspond to the correct result. However, if forced to choose, the closest option might be **B: 8.95 Å**, though this does not align with the derived value.

### Conclusion
The calculated interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but since this is not among the options, the most plausible answer based on the given choices is:

**Answer: B**
