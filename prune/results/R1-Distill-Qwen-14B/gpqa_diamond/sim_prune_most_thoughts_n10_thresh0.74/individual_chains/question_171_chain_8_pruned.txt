Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically with bromine. Hmm, I remember that when bromine undergoes electrophilic substitution, it usually adds as a substituent to the benzene ring. The question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction in the products for each of the six given compounds. I need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield.

Wait, the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh right, because they're using excess bromine, but it's a substitution reaction, so each molecule will substitute once. So each starting material will form a brominated product.

The key here is to figure out for each substituent how the directing effects work. Electrophilic substitution is influenced by the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho, meta, or para positions.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group (because it's an electron donor via +I effect) and ortho/para-directing. So when bromination happens, the para position would be a major product. So for this compound, the para isomer's yield is high.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the substituent is on the benzene, so when the ring has a substituent, the incoming Br+ will add either ortho, meta, or para to it. For methyl, which is activating and para/ortho-directing, the major product would be para. So the para-isomer would be the major product, and thus the weight fraction would be higher than others.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no. The substituent is a COOEt group, meaning it's an ester substituent. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's deactivating. Now, esters are meta-directing. So when Br is added, the meta position would be favored. So the para-isomer would be less, but wait, wait. Wait,
