Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem involves Compound X, which has specific IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are in the regions: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610, 1450 cm-1. Hmm. The strong peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 region is more typical for a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are usually higher, like ~2800 for the stretch. Oh wait, no—the C=O stretch for aldehydes is around 1720 as well. But another thing: if there's a peak around 1610 and 1450, those are likely aromatic ring vibrations. So the compound probably has a benzene ring.

The IR also has a broad peak between 3400–2500. That's a wide region. A broad peak around 3000-3500 could indicate O-H stretching, like in a carboxylic acid. But if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or another type of O-H. Alternatively, it could be an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually sparser. Wait, the region 3400-2500—if it's a very broad, maybe it's an O-H group. But wait, another possibility is an alkyne, which would show up in that region as a strong absorption, but it's usually a sharp peak, not a broad one. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500-3300. So maybe that's what it is.

Now looking at the NMR data. 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, could it be a carboxylic acid proton? No, those are usually broad around 10-12 ppm, but maybe this is an aldehyde. Alternatively, an acidic proton like from a phenol? But 10.5 seems high for phenol. Hmm. Wait, another thought: if it's a ketone, then maybe it's something else. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. So 10.5 is consistent with an aldehyde proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons on the ring would split into two doublets, each with 2H. So that's a benzene ring with substituents para to each other.

Next, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): That's a multiplet, integrating to 1H. This could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether, or maybe a methine attached to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group next to something else.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This is a multiplet, 2H. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits the signal into a doublet, like adjacent to a CH2 group. For example, in an isobutyl group, the methyl would be split due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. This is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, such as in an ethyl chain. So maybe something like a pentyl or a butyl group where the terminal CH2 is attached to a methyl.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is likely a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720 cm-1) and the other is an alkyl group. Wait, but wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1610 and 1450. Those are typical for aromatic C=C stretching. So the ring is probably substituted with groups that don't
