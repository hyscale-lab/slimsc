Okay, so I have this physics problem about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. But wait, I need to find the order of magnitude, so maybe I don't need to worry too much about exact constants.

The problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon and the distance d. So first, I probably need to find the radius of the event horizon. Oh right, the angular size formula is θ ≈ (R) / (d), but I think it's more precise to use θ (in radians) ≈ R / d. But wait, the given θ is in degrees, so I'll have to convert that to radians first.

Let me calculate R. θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert to radians: 1 degree is π/180 radians, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians roughly. Hmm, but maybe I can approximate it as 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19.

Then R ≈ θ_rad * d. Wait, d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh wait, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters. 

So R ≈ θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 ≈ let's calculate that. 1.745e-19 * 3e26 is about 5.235e7 meters. Wait, 3e26 is 3 times 1e26, so 1e26 * 1.745e-19 is 1.745e7, then times 3 is about 5.235e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.235e7 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c².
