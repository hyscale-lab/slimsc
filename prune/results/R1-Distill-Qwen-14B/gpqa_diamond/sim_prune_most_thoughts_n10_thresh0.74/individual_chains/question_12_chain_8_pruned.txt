Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to remember the formulas and concepts.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? So Pi meson decays into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest initially, so the total initial momentum should be zero. That probably means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Oh yeah, because momentum is a vector quantity.

I remember that in particle decay problems, energy and momentum conservation are key. Also, the rest masses of the particles matter. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. But the neutrino is tricky because it's super light. Wait, I think in these problems, the neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, so it's treated as massless. That might simplify things.

So, the initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. The initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have their energies and momenta such that their sum equals the initial.

Let me think: the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero (or negligible, we can ignore it).

So, total energy before decay (E_initial) is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. The total energy after decay (E_final) is E_muon + E_neutrino. Which is (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu. Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final. So 139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu. That gives K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, for momentum conservation. The initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after must be zero too. The muon has momentum p, and the neutrino has momentum p' in the opposite direction. So p = p' in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, considering the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = |p_nu| c. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². Hmm, not sure about the units here, but all masses are given in MeV/c², so maybe I can ignore the c's in the equations for simplicity.

Wait, I think I should work in units where c=1 to make things easier. So, E_muon = sqrt( p_mu² + m_mu² ), and E_nu = p_nu. 

But since the momenta are opposite, p_mu = p_nu = p, let's say. So, E_muon = sqrt(p
