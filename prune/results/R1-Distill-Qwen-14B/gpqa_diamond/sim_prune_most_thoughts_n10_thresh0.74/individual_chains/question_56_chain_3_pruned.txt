Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are crucial here.

So, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in non-relativistic theory are: delta l = ±1, and delta m = 0, ±1. But wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So, what can it transition to in one step?

Since l starts at 0, the first transition must change l by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. That would mean the first step could be to |2,1,m>, because n must decrease by 1 or more? Wait, wait, no. Wait, n can change by any integer, but l can only change by ±1. So, starting from n=3, l=0, m=0.

First transition: l must go to 1, so the new state is |n', 1, m'>. What about n' in the first step? Since the initial state is n=3, the next state could be n=2 or n=4? Because delta n isn't strictly fixed by the selection rules, but in reality, the allowed transitions are those where the energy allows. But wait, in this case, the decay is to n=1, so probably two steps: 3→2→1.

Wait, but the problem says it decays via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process. So first step is 3→2, and second is 2→1.

But what about the possible l and m values in each step?

First transition from |3,0,0>:

l must go from 0 → 1. So possible states are |n',1,m'⟩. What are the allowed m' values? The selection rule for m is delta m = 0, ±1. Since initial m is 0, in the first transition, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the first transition is from 3,0,0 to something else
