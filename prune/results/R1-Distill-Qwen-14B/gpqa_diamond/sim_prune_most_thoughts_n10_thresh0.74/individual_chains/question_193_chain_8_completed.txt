Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, I think I should write that down: N ∝ 1 / plx^5. Or in other words, N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant.

Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. So, they want to know the relation between N and r. Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So if I can express N in terms of d, maybe I can find how N changes with d, which is the distance. Let me try substituting plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that exponent: (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So the inverse of that is d^5. Therefore, N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, because N is the total number of stars up to a certain distance, but the question is about the density or the number per unit distance. Or wait, maybe it's about the change in the number of stars with distance, so like the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The original statement says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when plx is small (which happens when d is large), N increases. But how does N depend on d?

So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as the fifth power. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Maybe I should consider how many stars are there per unit distance, which would involve the derivative of N with respect to d.

Let me think. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dr would be approximately the change in N. So dN = (dN/dd) * dr. So the number per unit distance is dN/dr = dN/dd. Since N is proportional to d^5, dN/dd = 5 * k * d^4. So dN/dr is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the options don't have a d^4 in the answer. Let me check the options again. Oh, the options are about the number of stars as a function of distance, but per unit range. So perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance, so that's dN/dr.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Then, since plx = 1/d, 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5. But the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. So if you move a unit distance further, how much does N increase?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it step by step.

1. Given: N ∝ 1/plx^5.
2. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/d.
3. Substitute into N: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a proportionality constant.
4. The question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. So, if r is the distance, then the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, etc. So option B is r^5, which would match this conclusion. But wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" 

Oh wait, wait. Maybe I misread the question. It says the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N is the number of stars in a unit volume. Or maybe it's the number per unit distance?

Wait, no. The number of stars is a count. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. So, as distance increases, the number of stars you observe increases as d^5.

But the option B is r^5. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when we talk about the number of stars as a function of distance, we might be considering the density. Or perhaps the question is about the number per unit volume or something else.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the number of stars might depend on the volume, which depends on d^3. But in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5.

Hmm. So, the number of stars is proportional to d^5. Therefore, as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power.

So, the answer should be B) ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{d})^5} = d^5 \). Thus, the number of stars is proportional to \( d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This implies considering the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the change in the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4 \). However, the question specifically asks for the relationship between \( N \) and \( d \), not the rate of change. Therefore, the number of stars increases as \( d^5 \), and the correct answer is \( \sim r^5 \).

Answer: B
