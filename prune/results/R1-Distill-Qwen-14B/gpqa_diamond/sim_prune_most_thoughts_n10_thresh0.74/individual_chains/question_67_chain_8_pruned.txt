Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, l is the total angular momentum, and m is the z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We're to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm, okay, I remember that for angular momentum, the z-component eigenvalues are mħ. So for each electron, Lz could be mħ, where m is their respective m values.

Wait, but wait a second. Each electron has its own angular momentum quantum number l, which for p orbitals is 1. So l1 and l2 are both 1. Then, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, which is the sum of 1 and 1. The m value for the total state is -1.

But the question is about the individual m1 and m2 values of each electron, right? Because L1z and L2z are the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum.

So, the state is a coupled state with L² and L_z eigenvalues. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>.

I think the state can be written as a combination of the product states of the individual m1 and m2 states. Because when you have two particles, the total state is a combination of their individual states.

Wait, the total state |l1, l2, l, m> is a specific eigenstate of the total angular momentum L² and L_z. But when you want to find the probability of getting specific m1 and m2 values, you have to decompose this coupled state into the uncoupled basis, which is the product of the individual m1 and m2 states.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = -1. So m1 can be from -1 to +1, and m2 the same, and their sum is -1.

Wait, but in this case, for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1 because l=1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to m=-1 are:

( -1, 0 ), (0, -1 ), and ( -1, -1 )? Wait no, because (-1) + 0 = -1, 0 + (-1) = -1, and (-1) + (-1) would be -2, which doesn't add to -1. So only the first two pairs are possible.

Wait, but wait, are there any other possibilities? Let's see. m1 can be -1, 0, +1. m2 can be the same. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible combinations:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

m1 = +1, m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1,0, +1. So no, that's not possible.

Similarly, m1 = -2 isn't possible either.

So the only possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

But wait, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two states. So the state can be written as a linear combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but how do the coefficients work? I think the state |l1, l
