Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically with bromine. The question is about the para-isomer yield for different benzene derivatives. Hmm, I remember that substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—like ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, the question gives six substances, each with a different substituent. They're all undergoing substitution with excess bromine, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the one with the least para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Let me list the substituents again:

1) C6H5-CH3 → methyl group
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → ethyl ester (like a COOEt group)
3) C6H5-Cl → chlorine atom
4) C6H5-NO2 → nitro group
5) C6H5-C2H5 → ethyl group
6) C6H5-COOH → carboxylic acid group

Each substituent affects the ring in a different way. First, I need to remember what each group does in terms of directing and activating.

Nitro groups (NO2) are meta directors and deactivating. So when nitro is on the ring, the next substitution tends to happen in the meta position. But wait, in electrophilic substitution, if a substituent is meta-directing, does that mean that the incoming group goes para to it? Or am I mixing that up?

Wait, no. The substituent directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions. For example, methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So if I have a methyl group on benzene, the next substitution is more likely at ortho or para positions.

But wait, the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So when the substituent is ortho/para-directing, the major product is a mix of ortho and para. But for a strong deactivating group like nitro, which is meta-directing, the incoming group will go meta to it. So for a nitro-substituted benzene, the next group would be in the meta position relative to the nitro.

Wait, but in this problem, it's the benzene ring that's already substituted with one group, and we're adding another bromine. So for each substituent, when we brominate, the position of the bromine depends on the substituent's directing effects.

So the substituents can be categorized based on their directing effects:

- Activating groups: like -CH3 (methyl), -COOEt (ester?), -C2H5 (ethyl), -COOH. Wait, wait, no, wait. Actually, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Similarly, carboxylic acids are deactivating.

Wait, let me correct that. The substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions.

Methyl group (-CH3): activating, ortho/para-directing.
Ethyl group (-C2H
