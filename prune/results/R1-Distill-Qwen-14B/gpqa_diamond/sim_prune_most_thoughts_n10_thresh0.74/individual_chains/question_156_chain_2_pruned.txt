Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because epoxidation and HPLC analysis can be tricky, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The reactants are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard and chiral.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is a reaction where an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. The type of stereochemistry in the starting alkene affects the epoxide's structure.

So, reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Let me visualize that. E-4-octene has the two methyl groups (since octene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, wait no, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3â€”no, wait. Oh, wait, no, wait, for oct-4-ene, the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond (C4 and C5) are each two CH2 groups. Wait, wait, no. Let me count. The structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, octene is C8H16. So, for oct-4-ene, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively,
