Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction involves different starting materials and reagents, and after both are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will observe in each case.

First, let me look at Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group, so when reduced, it should become a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon, which has a methoxy group.

So the molecule is: O

CH3-C-OCH3

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH3(CH2)3-C(=O)-OCH3? No, wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CH-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO something. Wait, hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hexane is six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's 3-pentanone. Wait, no, hexan-3-one would have the structure: CH2CH2CO in the middle. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, the correct structure for hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO with
