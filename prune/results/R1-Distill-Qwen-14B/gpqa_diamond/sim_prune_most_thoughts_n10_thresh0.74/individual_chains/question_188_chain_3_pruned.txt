Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the structure repeats in different planes, and the interplanar distance refers to the distance between these planes. The question asks about the (111) plane.

Wait, the given data is that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters are usually a = b = c, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, rhombohedral has a, b, c all equal, but all angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal too. So in this case, the lattice is rhombohedral with a = b = c, and each angle is 30 degrees.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distanceâ€”so the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice. So probably, that's the lattice parameter a. Because in a cubic structure, a is the edge length, which would be the interatomic distance along the cube edges. So in this case, the rhombohedral has a = 10 Angstroms. Because the angles are 30 degrees each.

Now, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h
