Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five of these compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are different compounds, I think. Let's break down what each part says.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the reaction is probably something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, usually unreactive, so if A1 is causing it to react, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, so maybe A1 has a high oxidation state of F.

Then, A3 is another compound which can interact with xenon too. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. Hmm, fluorinating Y in a 1:1 molar ratio. So maybe Y is being fluorinated to form a binary compound, like YF. But wait, binary compounds generally have two elements, so Y and F. But sometimes, especially with metals, they can form different stoichiometries, like YF2, YF3, etc.

Next, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. So A4 is some solution, maybe a solution of YF something in water. Adding Y (probably as a metal) in a 1:1 ratio to A4 gives A5. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that dissociates in water.

The question is to find the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

I think I'll need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's start with A1.

A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. I remember that KClO3 decomposes into KCl and O2 when heated, but that's not F. Alternatively, maybe it's something like FCl or another fluorine compound. Wait, bright red color—maybe it's a fluorine-containing compound with a high oxidation state.

Wait, another thought: maybe A1 is ClF3? No, not sure. Or perhaps it's something else. Let's think about fluorine compounds that decompose to F2. Oh, wait, could it be a peroxide? Like, for example, if A1 is YF2O2 (though I'm not sure if that's a real compound). Alternatively, maybe it's a compound that upon decomposition releases F2, like perhaps YF4 → YF2 + F2? Not sure.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon can form various compounds, like XeO3 or XeF4. So if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, it might be F in a high oxidation state. For example, fluorine can be in various oxidation states. Maybe A1 is something like YF5, but wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think about known fluorine compounds. For example, ClF3 is a compound but I don't know its color. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a compound of F with another element that is a strong oxidizer.

Wait, another angle. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y in a 1:1 ratio. So A3 is YF. Or YF could be the formula. But if Y is a metal, YF might not be stable. Alternatively, perhaps YFl3 or another stoichiometry.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's say the decomposition equation is A1 → A2 + F2. So moles of F2 would be based on the stoichiometry.

Suppose A
