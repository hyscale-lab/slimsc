Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are from A to D, with different exponents on r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Like, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), but in parsecs, right? So plx (in arcseconds) is 1/d where d is in parsecs. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So we have N proportional to 1 / plx^5. Let me substitute plx in terms of d. Since plx = 1/d, let's plug that in.

So N ∝ 1 / ( (1/d) )^5 → which is 1 / (1/d)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. That would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of d. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, so maybe it's considering the differential, like the change in N with a small change in r (distance).

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think it's asking for the relationship between N and r, not the differential. Or maybe it's about the number density, how many stars are there per unit distance.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. If N is proportional to d^5, then for a given range of distance dr, the number of stars would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by dr, perhaps? Or maybe it's about the number per unit volume.

Wait, no, another approach: Let's think about how N relates to distance. The original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, and since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. So for
