Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that starspots are cooler regions, so when part of the star is covered by spots, the overall brightness (and hence Teff) would decrease, right? But in this case, the Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the star is dimmer overall. But I'm not sure how that affects the photospheric temperature. Maybe the problem is treating the average or something.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, in the stellar photosphere, when they look at the ratio of level 1 to level 2 Ti atoms, this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in two energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, in this problem, the star's photosphere is in LTE. So for each region, the temperature determines the Boltzmann factor. But when the star has spots, the overall photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So I guess the average temperature is lower. But how does that affect the ratio?

Wait, but the star's surface isn't uniformly at 5500 K when it has spots. Only 40% is covered by spots, which are cooler. So maybe the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature. But the question says the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I should model the star as a composite of two regions or think about the effective temperature in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the photosphere's temperature is now 5500 K on average. But I'm a bit confused. Because if 40% is covered by spots, the rest 60% is at 6000 K. How does that average out to 5500 K? Maybe it's considering the flux emitted. Since flux depends on the fourth power of temperature, the average flux would be a weighted average. But the effective temperature is the temperature of a black body that emits the same total flux as the star.

So the effective temperature when spots are present is 5500 K. So the star's total flux is that of a blackbody at 5500 K. But the unspotted regions are hotter, and the spotted are cooler.

Wait, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the important thing is the temperature of the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed. If the spots are cooler, but maybe the unspotted regions are at 6000 K. So when the star has spots, part of the photosphere is cooler (spots) and part is at 6000 K. But the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So maybe the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when the spots are present, but that doesn't make much sense because spots are cooler regions, not the entire photosphere.

Wait, perhaps the question is oversimplifying. Maybe it's considering the entire photosphere as being at the effective temperature
