Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

So, the question involves a series of reactions between different compounds, labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm. 8 equivalents is a lot, so maybe it's a 1:8 molar ratio. What's a solid reacting with a gas to form a red product? I'm thinking metals reacting with gases like chlorine or something. Wait, when solid sodium reacts with chlorine gas, they form NaCl, but that's white. Maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide? Or perhaps it's a reaction involving a more complex compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. If A is sodium and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents? Wait, sodium has a valency of +1, Cl2 is diatomic and each Cl is -1. So, for each Cl2 molecule, you need two Na atoms. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would require 16 equivalents (moles) of Na. But the ratio given is 8 B per 1 A. So A is maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum, which has a +3 charge. So reacting with Cl2, which is diatomic. The reaction would be 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. But that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Al. Hmm, but in this question, it's 8 equivalents of B per 1 A. So 1 A plus 8 B → product C. Let me think about possible reactions.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal oxide reacting with a gas like H2. For example, Fe3O4 reacting with H2. But that's a metal oxide reacting with hydrogen, which is a gas. The product would be the metal and water. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's leading anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal like copper reacting with sulfur vapor? Or perhaps it's a reaction that forms a compound with a high color. Bright red suggests maybe copper(II) something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. So when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, which is solid, and two acids. So C is likely a salt that's hydrolyzed in water to form the metal (A) and two acids.

Wait, so C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. So perhaps C is a salt composed of the cation from A and the anions from F and G. For example, if A is a metal, then C is a salt like M(NO3)2 or something, which when hydrolyzed gives the metal hydroxide (which might precipitate as A, but not sure) and nitric acid and another acid. Wait, but F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So F
