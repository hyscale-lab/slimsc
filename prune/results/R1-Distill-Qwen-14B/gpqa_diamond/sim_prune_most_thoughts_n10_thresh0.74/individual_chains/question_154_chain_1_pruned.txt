Okay, let's try to figure out what this compound is. So, the chemist found a white solid, and we've got some spectral data to work with. Hmm, let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the Mass Spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. That makes me think about the molecular formula. The main peak is M+, so molecular weight is 156. The other peak is 156 + 2, so maybe it's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has isotopes, with Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecule has one Cl, the molecular ion would have a certain isotopic pattern. Wait, but the main peak is 156, and the next is 158 (which is two more, fitting Cl-37's mass). But wait, Cl usually has about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So in a molecule with one Cl, the molecular ion would have a peak at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37), with an approximate 3:1 ratio. But here, the main peak is 100%, and 158 is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit exactly. Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, could it be deuterated or something else? Not sure yet. Let's move on and see what else we can find.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate either an -OH (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an amine (NH stretch). But wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a big clue. That's a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Also, the broad peak could be from an -OH stretch, which would suggest a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are usually broad. Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a peak around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H, but the IR here shows a broad peak, which doesn't fit as well with aldehydes. Also, looking at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) â€” that's a strong singlet. A singlet at around 11 ppm is usually a carboxylic acid proton because they are deshielded and split into a singlet when there's no adjacent H. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but this is higher, so maybe carboxylic acid. Another peak at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These look like two doublets that are each integrating to 2H. In aromatic regions, this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the
