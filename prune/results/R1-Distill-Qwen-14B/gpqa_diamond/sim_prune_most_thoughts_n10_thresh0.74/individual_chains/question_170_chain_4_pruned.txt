Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with components 3i and 4. 

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is given by ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

So first, let me write down the state ψ. It's (3i, 4) as a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Because (a + ib)* = a - ib. So if a=0 and b=3, then the conjugate is -3i. So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, no, wait. ψ is a column vector: 

ψ = [3i; 4], so ψ† is [3i*, 4*] as a row vector. 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4 because it's real. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Wait, no, wait. The components of the column vector are ψ_1 = 3i and ψ_2 =4. So ψ† is [ψ_1*, ψ_2* ] which is [ (3i)*, 4* ] = [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] and σ_y is the matrix, and ψ is [3i; 4]. So let's compute this step by step.
