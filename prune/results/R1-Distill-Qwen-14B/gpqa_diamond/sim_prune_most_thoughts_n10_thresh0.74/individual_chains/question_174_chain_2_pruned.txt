Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So, their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I think the key here is to use conservation of energy and momentum. But since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero as well. So, the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other out. That probably means their velocities are related inversely to their masses.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV. Oh wait, but we're going to deal with masses, so I might need to convert this to mass units. Since E=mc², but since all masses are in terms of M, maybe we can work with ratios.

- The two fragments: let's call their rest masses m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2. Or wait, is it the other way around? The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let me read that again: the more massive fragment is twice the other's rest mass. So, m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, and sum of m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But since m1 = 2 m2, substituting gives 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, that makes sense. So the two fragments have rest masses 0.33M and 0.66M.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M, but the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So there's a mass deficit of 0.01 M. That must be converted into kinetic energy and possibly other forms, but the problem says nothing else is produced—so the rest of the energy goes into kinetic energy of the two fragments.

So the total energy released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the sum of the rest mass energies of the fragments.

Wait, initial energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. After fission, the rest energy of the two fragments is (m1 + m2)c² = 0.99 M c². So the energy
