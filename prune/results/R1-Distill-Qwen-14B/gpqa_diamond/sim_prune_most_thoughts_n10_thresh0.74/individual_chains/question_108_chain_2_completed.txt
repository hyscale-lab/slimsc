Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom under certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the magnetic properties of particles like electrons, and it's related to how they interact with an external magnetic field.

The setup is that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Oh wait, Oz is the z-axis, right? So the field is pointing in the z-direction. The magnetic quantum number m is small, and B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value, ⟨H⟩, with the energy difference ΔE of a hydrogen atom transition that has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I think that's the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line or something like that.

First, I should probably find out what the transition energy ΔE is. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. Since energy is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ, I can calculate ΔE. Let me jot that down. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. So plugging in the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is approximately 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7. Let me do that division. 1.9878 / 4.861 is roughly 0.409, and exponents are 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18. So ΔE is about 0.409e-18 J. Converting that to electron volts might be easier because I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 0.409e-18 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV gives roughly 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think that refers to the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (which for electrons is about 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be μ_B * B * m multiplied by some factors. Wait, but since m is small, let's see.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the elementary charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the electron mass. The exact value is about 9.274e-24 J/T. So the paramagnetic energy term should be something like H = μ_B * B * m. But wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values like -1, 0, +1, etc., depending on the orbital. Since m is small, let's say m is about 1 for a p-orbital or s-orbital (like in hydrogen's 2p state).

So with B being 1 T, the paramagnetic term would be μ_B * B * m. Let's compute that. μ_B is ~9.274e-24 J/T. Multiply by B=1 T and m=1, so H = 9.274e-24 J. Wait, but that's in joules. Let me convert that to eV, since the ΔE I calculated was in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J is approximately (9.274e-24)/(1.602e-19) eV. Let me do that division: 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Now compare this with ΔE of 2.55 eV. Oh wow, the paramagnetic term is way smaller. 5.8e-5 eV is much less than 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ (which is the paramagnetic term) is much smaller than ΔE.

Looking back at the options: option C says ⟨H⟩ << ΔE. So that would be the correct choice. Option A says they're equal, but no way. Option B says ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, which isn't the case. Option D says it's bigger than, but again, no. So the answer should be C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom, we calculate both quantities and analyze their magnitudes.

### Step 1: Calculate the transition energy ΔE
The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 0.409 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{0.409 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment is given by \( \mu = -g \mu_B m \), where \( g \approx 2 \) is the Landé g-factor, \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number (assumed small, e.g., \( m = 1 \)). The energy is \( H = -\mu \cdot B \), so:

\[
\langle H \rangle = \mu_B B m.
\]

Substituting \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \), \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m = 1 \):

\[
\langle H \rangle = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \times 1 \times 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare ⟨H⟩ and ΔE
The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Thus, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).**
