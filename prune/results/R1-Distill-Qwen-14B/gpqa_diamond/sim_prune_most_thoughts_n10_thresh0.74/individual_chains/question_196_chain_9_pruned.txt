Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the equations of motion.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But since this is relativistic, I think we have to use the relativistic energy equations instead of the classical ones.

Relativistic energy includes the rest mass energy. The total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, right? Because the potential energy is (1/2)kx², so when x is maximum (A), PE is (1/2)kA².

But wait, in the relativistic scenario, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; I think the total energy must include the rest mass energy. So maybe E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. And also, the potential energy is part of the total energy. So the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. Or wait, no. In classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², and potential energy might be treated differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using the energy conservation in relativity. The maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but I'm not sure how that translates here.

Wait, another approach. The relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator might be more complicated. The classical equation is F = -
