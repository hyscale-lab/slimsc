Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem is about a series of reactions, and we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the shape and structure of molecules, right?

Let me break down the information given in the reactions.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. Since B is a gas and it's reacting in a 1:8 ratio, maybe B is something like O2 or another diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents might mean 8 moles, so the stoichiometry is 1 A : 8 B → 1 C.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous, which makes me think of something like a nerve agent or perhaps a highly reactive compound. But maybe I can figure it out based on the other reactions.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is like HCl (strong) and G is like H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, which is weak). Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 and G is something else, but I'm not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H, 1:1 ratio. H is a solvent, so maybe something like H2O (but B is a gas, D is a gas too?), or perhaps something else. Wait, D could be another gas reacting with B (like O2) to form H, which is a solvent.

Wait, let me think about possible candidates. Let's try to find out what each substance might be.

Starting with the first reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B. If B is O2, then maybe A is a metal that forms an oxide. For example, if A is iron, 8 equivalents of O2 would imply FeO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 because 8 H2 could react with something like Fe to form FeH2, but that's probably not bright red.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That's a key clue. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like Fe(OH)3 isn't red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal complex. Oh, wait, maybe C is lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's something like Fe2O4·nH2O or another oxide. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is Cl2, a gas. So, A reacts with 8 Cl2 to form C. But what would that product be? Maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state chloride. For instance, if A is copper, reacting with Cl2
