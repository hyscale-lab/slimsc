Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a crude peptidic compound. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the reason. So, the two peaks aren't due to coupling with neighboring protons. Hmm, what else could cause this?

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, the mass is the same, but there are two separate peaks. Since it's LC-MS, the peaks probably correspond to different compounds because the same mass wouldn't usually split into two without some other factor.

Wait, the options are about possible explanations. Let's look at each option:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If the crude compound had a precursor, the NMR would probably show different peaks, not the same alpha-proton. Also, LC-MS would show the precursor and the product as separate peaks. But the question says the LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected, so it's not the precursor. So maybe A is not the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images. In NMR, if the mixture is racemic (50/50), the alpha protons would be equivalent for each enantiomer, so you wouldn't see separate peaks. Wait, but in the NMR, maybe if the coupling is with the same type of protons, the splitting might be different? No, wait, no, enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because the environment is the same. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks. So B might not explain the NMR observation. Unless there's some diastereotopic issue, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about what 'double coupling' means. Maybe during the reaction, like when forming an amide, sometimes you can get some coupling issues. But how does that affect the NMR? If the amide protons are coupling, but the question says spin-spin is ruled out. So maybe this isn't the reason.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would appear as separate peaks in NMR and in LC-MS. In the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But wait, the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. How so? If the compound is a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have the same number of protons but different environments. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton might be split into different shifts. Like, if you have two diastereomers, each with their own alpha-proton environment, you'd see two separate peaks for the same proton in each structure. But the integrals together add to 1H, which suggests each peak is about half a proton, which doesn't make sense because each diastereomer would have one proton each. Oh wait, if the mixture is 50/50, each diastereomer contributes one proton, so the total integral would be 2H. But the question says the integral together is 1H. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks with similar shifts and roughly equal integrals adding to 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H. That doesn't align with diastereomers because each would have a full H. Unless the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, but each contributes a certain number of protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of epimers, which are diastereomers differing only in the configuration of one stereocenter. So if the compound has two diastereomers, each with the same number of protons but different shifts. For example, if the alpha-proton is in a different environment, maybe like being adjacent to different groups. Then, each diastereomer would have their own alpha-proton peak. So in the NMR, each would contribute their own peak, and if they're in equal amounts, the integral of each would be half, adding to 1H. That makes sense. So in that case, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton, each with about 0.5H. And the LC-MS would pick up two peaks because the diastereomers have the same mass but are separated on the column. So option D seems plausible.

Wait, but why would the mass spectrum be the same? Oh, because diastereomers have the same molecular formula, so same mass. So that fits with the LC-MS data. So the same mass, but different structures, leading to two peaks in LC-MS.

So putting it all together: NMR shows two peaks for the same proton (so same structure but different environments, like diastereomers), and LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Looking back at the options, option D is that.


The question involves analyzing a crude peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding to 1H), and no evidence of spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
  If the crude compound were contaminated with a precursor, the LC-MS would show two distinct masses (one for the precursor and one for the product). However, the question specifies that both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out contamination with a precursor. Thus, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
  Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical NMR spectra because the chemical environment of the protons is the same. Therefore, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would not produce two separate peaks for the same alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum. This explanation does not account for the observed NMR data, making this option implausible.

- **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
  'Double coupling' refers to a phenomenon where protons couple with two different sets of neighboring protons. However, the question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, this explanation does not account for the two distinct peaks observed in the LC-MS spectrum. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

- **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
  Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, meaning they have different physical and chemical properties. In the NMR spectrum, each diastereomer would produce its own set of peaks due to differences in the chemical environment of the protons. If the mixture is 50/50, the integrals of the two peaks for the same alpha-proton would each be approximately 0.5H, adding up to 1H, which matches the NMR data. The LC-MS data also aligns with this explanation because diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, but they can be separated on a chromatographic column, producing two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This explanation accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations, making it the most likely answer.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation for the observed data is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
