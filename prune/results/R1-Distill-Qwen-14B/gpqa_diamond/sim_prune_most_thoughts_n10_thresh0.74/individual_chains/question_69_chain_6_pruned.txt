Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. 

The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy of the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A through D, each with different resolutions.

Wait, I think I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime would be longer than τ₀.

The first thing I need to figure out is the velocity of the X⁰ particle. Because the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the rest frame, but when moving, the lifetime increases by gamma, which is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). 

So the lifetime observed, τ, is gamma multiplied by τ₀. But how does that relate to the distance the particle travels before decaying? Oh right, the distance L is v multiplied by τ, which is v multiplied by gamma tau_0.

But wait, what's the velocity of X⁰? Since X⁰ is moving in the bubble chamber with energy E =27 GeV, and its mass m is 3.41 GeV. I think the total energy is related to the rest mass and the kinetic energy. So E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, the energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy, right? So E = gamma * m c². So gamma would be E / (m c²). But since units are in GeV, maybe I can ignore c² because in natural units, c=1.

So gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / (3.41 GeV) = approximately 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is about 7.915. So gamma is approximately 7.915.

So the lifetime observed is gamma * tau_0. So tau = gamma * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.915 * 8e-16 = approximately 6.332e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the energy is 27 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E - m c²? Or is the given energy the total? I think in particle physics, when they say "energy in the Bubble Chamber", that's the total energy of the particle. So yes, E is the total energy.

But I'm proceeding under that assumption. So moving on.

So the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0 ≈ 7.915 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.332e-15 s.

Now, the particle is moving at a velocity v. What's v? Since gamma is 7.915, I can find beta (v/c) using gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute beta.

Gamma squared is (7.915)^2 ≈ 62.65. So 1 - beta² = 1/(gamma²) = 1/62.65 ≈ 0.016. So beta² = 1 - 0.016 = 0.984, so beta ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.99197. So v ≈ 0.99197 c, which is approximately 0.992c.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * tau. So L = 2.976e8 m/s * 6.332e-15 s. Let me compute that.

2.976e8 * 6.332e-15 = (2.976 * 6.332) * 1e-7. Let's compute 2.976 *6.332. 3*6 is 18, but more accurately:

2.976 *6.332: Let's see, 2 *6.332=12.664, 0.976 *6.332 ≈ 6.192. So sum is about 12.664 +6.192=18.856. So 18.856e-7 meters, which is 1.8856e-6 meters, or approximately 1.886e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So what does that mean?

Wait, I think I need to relate the resolution of the detector to the distance the particle travels. The idea is that if the detector can resolve
