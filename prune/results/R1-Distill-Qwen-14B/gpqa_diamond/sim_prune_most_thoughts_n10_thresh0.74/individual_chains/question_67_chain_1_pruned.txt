Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, wait. Wait, electrons have spin too, but the question says to ignore spin. Hmm, so we're only considering their orbital angular momentum here. Interesting.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Oh right, I remember that when you combine two angular momenta, the total angular momentum quantum number l is the sum of l1 and l2. So in this case, l1 is 1 and l2 is 1, so their sum can be 0, 1, or 2. But here, it's 2, so that makes sense.

So, the state is |l1=1, l2=1, total l=2, m=-1>. Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron and finding the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum eigenvalues for Lz are mħ, right? Because Lz |l, m> = m ħ |l, m>. So for each electron, their Lz eigenvalues would be m1 ħ and m2 ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron's orbital.

But in this coupled state, the total m is -1. So the total m is m1 + m2. Because when you add two angular momenta, the total m is the sum of individual m's. So here, the total m is -1.

Wait, so m1 + m2 = -1. And the question is asking for the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because if each L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ, that corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because eigenvalue is m ħ. So m1 and m2 are each -1.

So, in this state |1,1,2,-1>, what is the probability of m1 = -1 and m2 = -1?

But wait, the coupled state
