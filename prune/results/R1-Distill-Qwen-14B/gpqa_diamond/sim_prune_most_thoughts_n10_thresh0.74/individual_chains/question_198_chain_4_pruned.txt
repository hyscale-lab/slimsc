Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The problem gives me the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN- ions, and the stability constants for the complexes they form. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. Let me start by recalling what stability constants mean. The stability constant (β) is a measure of the equilibrium of a complex. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, those β values are for the complexes Co(SCN)_n^2+ where n is 1,2,3,4?

So the complexes would be Co(SCN)^(2+), Co(SCN)_2^(2+), Co(SCN)_3^(2+), and Co(SCN)_4^(2+). The β values are for each step. Oh wait, wait. No, I think the β's are the overall stability constants for each complex. So β1 is for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Co(II) is Co^2+. So each SCN- is a ligand. Each addition of SCN- forms a new complex. So:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ CoSCN^+ → β1 = 9
CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^(2+) → β2 =40
Co(SCN)_2^(2+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_3^(3+) → β3=63
Co(SCN)_3^(3+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_4^(4+) → β4=16

Wait, but wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the charge. Because Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So when you have n SCN- attached, the charge is 2 - n. So the complexes would have charges as follows:

n=1 → CoSCN^+ (2+ -1 = +1)
n=2 → Co(SCN)_2^(0), because 2-2=0
n=3 → Co(SCN)_3^- (2-3= -1)
n=4 → Co(SCN)_4^2- (2-4= -2)

Wait, but the problem statement says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for the formation of the next complex.

Wait, maybe I should model the formation step by step.
