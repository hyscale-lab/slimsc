Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles... right, like electrons. I remember that their spin is quantized and can have two possible states. The problem says the particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

Alright, let me read the problem again. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned. So the magnetic field is B in the +Z direction. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Wait, so the field switches from Z to Y. Interesting.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. Oh, so after the field changes, the average <mu_z> starts oscillating. I need to find the frequency of these oscillations.

Hmm, I think this has to do with how the spin precesses in the new magnetic field. When the magnetic field changes direction, the spin doesn't just instantly align with it; instead, it precesses. Precession leads to oscillations in the components of the spin.

Wait, initially, the particle was in the +Z direction. When the field switches to +Y, the spin is suddenly not aligned. So the state of the spin doesn't change instantaneously, but the magnetic field does. So the spin state is an eigenstate of Sz, but the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, I think.

The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Initially, n was along +Z, so H was proportional to S_z. After the switch, n is along +Y, so H becomes proportional to S_y.

But wait, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z before the field changes. So after the field changes, the state isn't an eigenstate of H anymore. That's when time evolution starts, leading to precession.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So I need to find the time dependence of <S_z>.

When the Hamiltonian is proportional to S
