Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, electrons, positrons, photons... Oh right, it's about particle physics and maybe some relativity involved. Let me start breaking it down.

The problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So for the electron, gamma is 4, so v_e is such that gamma_e =4. Similarly, gamma_p =2 for the positron, moving from the right.

I need to find the properties of the photons. Since they annihilate, their total energy and momentum must be conserved.

But wait, the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions. Let me think about their energies and momenta.

Electron:
Gamma_e =4. The rest mass of an electron is m_e. So the total energy of the electron is gamma_e * m_e * c². The momentum p_e is gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2), maybe I can express v in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, I remember that for a particle, p = gamma m v. And since gamma = 1/sqrt(1-v²/c²), we can write v as c² (p² c² + m² c^4 )^(-1/2) * p. Hmm, maybe that's too complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitudes of their momenta. Let's denote the electron's velocity as v_e, positron's as v_p.

Electron:
gamma_e =4 ⇒ 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_e/c)^2) ⇒ sqrt(1 - (v_e/c)^2) = 1/4 ⇒ 1 - (v_e²/c²) = 1/16 ⇒ (v_e²/c²)=15/16 ⇒ v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ (3.872)/4 c ≈ 0.968c.

Similarly, positron's gamma_p =2 ⇒ gamma_p=2 ⇒ v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_p)^2) c. So sqrt(1-1/4)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2. So v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866c.

Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite to the electron. Let me take the electron's direction as positive, so the positron is moving with velocity -v_p (since from the right, towards the left? Wait, no. Wait, the question says the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving from the left (which
