Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when we talk about the photosphere of a star and excitation of atoms, it's related to the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that each small region of the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at a particular temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 in a specific energy level. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I'm supposed to find the correct equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation! It relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states. The equation is (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this case, the higher energy level is more excited, so n2 is the number of atoms in the excited state. The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, so n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2)? Or wait, noâ€”wait, maybe I should clarify. The question says that the excitation is twice as much. So if for star_2, the ratio is X, for star_1 it's 2X. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no: the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. So the population in the higher energy level (n2) is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or some lower state) is higher. So for star_1, (n2_1 / n1_1) is higher. But wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much, so I think that (n_high / n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because if star_1 is hotter, the excitation would be higher.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The problem
