Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Since β is 1/(kT), that should come into play.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I remember that for each state, I need to calculate the energy and then add up the exponentials of β times that energy.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. I think the energy term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is symmetric, so perhaps I can group the states by how many pairs are aligned (S_i S_j =1) or anti-aligned (S_i S_j =-1).

Wait, each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 otherwise. So for each pair, I get +1 or -1. The energy is -J multiplied by the sum of these terms.

Let me think about all possible cases. The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can have different values depending on how many pairs are aligned.

What are the possible values of the sum?

Each term can be +1 or -1. So the sum can range from 3 (all +1) to -3 (all -1). But wait, let's think about how many possible combinations lead to each sum.

Wait, let me list all possible combinations. Or maybe think about the number of pairs that are aligned.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to consider the possible values. Let's think about each possible case.

Case 1: All three spins are the same. So S1 = S2 = S3. Then each S_i S_j is +1. So the sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

How many such states are there? Two: all +1, or all -1. So degeneracy is 2.

Case 2:
