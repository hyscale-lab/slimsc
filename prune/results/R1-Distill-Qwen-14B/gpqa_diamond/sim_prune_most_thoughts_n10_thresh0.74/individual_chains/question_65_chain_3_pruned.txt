Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The problem has two parts, reactions A and B, and there are four options to choose from. The question involves considering different reaction conditions to determine the major products.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is a strong base. Wait, KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. Oh, but in this case, maybe it's used as a base, but sometimes in certain conditions, it's used for elimination or deprotonation.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So it's a nine-membered spiro compound with a five-membered and a four-membered ring? Wait, no, spiro[m.n] means m and n are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5] would have a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the same carbon. And there's a double bond at position 5, so maybe between C5 and C6. And a vinyl group attached at position 1.

Wait, the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro has a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring, connected at the same carbon. The 1-vinyl group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So the structure would be a spiro ring where the central carbon has a hydroxyl and a vinyl group attached.

When this compound is treated with KH in THF followed by H+, what happens? I think that in such conditions, the hydroxyl group is deprotonated. But wait, is there an acidic proton here? The hydroxyl is on a spiro compound, which might make it more acidic due to the ring strain or conjugation.

Deprotonation of the hydroxyl would give an alkoxide. Then, under basic conditions, maybe an elimination reaction occurs. But what kind of elimination? Since it's a sp
