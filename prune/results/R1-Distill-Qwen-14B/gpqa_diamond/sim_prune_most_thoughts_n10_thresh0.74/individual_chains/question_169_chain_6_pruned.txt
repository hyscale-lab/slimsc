Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is about how the E spectrum changes.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, when particles are emitted, their energy distributions depend on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Since the E particles' spectrum is continuous, that suggests that there's a distribution of energies they can take. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy each E can have, right? So the E particles' energies go up to Q but can be less.

Now, in the variant, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M. M is massless, so it's like a photon or something. Wait, but how does changing the number and type of emitted particles affect the E spectrum?

In the original case, the decay emits 2V. Let's assume V has some rest mass. In the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M which is massless. So perhaps the change affects the available energy and the possible energy each E can have.

Wait, but the conservation of energy and momentum must hold. In the original decay, the two E's and two V's carry away energy and momentum. Now, in the variant, two E's and an M are emitted.

I think the key here is to look at the Q-value of the decay, which is the total energy released. In the original case, the maximum energy occurs when the E's are emitted with maximum energy. But in the variant, since the decay products are different, the Q might change, which would affect the endpoint.

Wait, but the problem says the original decay has a known total energy spectrum for E. So the maximum energy (endpoint) is Q. How does the variant change this?

Hmm. So, when the decay is 2A → 2B + 2
