Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine is a diatomic molecule, Br₂, and it's often involved in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. But wait, wait, the compound here is a cyclopentenol, right? So it's a cyclopentene ring with an alcohol group.

Wait, cyclopent-1-enol means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the hydroxyl group is at position 1? Or maybe position 1 is the double bond. Let me think. The structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol would have a cyclopentane ring where one of the double bonds is at position 1 (between C1 and C2), and there's an -OH group attached to C1. Additionally, there are two methyl groups on C4.

So when bromine reacts with an alkene, usually it's an addition reaction. Alkenes can undergo bromination via an electrophilic addition. Since this molecule has a conjugated dienol structure? Wait, no, it's just a cyclopentenol. So the reaction would probably be adding Br₂ across the double bond.

But wait, there's an OH group attached. So the structure is similar to cyclohexenol or something. So when brom
