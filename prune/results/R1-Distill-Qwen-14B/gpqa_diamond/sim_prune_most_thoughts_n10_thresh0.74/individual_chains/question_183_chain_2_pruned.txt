Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure is a cyclohexene ring, right? So cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with one double bond. The positions are numbered 1 through 6. 

Looking at the substituents: at position 2, there's a formyl group (-CHO). And at position 5, there's a vinyl group (-CH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so maybe it's attached as a substituent. Oh wait, no: wait, 5-vinyl means the substituent is a vinyl group attached at position 5. So the structure is a cyclohexene with a vinyl group at C5 and a formyl group at C2.

Wait, I should probably draw this out mentally. So the ring has double bonds? Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between C3 and C4. So positions 3 and 4 are double-bonded.

So the molecule is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at C2 and C5. C2 has a formyl group (CHO), and C5 has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), maybe attached as a substituent on the ring.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no. Wait, the Wolff-Kishner is for eliminating carbonyl groups, like converting ketones or aldehydes into methylene groups. But wait, red phosphorus and HI might be for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of addition?

Wait, no. Another reaction comes to mind. When alkenes react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's typically for the hydrohalogenation, but wait, maybe more accurately, it's for the addition of HI across double bonds. But wait, when HI is used with red phosphorus, it's often for the formation of the phosphorus ylide, which then does a Wittig reaction. Wait
