Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, okay. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, I think. It's used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions.

So the starting material here is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers, right? Because it's an alkene with a stereogenic center? Let me think about the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw the structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait. The double bond is at position 1, so structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-something? Wait, no, maybe I should write it more carefully.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let's count the carbons.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So when it's 3-methyl, the methyl is on the third carbon of the pentene. Let me number the chain.

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2 (since double bond is between 1 and 2)
Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should draw the structure correctly.

Wait, the full structure: 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. The double bond starts at carbon 1, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, wait, maybe another approach. Let's number the carbons from the double bond. So for pent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, if it
