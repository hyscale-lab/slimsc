Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of surfaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the form. 

Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric is similar to the hyperbolic space. The standard metric for a pseudosphere has terms with negative signs or something. But wait, the metric here seems to involve 4 - x² - y² in the denominator. Let me see.

So the metric is written in terms of flat coordinates, maybe like polar coordinates? Wait, x and y are Cartesian here, not necessarily polar. Because in the standard case, the metric for a sphere is (dx² + dy²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/R²) or something like that. But wait, for hyperbolic space, I think the metric is (dx² + dy²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/R²), maybe? I'm not exactly sure about the sign.

Wait, the general form for 2D hyperbolic space in the Poincaré disk model is ds² = (4/(R²(1 - r²)^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in polar coordinates. Here, the metric is in Cartesian
