Alright, so I've got this question about density matrices in quantum computing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Okay, the question gives me a density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are vectors in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because qubits are two-level systems, so maybe this has to do with the Bloch sphere representation?

Wait, right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does that relate to the density matrix given here?

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me rewrite that in terms of matrix form to see it better. The |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 0.5.

Wait, what does this represent? I remember that a density matrix for a mixed state can be represented as a statistical mixture. If it's a completely mixed state, like this one, it's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because each outcome (|0> and |1>) is equally probable, and there's no coherence—off-diagonal terms are zero.

In the Bloch sphere, the maximally mixed state would be at the origin, right? Because it's the center point, equidistant from all possible pure states. So the state vector would be (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which I think corresponds to the state |1> if it were pure, but since this is a mixed state, it's not on the surface. Option A is (1,1,0), which I'm not familiar with, but maybe that's for a different state. Option D is (1,1,1), which seems off since the Bloch vector is usually in 3D with components (x,y,z), but a qubit is a two-state system so the vector lies on the surface of a unit sphere. Wait, but the density matrix being rank 1 (a pure state) would have the vector on the sphere's surface. If it's a mixed state, the vector's length is less than or equal to 1. 

But wait, the density matrix here is diagonal with 0.5 on both diagonals. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So I need to compare this with the given ρ.

Let's compute (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1
