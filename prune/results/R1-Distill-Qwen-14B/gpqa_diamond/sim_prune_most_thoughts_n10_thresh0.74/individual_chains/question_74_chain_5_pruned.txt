Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an atom with a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Then, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law, which is memoryless. That means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the decay process is independent of the past; the atom's "memory" doesn't affect its future decay. 

Wait, but in the problem, they're telling us that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe I should model this using the decay constant.

The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but here they're giving a probability over a certain time. So the formula for the probability of decay (P) within time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that. So P = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that P is 32% (which is 0.32) when t is 100 minutes. Let me write that equation:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Taking natural logs on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Calculating ln(0.68)... let's think, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931. What's ln(0.68) approximately? Maybe around -0.385 or so? Let me check: e^(-0.385) is about 0.68. Yeah, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait: the next 150 minutes—so is that from time 50 to 200 minutes? Or do they mean 150 minutes from now, so until 50+150=200?

Yes, that's correct. So the time after the current point is 150 minutes.

But because of the memoryless property, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not on how long it's been already. So the probability is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, no! Wait
