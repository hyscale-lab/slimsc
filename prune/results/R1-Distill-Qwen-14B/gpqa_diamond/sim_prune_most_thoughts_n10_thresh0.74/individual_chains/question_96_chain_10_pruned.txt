Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. Hmm, right, entropy for a black hole is something to do with the area of its event horizon, right? I remember the formula is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area. Oh wait, and k is Boltzmann's constant, G is the gravitational constant, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. 

But wait, the problem gives me the angular size θ. So I think I need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Angular size relates to the actual size through the distance. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (radius) / (distance), assuming small angles where θ is in radians. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first.

Let me jot down the given values. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters. The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let
