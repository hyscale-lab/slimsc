Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the answer choices are A to D, each selecting one of these. So I need to figure out each option's density and pick the highest.

Let me list out each option:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth, which I know has a density around 5.5 g/cm³. Because Earth's average density is about that, yeah.

b) 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth but more mass. Hmm, but density is mass over volume. If the mass increases but the density stays the same, then the volume must also increase. So maybe this planet is larger in radius than Earth.

c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density? Because composition affects density. If it's more massive, but same density, then the radius would be larger. Because mass = density × volume, and volume depends on radius cubed.

d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density. Less mass, so smaller radius. Because if M = density × (4/3 π r³), then for same density, M is proportional to r³.

Wait, but the question is about the highest density. So for each option, I need to find the density.

Option a: same as Earth's, so 5.5.

Option b: given as 5.5. So same as a.

Option c: same composition as Earth, so same density as a and b, which is 5.5.

Option d: same composition, so same density.

Wait, that can't be right. Because all options a, b, c, d have the same density? But that's not possible because the options are multiple-choice. So I must have misunderstood.

Wait, wait. Let me re-read the options.

Option b: "A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³." So the density is given as 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density. So yes, 5.5.

Option d: same composition, so density 5.5.

Option a: same as Earth, 5.5.

Wait, so all options have the same density? But that can't be, because the question is about which has the highest. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are not all same composition. Let me look again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So same composition as Earth.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So same as Earth's density.

Option c: same composition as Earth, so same density, but 5 times more massive.

Option d: same composition, so same density, half mass.

So all have same density, 5.5. But that can't be, because the question is asking for the highest. Then perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check again.
