Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for a while already. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed, which means a 68% chance it hasn't. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait—next 150 after the initial 50 or after the 100? Let me read the question again.

Oh, right, so 50 minutes have passed since we started monitoring, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but that would be adding 150 minutes to the initial 50, making a total of 200 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes from now, making it 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total? Or is it the next 150 minutes beyond the initial 100? Hmm. I think the way it's worded, "next 150 minutes," it probably refers to the remaining time after the initial 50. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, the original statement is a bit confusing. The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that implies that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed. So the decay is a 32% chance in 100 minutes. But if we wait longer, the probability should increase.

But wait, decay probabilities are based on half-lives, right? Or is it an exponential decay model where the probability of decay in a certain time is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time.

So, the decay follows an exponential law. The key here is that radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend
