Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that someone synthesized a small peptidic compound. They ran the 1H NMR and found that most of the peaks match what they expected. But there are two peaks that are both alpha-protons and have similar chemical shifts. Also, their integrals add up to 1H, so they're not splitting each other. Plus, the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling. So what's going on there?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the mass spec is the same, which suggests they're the same molecule, but maybe different forms.

Possible options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if the NMR shows extra peaks, the precursor would have a different structure, so the NMR would probably show different peaks. And in the LC-MS, if it's a precursor, its mass would be different. But the question says the mass spectrum is the same, so this might not fit. So maybe A is not the right choice.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In the NMR, if there's a mixture, you might see splitting if the two enantiomers have different coupling. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar shifts. Wait, in a racemic mixture, for a proton that's chiral, each enantiomer would have a different shift. But in the case of an alpha-proton in a peptide, if the environment is the same for both enantiomers, maybe they'd resonate at the same shift. Hmm, but wait, no, because the alpha-proton would be in different environments if the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, maybe if the protons are equivalent in some way, like if they're both in equivalent environments in each enantiomer. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Also, in the NMR, if the molecule is a racemic mix, the peaks might not split because the two enantiomers have the same environment for that proton? Or maybe the peaks would be a doublet if coupling occurs between the two. But the problem says the integrals add up to 1H, so maybe that's a clue. Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are due to two different diastereomers, but I'll get to that.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling might refer to some sort of coupling beyond normal J coupling. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So maybe C isn't the right answer.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If there are two diastereomers, the same alpha-proton could have two different environments, leading to two distinct peaks. Since the integrals add up to 1H, maybe each is 0.5H. But wait, the problem says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Diastereomers might have slightly different shifts, but if they're similar, maybe it's possible. Also, in the LC-MS, if the two isomers have the same mass (since same molecular formula), that would give two peaks of same mass but different in another way, but the question says the mass spectrum matches the expected. Wait, but diastereomers would have same molecular weight, so in mass spec (like LC-MS), they'd appear as separate peaks with same mass.

So putting it together: The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, similar shifts, same integral. So for each diastereomer, the proton's environment is slightly different, so two signals. But if it's a racemic mixture (enantiomers), that would cause two signals as well. Wait, but in a racemic mixture, for a chiral center, the protons would have the same shift as each other? No, wait, if the molecule is chiral and it's a racemic mix, the two enantiomers would have the same NMR shifts because the environment is the same for each proton in each enantiomer. Wait no, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Suppose the molecule has a chiral center, and the alpha-proton is on a chiral carbon. Each enantiomer would have the same chemical environment for that proton, so in an NMR, a racemic mixture would just give
