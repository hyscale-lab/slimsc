Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to figure out all the possible states and their corresponding energies.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll list them all out. Maybe it's easier to find each state's energy and then sum up the exponential terms.

Wait, but how do the spins contribute to the energy? The energy depends on the product of each pair. Let me think: for each pair S_i S_j, if they are the same, their product is +1, and if different, -1. Because S_i and S_j can each be ±1.

So the energy E is -J times the sum of the three pair products. So E = -J [ (S1S2) + (S1S3) + (S2S3) ].

Each of the terms S1S2, etc., can be either +1 or -1. So the sum inside the brackets can range from -3 to +3, perhaps?

Wait, let me think. Let's calculate each possible state.

There are 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

State 1: all spins +1.
Each product is 1, so sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, E = -J*(sum). So sum is -1, so E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no: sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. E = J, same as state 2.

State 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = J.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate:

In state 4: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (1)(-1) = -1.
S1S3 = (1)(-1) = -1.
S2S3 = (-1)(-1) =1.
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1. So E = J.

Hmm, same for these states.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.
S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1.
S1S3 = (-1)(1) = -1.
S2S3 = (1)(1) =1.
Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, same as before. So states 2,3,4,5 all have sum -1 and E= J.

Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me check state 6.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.
S1S
