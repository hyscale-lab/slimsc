Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. There are four identical spin-1/2 particles, and I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are A to D, each with different combinations of multiples of E. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is given as E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit (E = π²ħ²/(2mL²)). So each particle's energy depends on their quantum number n.

But wait, there are four identical particles. Since they're spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That principle says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system. So each particle must have a unique quantum state.

In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since the particles are spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, we can have two particles with opposite spins.

Let me think about how to arrange the four particles. The ground state would be the lowest energy possible. Since each n can hold two particles (because of spin), the first level (n=1) can hold two particles, n=2 can hold two, and so on.

Wait, but wait. Since particles are spin-1/2, for each n, two particles can occupy the same n but different spins. So, for four particles, the first two would go into n=1 (spin up and down), the next two would have to go into higher n.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the ground state would have the lowest possible energies. So the first two particles with n=1 (each with opposite spins), then the next two would go into the next available n. What's the next available? Since each n can only hold two, the next would be n=2 and n=3? No, wait, no. Oh, wait, no, because for four particles, the first two are in n=1, and the next two must go into n=2. Because n=2 can hold two particles as well.

Wait, no, because n=2 is a higher energy level. Let me think again. Each particle must have a unique state. Ground state would be the lowest energies possible. So for four fermions, each with spin 1/2, the filling would be as follows: n=1 can have two particles (each with opposite spins). Then n=2 can take two more (opposite spins each). So all four particles are filled up to n=2.

Wait, but that only uses n=1 and n=2. Because each n can have 2 particles. So four particles
