Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. So, I remember that Grubbs is a ring-closing metathesis catalyst, but it can also do other types of metathesis reactions, like cross-metathesis. Wait, but in this case, since we have a single alkene, maybe it's undergoing ring-closing metathesis or possibly a ring-opening if it's a cyclic structure. Wait, wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, that's not right. Let me count again. Pent has five carbons. So positions 1 to 5.

So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh, wait, no. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Pent-1-ene: 1 2 3 4 5. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the substituents are on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene? So the formula would be C6H12? Wait, no, wait. Let me count again.

Pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in a row. So C1 is CH2-, C2 is CH-, C3 is CH(CH
