Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to tackle it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, from NMR, I know that triplets and quartets indicate splitting due to neighboring protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests that these protons are probably on a methyl group adjacent to another set of protons. The quartet at 1.3 ppm with 4H could be a methylene group (-CH2-) next to another CH2.

Wait, 6H as a triplet... I'm thinking maybe two methyl groups, each with three H. Like, maybe two -CH2CH3 groups? Or perhaps a single -CH2CH2CH3 group? But wait, no, because the triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. Let me think: a triplet for 6H implies maybe two sets of three H each, each adjacent to a group with two H. So perhaps two isopropyl groups? No, wait, isopropyl groups have a central CH and two CH3, but their coupling would give a septet maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Wait another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies splitting into four, so likely each of these protons is next to a CH2 group. Like, maybe a -CH2CH2- group. But 4H as a quartet... that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative with two substituents. Or perhaps a diethyl group? Because diethyl ether has two ethyl groups, but that would have a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. Wait, but in that case, the ethyl groups would each have triplet for CH3 (from adjacent CH2) and quartet for CH2 (from adjacent CH3). So in diethyl ether, the NMR would show a quartet for the CH2 and triplet for CH3. But here, the quartet is for 4H, which would be two CH2 groups, each with two H
