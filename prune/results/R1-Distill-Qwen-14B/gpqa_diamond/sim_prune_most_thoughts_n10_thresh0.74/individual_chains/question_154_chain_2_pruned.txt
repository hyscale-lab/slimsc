Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we need to figure out what it is based on the spectral data. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, wait, the molecular ion is the parent peak, so the molecular weight is 156. The peak at 158 is probably a fragment or an isotope. Since the molecular weight is 156, the molecule must have a molecular formula that adds up to that. Let me think about possible candidates.

Looking at the IR data, there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad peak because they can dimerize via hydrogen bonds, right? Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That area is typically a carbonyl group. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1, maybe a bit higher if it's an acid derivative. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid or an ester or something like that.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). The singlet at 11 ppm is very downfield. That's a strong indicator of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid because the acidic proton would be around there. Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, wouldn't the proton appear as a broad peak? But in the spectrum, it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's exchange with D2O or something, but perhaps it's a deprotonated carboxylic acid? Or maybe it's another functional group.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but this is 11, which is a bit higher. Wait, unless it's an aromatic aldehyde or something. Or maybe it's a phenolic OH? But phenols are usually less downfield than 11. Wait, phenols are around 5-7, maybe. So 11 ppm is more likely a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde. Hmm, but wait, the aldehyde would be a singlet as well, but in the NMR, the integration is 1H. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -OH as a broad peak, but in the given data, it's a singlet. Maybe it's a different group.

Wait, maybe it's a chloroformate. Chloroformate has the structure Cl-CO-O-R. Oh, but wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more like an ester or acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl with an electron-withdrawing group.

Looking at the NMR again. The two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm with 2H each suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe it's something like para-substituted benzene with two substituents. So, the protons are in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So if the molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring, one at position 2 and the other at position 4, but wait, para is positions 1 and 3? No, wait, para is opposite positions, like 1 and 4. So perhaps two substituents at the para positions. Hmm, but wait, that would only be one substituent? Wait, no, if it's a disubstituted benzene ring, para would have substituents in positions 1, 2, and 4? No, wait, para is 1,4 positions. If you have two substituents, maybe that would be 1 and 3, but that's meta, or 1 and 4, para. Wait, but in the NMR, each doublet has two H, which suggests that the substituents are in positions that split the ring into two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think about the options. The options are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic
