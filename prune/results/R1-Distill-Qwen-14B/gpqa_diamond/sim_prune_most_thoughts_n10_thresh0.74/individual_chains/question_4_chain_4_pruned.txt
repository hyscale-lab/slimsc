Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, that's a bit different from what I know. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both a north and south pole; you can't have a single isolated pole. That's why, in Maxwell's equations, certain things are the way they are. So, the question is about how Maxwell's equations would change if isolated poles existed.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall each one:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This relates the electric field to the charge density. I don't think this one would change because it's about electric fields and charges, not magnetic.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0. Oh, right! This equation states that there are no isolated magnetic charges because the divergence of B is zero. So if in this parallel universe, you can have isolated magnetic poles, then this equation must change. Instead of zero, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, like ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So that equation would definitely be different.

3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This relates changing magnetic fields to electric fields. I don't think this equation changes because it's about the induced electric fields due to changing B fields, and the existence of isolated poles might not directly affect this. Or wait, maybe I should think again. No, because this law is about the curl of E and the time derivative of B. If the B field's divergence is now non-zero, does that impact Faraday's law? I don't think so because Faraday's law deals with the curl, not the divergence. So maybe Faraday's law stays the same.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. This is about the curl of the magnetic field relating to current and displacement current. In our universe, this holds, and it's tied to the idea that magnetic monopoles don't exist. If magnetic monopoles do exist, would Ampère's law change? Or would it stay the same? Wait, Ampère's law as we know it comes from the absence of magnetic current. If monopoles exist, perhaps there's a magnetic current, so maybe an extra term would appear.

Wait, no. Ampère's law in Maxwell's equations is about the curl of H being equal to the sum of the conduction current and the displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Ampère's law? Or would it affect the other equations more?

Wait, let's think about the structure. In the case of magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations would have both electric and magnetic charges. So, the divergence of B would not be zero anymore, which is the Gauss's law for magnetism. The other equations might have additional terms.

Wait, let me recall. Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles would have two additional terms: one for the divergence of B and another for the curl of E. Because when you have magnetic charges, you have to modify both Gauss's law for B and Faraday's law. Oh wait, was it Faraday's law that changes? Because Faraday's law is about the curl of E. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think again.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would not be zero. So, equation 2 changes. Also, Faraday's law would have an additional term because of the magnetic current. Because in Maxwell's equations, to include magnetic monopoles, you need to modify both the divergence of B and the curl of E.

Wait, without magnetic monopoles, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (if ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). Also, equation 3 would get an extra term. Because Faraday's law would include the magnetic current. So equation 3 becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. 

So which of Maxwell's equations are different in this scenario? Both equation 2 (divergence of B) and equation 3 (curl of E) change.

Wait, the question is about which equations are different. The options are about which equations in Maxwell's set are altered.

Looking at the options:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So equation 2 changes. But equation 3 also changes, so this would only be part of the change, not all.

Option B) The ones
