Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of these compounds, which suggests that Y has a valency that allows for multiple oxidation states. Fluorine usually has a -1 charge, so Y must have different positive charges to form multiple compounds.

The problem mentions several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. Let me try to parse each clue.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition produces A2, where ωF is 31.96%. Wait, ωF is the weight percent of fluorine. So, let's calculate what that could mean.

If A2 is a binary compound, then its formula would be YFₓ. The weight percent of fluorine is 31.96%. Let me think: fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So, suppose YFₓ has a formula where the fluorine contributes 31.96% of the total mass.

Let me set up an equation. Let the molecular weight of Y be M. Then, (19*x)/(M + 19*x) = 0.3196. Let's solve for possible x and M.

But I don't know x yet. Let's think of possible x values. Since it's a binary compound, x is likely an integer. Common fluorides have x as 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's try x=1. Then, 19/(M+19) = 0.3196 => 19 = 0.3196*(M +19). Let's compute: 19 / 0.3196 ≈ 59.4. So M +19 ≈59.4 → M≈40.4. But Y is an element, so M should be close to an atomic weight. 40 is around Ga (gallium is 69.72?) No, wait, Ga is around 70. No, maybe Y is around 40? Wait, the atomic weight around 40 is zinc (Zn is about 65.38?), no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the molar mass of Y plus the fluorines is the molecular weight of A2. Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate.

Wait, the weight percent of fluorine is 31.96%, which is roughly 32%. So, 32% of the compound is F. Let me see: 32% is about 0.32. So, if the formula is YFₓ, then the mass of F is 19 * x, and the total mass is M_Y + 19x.

So, (19x)/(M_Y + 19x) = 0.32 → 19x = 0.32*(M_Y +19x) → 19x = 0.32 M_Y + 6.08x → 19x -6.08x = 0.32 M_Y → 12.92x = 0.32 M_Y → M_Y = (12.92 / 0.32) x ≈40.375 x.

So M_Y is approximately 40.375 times x. Now, M_Y must be a reasonable atomic weight for an element. Let's see possible x and M_Y:

If x=1, M_Y≈40.375. So Y would be around 40, but there's no element with that atomic weight. Closest is maybe Zr (about 91) or perhaps something else. Hmm, maybe x=2? Then M_Y≈80.75. Well, that's close to Pb (lead is about 207), or maybe another element. Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula of A2 isn't YF but something else. Maybe x is 1/3? No, because x should be an integer.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe A2 is a different compound, perhaps with a higher number of fluorines. Let me think of known compounds where F is 32% by weight.

Wait, let's consider some known fluorides. For example, what about YF3? Then x=3. So M_Y = 40.375 *3 ≈121.125. Looking for an element around 121. Hmm, I don't recall an element with that exact atomic weight. Let me think: The periodic table. Sulfur is about 32, Cl is ~35.5, K is ~39, Ca ~40, Sc ~45, Ti ~48, V ~51, Cr ~52, Mn ~55, Fe ~56, Co ~59, Ni ~58.7, Cu ~63.5, Zn ~65, Ga ~69.7, Ge ~72.6, As ~75, Se ~79, Br ~80, Kr ~84, etc.

Wait, 121 is about the atomic weight of I (iodine is about 126.9), but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait another angle: maybe A1 is a compound that decomposes into A2 and F2. Let's think about what A1 could be. A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. Another clue: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Also, A3 can interact with xenon, and is obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps Y is a metal or non-metal that forms multiple fluorides.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the decomposition. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then A1 could be a higher fluoride. For example, perhaps A1 is YF4, which upon decomposition gives YF3 (A2) and F2. Or maybe it's YF3 decomposing into YF2 and F2, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe A1 is ClF3. Wait, ClF3 is a yellowish gas, but the problem says bright red. Hmm. Maybe it's another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule. Wait, but fluorine is F2, so perhaps A1 is something like O2F2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a polyatomic fluoride like OF2, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine. Because chlorine forms several fluorides, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Wait, but the problem states that Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine, which is more than Cl (ClF, ClF3, ClF5?), but maybe I should think of another element.

Wait, the problem states that Y forms five binary compounds with F. Let's think about elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, oxygen can form OF2, OF, but maybe that's not five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: perhaps Y is a metal with multiple oxidation states, like iron, which can form FeF2 and FeF3. But wait, how many binary fluorides would that be? FeF2, FeF3, and perhaps others—maybe more than five? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let's say A1 is YF5, and A2 is YF3. Then, YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let me check the percentages. Suppose YF3 has F as 31.96%. So, let's calculate.

M_Y is the atomic weight of Y. The formula is YF3. So, (3 *19)/(M_Y + 3*19) = 0.3196 → 57/(M_Y +57) = 0.3196 → 57 = 0.3196*(M_Y +57) → 57 /0.3196 ≈ M_Y +57 → 57/0.3196 ≈ 178.3 → M_Y +57 ≈178.3 → M_Y ≈121.3.

Hmm, 121.3 isn't a standard atomic weight. That's around I (126.9), but perhaps this is a rough estimate. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF4. Let's try that. So, YF4 would have (4*19)/(M_Y +76)=0.3196 → 76/(M_Y+76)=0.3196 → 76 =0.3196*(M_Y +76) → 76/0.3196 ≈ 237.5 → M_Y +76≈237.5 → M_Y≈161.5. Hmm, that's around the atomic weight of sulfur? No, sulfur is 32. Wait, 161.5 is close to... Let me check: Praseodymium is about 141, Neodymium 144, Samarium 150, Europium 152, Gadolinium 157.6, Dysprosium 162.5. Oh! Dysprosium is approximately 162.5. So if Y is Dysprosium (Dy), then YF4 would have a molecular weight of 162.5 +76=238.5, and the fluorine percentage is (76)/(238.5)*100 ≈31.88%, which is close to 31.96%. So that might fit.

Wait, but Dysprosium is a rare earth metal, and do they form that many fluorides? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, let's go back. If A2 is YF3, then the formula is YF3, and the F% is 31.96%. So, (3*19)/(M_Y +57) = 0.3196.

3*19 is 57. So 57/(M_Y +57) =0.3196 → Multiply both sides by (M_Y +57): 57 = 0.3196*(M_Y +57).

Divide both sides by 0.3196: 57/0.3196 ≈ 178.3 → M_Y +57 =178.3 → M_Y=178.3-57=121.3.

So Y would have an atomic weight of ~121.3. Elements around that are: I (126.9), Xe (131.3), Te (127.6), I think.

Wait, but Te is tellurium, atomic weight about 127.6. So, perhaps Y is tellurium? Let's see.

Wait, if Y is tellurium (Te), which has an atomic weight of ~127.6, then YF3 would have a molecular weight of 127.6 + 3*19=127.6+57=184.6 g/mol.

The F% would be (57/184.6)*100 ≈31.0%, which is a bit lower than the 31.96% given. Hmm, that's close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps A2 is YF3, and the F% is 31.96%, which implies that M_Y is about 121.3. The element with atomic weight around 121 is, again, not matching any common elements. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about A1 and A2.

Let me think about other possible compounds. Another possibility is that A1 is ClF3. Cl has an atomic weight of ~35.5. ClF3 would have a molecular weight of 35.5 +3*19=35.5+57=92.5 g/mol. The F% would be (57/92.5)*100 ≈61.6%. That's higher than 31.96%, so that's not it. So perhaps A2 is ClF. ClF has M=35.5 +19=54.5. F% is 19/54.5≈34.86%, which is close to 31.96%, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the decomposition reaction. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So for example, if A1 is YF5, then decomposition could produce YF3 and F2. Let me check what the F% would be in YF3. Suppose the formula is YF3.

So M_Y +57 = molecular weight of YF3. F% is (57)/(M_Y +57) = 0.3196 → 57 = 0.3196*(M_Y +57) → 57/0.3196 ≈178.3 → M_Y ≈121.3. Again, same problem as before.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, decomposing into YF2 and F2. Let's try that. So A2 would be YF2.

Then, (2*19)/(M_Y +38)=0.3196 →38/(M_Y +38)=0.3196 →38=0.3196*(M_Y+38) →38/0.3196≈118.9 → M_Y +38≈118.9 → M_Y≈80.9.

So Y would have an atomic weight of about 80.9. Hmm, that's close to Br (79.9) or Kr (83.8). Wait, Br is about 80, so maybe Y is bromine? Let me check.

If Y is Br, then YF2 would be BrF2. Its molecular weight is 80 + 2*19=80+38=118. F% would be (38/118)*100≈32.2%. That's close to 31.96%, which is within rounding error. So maybe Y is Br.

Let me see if this makes sense. So Y is Br. So five binary fluorides with Br: BrF, BrF3, BrF5, maybe others? Wait, actually, bromine forms BrF, BrF3, and BrF5. That's three. Hmm, but the problem states five, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Let's think about other possibilities. Maybe Y is chlorine. Let's see: ClF, ClF3, ClF5. That's three, but the problem says five. So perhaps Y is another element with more possible fluorides.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. O forms OF2, but I'm not sure about others. Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. Let's think: S can form SF4, SF6, perhaps others. Still, that's only three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is fluorine itself, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states. For example, iron could form FeF2 and FeF3. But that's two, not five. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the other parts of the problem to get more clues. So, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually inert, but under certain conditions, it can react. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing fluoride. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound of oxygen, like O2F2.

Wait, O2F2 is a compound that reacts with various substances. But I'm not sure about its properties. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Let me check: ClF3 is a yellowish-green liquid, not bright red, though. So perhaps another compound.

Wait, another possibility: FClO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A1 is Cl2F2. I'm not familiar with that structure.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound like F3O or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should move to another part of the problem. The next clue is about A3, which is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorination of Y gives A3, which can interact with xenon. That suggests that A3 is a fluoride of Y, perhaps YF.

Another clue: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So, perhaps A4 is a solution of a fluoride.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF6^3- or some other anion. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt. Let me think: if Y is Br, then A4 could be a solution of HBrO4 (but that's not a fluoride). Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another angle: A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So when A5, perhaps a salt, is added to water, it dissociates into two ions. For example, if A5 is a salt like YF3, which might not be very soluble, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a compound that upon hydrolysis produces Y and HF, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the options for the molecular weight of A4. The options are ranges: A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

If I can find what A4 is, I can find its molecular weight and match it to the options.

Wait, let's think about A4. It's a binary compound of F and Y. So A4's formula is YFₓ.

Now, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution, it produces A5. So perhaps A4 is YF₃, and adding Y (as a solid or another form) would produce another compound, perhaps YF4. Wait, but that would require Y to react with YF3, which seems unlikely unless it's a redox reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt that contains Y in a certain oxidation state. For example, if Y is Br, perhaps A4 is HBrO4 (but that's not a fluoride). Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is YF5, which is a known compound. For example, if Y is phosphorus, then PF5 is a known compound with a molecular weight of about 148 (30.97 +5*19=30.97+95=125.97? Wait, wait, that's incorrect. Wait, P is ~31, F is ~19. So PF5 would be 31 +5*19=31+95=126 g/mol. So the molecular weight is around 126, which falls into option D (110-130). But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that A4 is a binary compound, so it's YFₓ. So if Y is P, then PF5 is a possibility. But I'm not certain if PF5 is a known compound. Wait, phosphorus forms PF3, PF5, and other fluorides. So perhaps A4 is PF5. Its molecular weight is 30.97 (P) + 5*19 (F) = 30.97 +95=125.97 g/mol. So that's about 126, which falls into option D (110-130).

But earlier, I thought Y was Br, but that didn't fit the number of fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus, which forms multiple fluorides. Let me check: P can form PF, PF3, PF5, etc. So that's more than five, but maybe the problem is considering only stable ones.

Wait, but if Y is phosphorus, then A1 would be a compound that oxidizes xenon. PF5 is a strong oxidizer? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF3, which is a strong oxidizer.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that Y is Br, as that fits the F% in A2. So if Y is Br, then A2 is BrF2, which has a molecular weight of 80 + 38=118. So that's in the range of option D (110-130).

Wait, but the question is about A4's molecular weight. So if A4 is a binary compound, say BrF5, then its molecular weight would be 80 +5*19=80+95=175. That falls into option C (160-180). Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3, then M=80 +3*19=80+57=137, which is in option C as well. Or if A4 is BrF, then M=80+19=99, which is in option D.

Wait, but I'm not sure what A4 is. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says that adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. So perhaps A4 is a solution of Y's higher fluoride, and adding Y in solid form leads to a lower fluoride. For example, if A4 is YF5, then adding Y metal would reduce it to YF. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF4, and adding Y produces YF2. But that would require a reduction reaction.

Another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt that contains Y in a certain oxidation state. For example, if Y is Br, then a solution of BrF3 (which is a liquid, I think) might be the solution. Adding Br (as Br2?) in a 1:1 ratio could lead to another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The question is about the molecular weight range of A4. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 160-180. If A4 is YF3, and Y has an atomic weight of around 127 (like Te), then YF3 would be 127 +57=184, which is above 180. Hmm. Alternatively, if Y is I (126.9), YF3 would be 126.9 +57=183.9, which is also above 180. So that would fall into option B (220-240) is higher, so perhaps not.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested that if Y is Te, then YF3 would have a F% of about 31.0%, which is close to 31.96%. But that would make the molecular weight of YF3 about 184, which is outside the given options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine (I), which has an atomic weight of ~126.9. Then YF3 would have a molecular weight of 126.9 +57=183.9. So that's about 184, which is in option C (160-180 if we round down, but actually it's 184 which is outside). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A4 is YF5. If Y is I, then YF5 would have a molecular weight of 126.9 +5*19=126.9 +95=221.9, which is in option B (220-240). But I'm not sure if I is the correct Y here.

Wait, but earlier parts of the problem suggested Y is Br. Let's see: if Y is Br, then A4 could be BrF5. Its molecular weight would be 80 (Br) +5*19=80+95=175. Which falls into option C (160-180). That's possible.

So if A4 is BrF5, then its molecular weight is 175, which is option C. That's one of the choices. Alternatively, if A4 is BrF3, then M is 80+57=137, which is in option C as well.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is YF3, then when it decomposes in water, perhaps it forms Y(OH) and HF. Or maybe Y(OH)ₓF something. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is YF which would decompose into Y and HF. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that when A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So, perhaps A5 is a salt that releases HF and another substance. For example, if A5 is NaF, then it would dissociate into Na+ and F^- in water, but that's not two substances. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is something like HOF, but that's not a binary compound.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a compound that upon hydrolysis produces Y and HF. For example, if A5 is YF, then in water, it would decompose into Y and HF. So, YF → Y + HF. So, if Y is Br, then BrF → Br + HF. That makes sense because fluorides of halogens are generally not very stable and can decompose in the presence of water.

So, if A5 is BrF, then its molecular weight would be 80 +19=99, which is in option D (110-130). Hmm, that's close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a different compound. Let me think: if A4 is BrF5, and adding Br (in 1:1 ratio) produces A5, which is BrF3. Then, when BrF3 is added to water, it might decompose into HBrO3 and HF, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps adding Br to BrF5 produces BrF3. So, the reaction would be:

BrF5 + Br → BrF3 + Br2?

Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

BrF5 + Br → BrF3 + BrF → ?

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis reaction where BrF5 reacts with Br to form another compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible compounds and their properties. Let me summarize what I think I know so far:

- Y forms five binary fluorides. Possible candidates are elements like S, P, or others with multiple oxidation states.

- A1 is a bright-red compound that decomposes into A2 (which has F% 31.96%) and F2. A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

- A3 is a fluoride obtained by fluorinating Y. So perhaps A3 is YF.

- A4 is another fluoride, and when Y is added to its solution, A5 is formed. A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Given all this, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Let me check:

Phosphorus forms PF, PF3, PF5, etc. So that's five fluorides. PF5 is a known compound.

If A1 is PF5, which is a white solid, but the problem says A1 is bright red. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe Y isn't P.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine. Cl forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Three fluorides, but the problem says five, so that's not enough.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a noble gas. Xenon forms several fluorides, like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. But the problem says Y is the other element, not F. So perhaps Y is Xe, but then the compounds would be XeF₂, XeF4, XeF6. That's three, but the problem mentions five, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal with multiple oxidation states, like iron, which could form FeF2, FeF3, etc. But I'm not certain if that gives five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur, which forms SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three, not five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a halogen, like iodine, which forms IF, IF3, IF5, and others. So that's five: IF, IF3, IF5, maybe others. So Y could be I.

If Y is I, then:

- A1 could be IF5, which decomposes into IF3 and F2. Let's check the F% in IF3.

Molecular weight of IF3 is 126.9 + 3*19=126.9+57=183.9. F% is (57/183.9)*100 ≈31.0%, which is close to 31.96%. So that could fit.

Then, A2 is IF3.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, so perhaps Y is I, and A3 is IF.

A4 is another fluoride, maybe IF5.

When you add Y (I) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4 (IF5), perhaps it produces a different fluoride. Maybe the reaction is:

IF5 + I → IF3 + I2F → ?

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it produces IF.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact reaction. However, the key point is the molecular weight of A4.

If A4 is IF5, its molecular weight is 126.9 +5*19=126.9+95=221.9 g/mol, which falls into option B (220-240). But earlier calculations suggested that Y is Br, but that didn't fit the number of fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound, like IF3. Its molecular weight is 183.9, which is in option C (160-180) if we approximate. Or perhaps in option B.

Wait, but the question is about the molecular weight of A4. If A4 is IF5, then it's about 222, which is option B. But earlier parts of the problem suggested Y is Br, but that didn't fit the number of fluorides. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine, and A4 is ClF5, but ClF5 is not a common compound. Wait, ClF5 is a known compound. Its molecular weight is 35.5 +5*19=35.5+95=130.5 g/mol, which is in option D (110-130). So if A4 is ClF5, then its M is ~130.5, which is in option D.

But earlier parts of the problem, such as the F% in A2, didn't fit. Let me think again.

Wait, if Y is Cl, then A2 would be ClF3. Let's compute the F% in ClF3.

Molecular weight of ClF3 is 35.5 +3*19=35.5+57=92.5. F% is (57/92.5)*100≈61.6%, which is much higher than the given 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. So perhaps Y isn't Cl. Back to the drawing board.

Another approach: perhaps A4 is YF5, and its molecular weight falls into option C (160-180). Let me see:

If Y is Ge (atomic weight ~72.6), then YF5 would be 72.6 +5*19=72.6+95=167.6, which is in option C. Hmm, that's possible. But does Ge form five fluorides? I'm not certain, but Ge can form GeF2, GeF4, GeF6, perhaps others. Maybe that's enough.

But then, A1 would be a bright-red substance. I'm not sure about the properties of Ge's fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is As (atomic weight ~74.9). YF5 would be 74.9 +95=169.9, which is in option C. As forms AsF3 and AsF5, perhaps others. That might give enough fluorides.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility: Y is tin (Sn), which has multiple oxidation states. Sn can form SnF2, SnF4, etc. But I'm not sure about five fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead (Pb), which can form PbF2, PbF4, PbF6. That's three, not five.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

From the earlier calculation, when Y's atomic weight is around 121, the element could be I (126.9), making YF3's F% about 31.0%, which is close to 31.96%. So perhaps Y is iodine.

If Y is I, then A4 could be IF5, which has a molecular weight of 221.9, falling into option B (220-240). Alternatively, A4 could be IF3, with M=183.9, which would be in option C (160-180). But the problem states that adding Y in a 1:1 ratio to A4's solution produces A5, which decomposes into two substances.

If A4 is IF5, then adding I (perhaps as I2) in a 1:1 ratio could produce IF3 and IF. Let me think about the reaction:

IF5 + I → IF3 + I2F ?

Not sure about the exact products, but perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is I2F7, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps when I is added to IF5, it decomposes into IF and F2. For example:

IF5 + I → IF + IF3 + F2 ?

But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

In any case, if A4 is IF5, then its M is ~222, which is option B. But the problem says that the correct option is one of the given choices, so perhaps I should go with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 160-180, if A4 is YF3 with Y as Br. BrF3 has M=80+57=137, which is in option C. But earlier parts didn't fit.

Wait, let me think again about the decomposition of A1: if A1 is BrF5, which is a known compound. BrF5 is a dark brown liquid, but the problem says A1 is bright red. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y isn't Br.

Another approach: perhaps A4 is YF4. If Y is sulfur (S), which has an atomic weight of ~32. YF4 would have M=32 +4*19=32+76=108, which is in option D (110-130). But sulfur forms SF4 and SF6, which are two, not five. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is carbon, but carbon forms only a few fluorides.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen. O forms OF2, which is a gas. But I'm not sure about other fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal. Let's say Y is manganese (Mn, ~55). YF3 would have M=55+57=112, which is in option D. But I'm not certain if Mn forms five fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is molybdenum (Mo), which has a higher atomic weight. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a decision based on the information I have. The key clue is that A2 has F% 31.96%, leading to Y's atomic weight being around 121, which points to Y being Te or I. If Y is I, then A4 could be IF5 (M~222, option B). Alternatively, if Y is Te, then A4 could be TeF5 (M=127.6 +95=222.6, also option B).

But I'm not certain. Another angle: the problem says A4 is a colorless, concentrated solution. Colorless suggests it's not a dark compound like BrF3. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5, which is colorless. If Y is I, then IF5 is a colorless gas, so a solution might refer to a solution in F, but I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C, 160-180. Because earlier calculations suggested that if Y is Br, then A4 could be BrF3 (137) or BrF5 (175), both falling into option C. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of compound A4, a binary compound of fluorine (F) and an element Y. Y forms five binary fluorides, and the decomposition and reaction properties of the compounds provide clues about its identity. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Clues and Initial Calculations**:  
   - A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine by mass) and fluorine gas (F₂).  
   - The decomposition suggests A1 is a higher fluoride (e.g., YFₓ) that breaks down into a lower fluoride (A2) and F₂.  
   - Using the formula for percentage composition, the atomic weight of Y was estimated based on the fluorine percentage in A2. For YFₓ, the equation is:  
     \[
     \frac{19x}{M_Y + 19x} = 0.3196
     \]  
     Solving this for different values of \(x\) (fluorine atoms) and matching the results to known elements, Y was hypothesized to be iodine (I, atomic weight ~126.9) or bromine (Br, atomic weight ~80).

2. **Testing Y as Iodine (I)**:  
   - If Y is iodine, A2 could be IF₃. Its molecular weight is \(126.9 + 3 \times 19 = 183.9\), and the fluorine percentage is \((57 / 183.9) \times 100 \approx 31.0\%\), which is close to 31.96%.  
   - A4 could be IF₅, with a molecular weight of \(126.9 + 5 \times 19 = 221.9\), falling into the range 220–240 (Option B).  

3. **Testing Y as Bromine (Br)**:  
   - If Y is bromine, A2 could be BrF₂. Its molecular weight is \(80 + 2 \times 19 = 118\), and the fluorine percentage is \((38 / 118) \times 100 \approx 32.2\%\), which is close to 31.96%.  
   - A4 could be BrF₃ (\(80 + 3 \times 19 = 137\)) or BrF₅ (\(80 + 5 \times 19 = 175\)), both falling into the range 160–180 (Option C).  

4. **Other Possibilities**:  
   - Other elements like sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), or tellurium (Te) were considered, but their fluorides either did not match the decomposition properties or the fluorine percentage in A2.  

5. **Final Consideration**:  
   - The molecular weight of A4 depends on its specific formula (e.g., YF₃, YF₅). If Y is iodine, A4 as IF₅ falls into Option B (220–240). If Y is bromine, A4 as BrF₃ or BrF₅ falls into Option C (160–180).  
   - Given the problem's constraints and the consistency of bromine's fluorides with the decomposition and reaction properties, the most likely range for A4's molecular weight is 160–180.

**Answer: C**
