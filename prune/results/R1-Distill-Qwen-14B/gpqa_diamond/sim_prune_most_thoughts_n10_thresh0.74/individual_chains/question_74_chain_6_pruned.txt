Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, 150 minutes from when? Oh, right, the 50 minutes have already passed, so I think the next 150 minutes would be from the current time, which is 50 minutes in. But wait, 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. But the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the half-life or something else.

Wait, no, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The decay constant is a key factor here. The probability of decay over a certain time is given by 1 minus the exponential of negative lambda times time. So the formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that, the initial information is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for lambda.

Rearranging that, e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100. Let me calculate that. 

What's ln(0.68)? Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is about -0.385. So λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute. 

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So the total time elapsed would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm only interested in the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless. That means the probability of decaying after time t given that it hasn't decayed before is the same as the probability of decaying in time t from the start. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. Or does it?

Wait, no. Because the decay probability is dependent on the time passed. So the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed up to 50 minutes.

Hmm, so
