Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as ħ/2 multiplied by specific 2x2 matrices.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. The eigenvalue would be the result of the measurement.

So, the operator in question is P, which is a vector operator. Since the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, the operator P must be expressed in terms of the components along n. Or wait, maybe I need to consider the operator along direction n, which would be a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh, wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary, perhaps the actual operator is the component of P along n, which is P·n. Because for any direction, the observable is the component along that direction.

Wait, the question says the operator is P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is actually P·n. Because if you have a vector operator P (like angular momentum), the component along a direction n is given by P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

So, first I need to find the matrix representation of the operator P·n. Then, find its eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is P along direction n. So the operator is P·n, which is a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the matrix will be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z).

Wait, but what's given in the problem are P_x, P_y, P_z. Let me note down their matrices.

Given:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, direction n is in the x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n_y = 0.

Wait, because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

So the operator along n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Because n_y is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

So the matrix for P·n is:

P·n = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me write that out.

The matrix would be:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because:

First term (from P_x): [[0, n_x * (ħ/2)], [n_x * (ħ/2), 0]]
Second term (from P_z): [[n_z * (ħ/2), 0], [0, -n_z * (ħ/2)]]

Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

Row 1: [n_z (ħ/2), (n_x)(ħ/2)]
Row 2: [n_x (ħ/2), -n_z (ħ/2)]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, no, because each element is multiplied by ħ/2. So the matrix is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. Hmm, that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So M = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We can write the eigenvalue equation as M |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = (ħ/2) [a, b]^T.

Since ħ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by (ħ/2), yielding:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T.

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z a + n_x b = a

n_x a - n_z b = b

So we have two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2. n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, let's write them more clearly.

Equation 1: n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0

Equation 2: n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So we have a homogeneous system of equations. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

The coefficient matrix is:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x       ]
[ n_x       (-n_z -1) ]

The determinant D is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2.

Expanding D:

= ( -n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1 ) - n_x^2

Wait, (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) = -(n_z^2 -1) = -n_z^2 +1.

So D = (-n_z^2 +1) - (n_x)^2.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So n_x^2 = 1 -n_z^2.

Substituting, D= (-n_z^2 +1) - (1 -n_z^2) )= (-n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2) )= 0.

So the determinant is zero, so the system has non-trivial solutions. So the equations are consistent.

Now, let's look at the equations.

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b.

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] * b.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me see if I can find a relationship between a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a ratio between a and b. Let me take the two equations.

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b =0 → a = -(n_x b)/(n_z -1)

Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0 → a = [ (n_z +1) b ] / (n_x )

Wait, but I have a from both equations. So setting them equal:

-(n_x b)/(n_z -1) = [ (n_z +1) b ] / n_x

Assuming b ≠0, I can cancel b:

- n_x / (n_z -1) =
