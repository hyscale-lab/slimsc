Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, the researcher checked the reaction using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction is proceeding, and two new spots appeared, which are the products.

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me draw that out. Oxybenzene means it's a benzene ring with an ether group (-O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, let's break that down.

But-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So, numbering from the end attached to oxygen, it's CH2-CH=CH-CH2? Wait no, but the substituents matter. Wait, but the structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait no, but that would be but-1-en-3-yl or something. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl would be the group where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait but has four carbons. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4, meaning the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? Wait no, that can't be right. Let me write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's without a double bond. Oh wait, but in but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, but that would mean the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That doesn't make sense because but has four carbons in a row. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait but that's but-1-en-4-yl or but-3-en-1-yl?

Ah, I think the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The but-3-en-1-yl group is: starting from the point of attachment (position 1), the next is position 2, then 3, which is double bonded to 4. So it's:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at C3, but in a four-carbon chain, the possible double bonds are between C1-C2 (but-1-ene) and C2-C3 (but-2-ene). So, but-3-en-1-yl doesn't exist because the double bond would be beyond the fourth carbon. Oh
