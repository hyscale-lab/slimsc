Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what product 4 looks like. The question involves a series of reactions starting from a specific compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH attached. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CH2 group but with a double bond. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH3)-, so it's an isopropenyl group, right? So the 5 position has an isopropenyl substituent.

So the first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating things. Benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent, often used in alkylation. But wait, where would the deprotonation happen?

Looking at the starting molecule, there's a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The OH is acidic because it's adjacent to a ketone (cyclohexanone). So, the OH can be deprotonated by sodium hydride to form an alkoxide. Then, benzyl bromide would react with that alkoxide, substituting the bromide and adding a benzyl group.

So, the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) would become CH2O- after deprotonation. Then, benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) would attack, giving CH2O(C6H5CH2-) as the product. Wait, no, more accurately, the oxygen would have the benzyl group attached. So the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether. So the structure after product 1 would have a benzyl group attached to the oxygen at position 3, making it OCH2Ph (Ph is benzene).

So product 1 is 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Wait, maybe more accurately, the structure is now 3-((benzyl)oxy)methyl cyclohexanone with substituents. So the OH at 3 becomes OCH2Ph.

Next step is treating product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2. Hmm. p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which is usually for removing ketones by converting them into amines. Wait, the Wolff-Kishner reaction involves treating a carbonyl group with hydrazine, then with a strong base like NaOH and heat to eliminate the carbonyl, forming a hydrocarbon.

But wait, in this case, the reagent is p-toluenesulfony
