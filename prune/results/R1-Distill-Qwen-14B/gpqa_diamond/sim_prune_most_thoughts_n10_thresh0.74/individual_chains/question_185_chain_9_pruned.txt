Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian is an operator that often represents the energy of a system. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian give the possible energy levels of that system.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices, right, σ has components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's in some direction, but arbitrary. Oh, right, the dot product would then be σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Wait, but how does this operator look? Since it's a 2x2 matrix, because Pauli matrices are 2x2. So the Hamiltonian H would be a 2x2 matrix as well. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the trace and determinant, or perhaps knowing the form of the Pauli matrices.

I remember that for any Pauli matrix, say σ_i, multiplied by a scalar a, the eigenvalues are ±a. But wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, right? So if we have something like σ · n, which is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, but n is a unit vector so that the sum would be similar to just a single Pauli matrix in a specific direction.

Wait, what's the general case. If I have a vector n = (n_x
