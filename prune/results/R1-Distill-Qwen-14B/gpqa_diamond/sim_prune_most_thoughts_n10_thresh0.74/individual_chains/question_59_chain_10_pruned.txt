Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The problem is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, first, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are present and see if one is in excess.

Wait, but the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base in the solutions. Because moles will determine the reaction.

Let me start with each solution.

1. Acetic acid: CH3COOH is a weak acid. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl: That's a strong acid. Volume is 400 mL (0.4 L), molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2: That's a strong base. The volume is 300 mL (0.3 L), molarity 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- ions per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each gives 2 OH-, the total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the next step is to figure out how the acid and base react. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely as well. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but in the presence of a strong base, I'm guessing the OH- will react with the H+ from the strong acids first.

Wait, but the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ readily, so the OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl first, then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from acetic acid.

But wait, wait. Let's think in terms of H+ and OH-.

First, calculate the total H+ from strong acids, then the OH- from the strong base.

HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+. Acetic acid gives 0.05 moles of H+ (but since it's weak, not sure if it's all available, but when mixed with base, the strong base's OH- might take all that H+).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps calculate the net H+ or OH- after all reactions.

Wait, let me think: when you mix acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So first, sum up all the H+ from all the acids. Then sum up all OH- from all bases. Then subtract to see what's left.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all its H+. Acetic acid is a weak acid; it will donate some H+ but not all, but in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the base will take the H+ from both.

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Because the OH
