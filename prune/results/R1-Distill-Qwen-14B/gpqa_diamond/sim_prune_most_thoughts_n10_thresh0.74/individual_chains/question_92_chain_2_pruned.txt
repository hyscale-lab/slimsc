Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. The formula I remember is that you calculate the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, for enthalpy of formation, it's the reverse. The standard enthalpy of formation is calculated using the energies of the bonds in the reactants and products. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think.

The formula I believe is: ΔH°f = [ (number of bonds) × bond energy for reactants ] - [ (number of bonds) × bond energy for products ]. Or maybe it's the sum of the bond energies of the products minus the sum of the reactants. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies. The standard approach is to assume that the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms. So, for example, each C is in its standard state, which would be graphite, but here they gave the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a mole of bonds in gaseous element into atoms.

Wait, so the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. That means each C atom in the molecule contributes 1000 kJ when formed from graphite? Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the atomization approach. So, the formula is:

ΔH_f° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule) - (sum of bond energies of the elements in their standard states).

Wait, no. Let me try to recall. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants to form atoms, then the energy released when the bonds form in the products. So, the formula is something like:

ΔH = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, but in the case of enthalpy of formation, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the products are the target
