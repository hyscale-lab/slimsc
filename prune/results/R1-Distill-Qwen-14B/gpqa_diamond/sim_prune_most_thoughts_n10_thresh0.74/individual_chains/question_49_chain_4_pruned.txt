Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A. Wait, what's that molecule look like? 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2, right? And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually not possible because but-3-en- would imply a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C3, which would be between C3 and C4. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have OH on C2, so structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait no, wait but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C2 and C3, but that would be but-2-en-2-ol. Hmm, maybe I should think of the structure as (CH2)2CH-OH with a double bond elsewhere? Wait, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait but the double
