Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let's try to work through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex molecule. I think I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for organic compounds, that usually means from carbon ( graphite maybe) and hydrogen gas.

The problem gives me some data: the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that's C-C bonds breaking, right? And the bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H are provided.

Wait, but the molecule given is an alkene, right? Because I see double bonds in the structure. Like, there are C=C groups in the structure. So I need to consider all the bonds in this molecule when calculating the formation enthalpy.

The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed)

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, wait. Let me think. The standard approach is to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and form all bonds in the product. So for the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the product is the compound.

So, for carbon, in its standard state, it's graphite, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So to break carbon into atoms, it's 1000 kJ per mole of C.

Hydrogen is in H2 gas as the standard state. So each H-H bond breaking gives 100 kJ/mol.

Now, the product is the compound given. So, the reaction would be something like:

a C(graphite) + b H2(g) → 1 mol of the compound.

I need to calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction using bond energies.

Wait, but bond energies are typically given per bond. So I should count all the bonds in the product and the reactants.

Wait, the reactants are C and H2. So for each mole of C, we have to break C-C bonds (if in a solid), but wait, the enthalpy of atomization is already given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So each mole of C needs 1000 kJ to become gaseous atoms. Then, those atoms form bonds in the product molecule.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the energies required to break all bonds in the elements minus the sum of the energies released when forming all bonds in the compound.

So, for the formation of the compound, the bonds in the reactants (elements) are broken, and the bonds in the product are formed. So the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds broken in reactants)] - [sum (bonds formed in product)]

But wait, the reactants are in their standard states, which are C (graphite) and H2 (gas). So breaking the bonds in C and H2 would contribute to the enthalpy.

Wait, but C(graphite) has C-C bonds. The enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol. So for each mole of C, breaking all the C-C bonds (assuming it's a diamond structure, but I think graphite is more appropriate). Hmm, but maybe the problem abstracts away the specific structure and just gives the atomization enthalpy as 1000 kJ/mol. So for each mole of C, we have to spend 1000 kJ to get gaseous C atoms.

Similarly, H2 has H-H bonds. Breaking each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol.

So for the reaction, the reactants are C (graphite) and H2(g), and the product is the given compound.

The reaction would be:

C (graphite) + H2(g) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

But to balance the equation, I need to find out how many moles of C and H2 are involved.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total bonds broken in the reactants and the total bonds formed in the product, then calculate ΔHf.

So, the total bonds broken in reactants:

Each C in graphite has bonds. The atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol per C. So for each mole of C, we break bonds to get gaseous C atoms. So for the compound, let's see how many C atoms it has.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Each part: (CH3)2C=CH-: that's 2 methyl groups attached to a C which is double-bonded to another CH. So let's count the C's.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms in the compound.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 4 C (2 methyl groups, one central C, and one CH). Wait, no. Wait, the (CH3)2C=CH- group is a propene group. So (CH3)2C=CH- would have 3 C in the (CH3)2C= part, plus the CH, so 4 C? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH- is like CH2-C(CH3)2=CH2? No, perhaps it's a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diene or a polyene. Regardless, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms in the entire molecule.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let's break it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH: this is a group with 3 C (the central C with two CH3, then a double bond to CH).

Wait, actually, (CH3)2C=CH- is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-

So the C in the middle is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH group. So that's 3 C in this part.

Then, the next part: -CH2- is just a CH2 group.

Then -CH(CH3)-: this is a CH group attached to a CH3, so that's 1 C.

Then another CH2-.

Then -CH=C(CH3)2: this is a CH group connected via double bond to a C(CH3)2 group.

So let's count the number of C in each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (the central C, plus the two CH3's, but wait, no, each CH3 is one C. So (CH3)2 is two C, the central C is third, and the CH is fourth. So this part is 4 C?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write out the entire structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a molecule with 10 carbons. Let me count.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So each (CH3)2 is two C, then C=CH is another two C, but wait, no:

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH- is a substituent with three C: the central C, the two CH3's (each C), and the CH (another C). Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-

So that's three C in that group: the central C (C1), each CH3 has a C (C2 and C3), and the CH is another C (C4). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: (CH3)2C=CH-: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH group. So that's 3 carbons (the central C, and each CH3 is a C), but wait, each CH3 is a methyl group, so it's (CH3)2-C=CH-.

So that group is four C in total: the central C, two from the CH3 groups, and the CH? No, perhaps that's three C in the substituent. Because (CH3)2-C=CH- is C-C=C, right? Because the central C is connected to two CH3 groups, and the double bond to another CH.

Wait, perhaps each (CH3) group is a C, so (CH3)2C=CH- would be 2 (from CH3) + 1 (the central C) + 1 (the CH in the double bond) = 4 C. Hmm, maybe.

But perhaps a better way is to parse the entire formula:

The entire molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : this is 4 C (3 from the (CH3)2C= part, and 1 from CH, but wait, (CH3)2C= is 3 C (two CH3 and the central C). Then CH- is another C, making it 4 C in this part.

2. CH2- : 1 C.

3. CH(CH3)- : 1 C (the CH) plus the CH3 (1 C) → total 2 C in this segment.

4. CH2- : 1 C.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH is 1 C, C= is 1 C, and (CH3)2 is 2 C → 4 C in this part.

Wait, but let me sum each:

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (the (CH3)2C= part has two CH3 and one C, and then CH-) adds one more C. So 3 +1 =4?

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let's think about each segment:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : The structure is (CH3)2-C=CH- which is four carbons: two CH3 groups, one central C, and the CH group from the double bond.

Wait, but the double bond is between the central C and the CH. So the (CH3)2C=CH- group has 4 C? No, because (CH3)2-C=CH- has the central C as 1, then two CH3 (each a C, so 2 more), and the CH (another C). So 1+2+1=4 C.

Next, the -CH2-: 1 C.

Then, -CH(CH3)-: that's 2 C (the CH and the CH3).

Next, -CH2-: 1 C.

Then, -CH=C(CH3)2: that's 4 C (the CH, the C in the double bond, and the two CH3 groups).

Wait, but wait: the CH=C(CH3)2 is a group where the C is double-bonded to CH, and has two CH3 groups attached. So that's 1 (CH) + 1 (C) + 2 (CH3) = 4 C.

Wait, but the entire molecule would have:

4 (from first group) + 1 (CH2) + 2 (CH(CH3)) + 1 (CH2) + 4 (CH=C(CH3)2) = 4+1+2+1+4= 12 C?

Wait, but let me count each carbon explicitly:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : 

   a. (CH3)2: two CH3 groups → 2 C.

   b. C= : that's the central C → 1 C.

   c. CH- : 1 C.

Total: 2+1+1 =4 C.

2. CH2- : 1 C.

3. CH(CH3)- : 

   a. CH: 1 C.

   b. CH3: 1 C.

Total: 2 C.

4. CH2- :1 C.

5. CH=C(CH3)2:

   a. CH: 1 C.

   b. C= : 1 C.

   c. (CH3)2: 2 C.

Total: 4 C.

So adding all together: 4 +1 +2 +1 +4 =12 C.

So the molecule has 12 C atoms.

Each C comes from the reactant C(graphite). So for each mole of the compound, we need 12 moles of C.

But wait, each mole of C in graphite is bonded into the compound. So to break all the C-C bonds in graphite to get gaseous C atoms, each C requires 1000 kJ/mol. So for 12 C atoms, that's 12 * 1000 kJ = 12,000 kJ.

Wait, but the reaction is 1 mole of the compound formed from 12 C and some H2. So for each mole of the compound, 12 moles of C are used. Hence, the bond energy for breaking C in graphite is 12 * 1000 kJ.

But wait, wait, I think the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C. So for each C atom in the product, you have to break the bonds in graphite to get a gaseous C atom, which is 1000 kJ per C.

So for 12 C atoms in the product, the total energy to break is 12 * 1000 kJ = 12,000 kJ.

Now, the H in the product comes from H2 gas. Each H2 molecule has a bond that must be broken. Each H2 has one H-H bond, which is 100 kJ/mol.

Each H in the product comes from H2. So how many H atoms are in the product?

Looking at the formula again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group has 3 H. Let's count all the H:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 

- (CH3)2 → 2 *3 =6 H.

- C=CH-: that CH has 1 H. So 6 +1 =7 H in this group.

Then, the next CH2- group: 2 H.

Then, the CH(CH3)- group:

- CH has 1 H.

- CH3 has 3 H. So 1+3=4 H.

Then, the CH2- group: 2 H.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 group: 

- CH has 1 H.

- C(CH3)2 → each CH3 has 3 H, so 2 *3 =6 H.

So 1 +6 =7 H in this group.

Adding all H:

7 (from first group) + 2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C group) = 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+7=22 H atoms.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I did that wrong. Let me recount:

Breaking down each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   (CH3)2 → 2 *3 =6 H.

   CH-: 1 H.

   So total 7 H.

2. -CH2- : 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-: 

   CH has 1 H.

   CH3 has 3 H.

   So 1 +3=4 H.

4. -CH2- : 2 H.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2: 

   CH has 1 H.

   C(CH3)2 → 2 *3 =6 H.

   So 1 +6=7 H.

Now, adding them all: 7 +2 +4 +2 +7 = 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+7=22 H atoms.

So the molecule has 22 H atoms. Each H comes from H2, so each H2 molecule provides 2 H atoms. Hence, the number of H2 molecules needed is 22 / 2 =11 H2 molecules.

Each H2 molecule requires 100 kJ/mol to break the H-H bond. So 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

So the total energy for breaking bonds in reactants is 12,000 (C) + 1100 (H) =13,100 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the product are all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Wait, wait, no. Because when you form the product, you're creating all new bonds. So the bonds formed are all the single bonds (C-C, C-H) and the double bonds (C=C). Each bond has its own bond energy.

So I need to count all the bonds in the product and sum their bond energies.

But how many of each type are present?

Let me think about the structure.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking for all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

First, let's count the number of single C-C bonds, C=C bonds, and C-H bonds.

The molecule structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the double bonds are between which carbons?

1. (CH3)2C=C-CH-CH2-... etc. So the first double bond is between the central C and the CH group.

2. The second double bond is in the CH=C(CH3)2 part. So another double bond.

So, the molecule has two C=C double bonds.

Now, the single bonds:

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds.

The other CH groups: each CH has one C-H bond.

So let's count all C-H bonds.

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 C-H.

Each CH group contributes 1 C-H.

Let me count all CH3 groups and CH groups.

Number of CH3 groups:

In (CH3)2C=CH- → 2 CH3.

In CH2 groups → each CH2 has two CH2 groups, which have two C-H each. Wait, no: each CH2 has two C-H single bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each C-H.

Wait, the molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's go through each carbon and count the number of C-H bonds.

1. The first (CH3)2C=CH- group:

   a. Each CH3 has 3 C-H → 2 *3=6.

   b. The central C is connected to two CH3 and a double bond. So no C-H here.

   c. The CH in the double bond has 1 C-H.

   So total for this group: 6 +1 =7 C-H.

2. The next CH2- group:

   CH2 has 2 C-H bonds.

   So 2.

3. Then CH(CH3)-:

   This CH has 1 C-H, and the CH3 has 3 C-H.

   So 1 +3 =4.

4. Next CH2-:

   2 C-H.

5. Then CH- group in CH=C(CH3)2:

   1 C-H.

6. The C=C is a double bond, so the adjacent C (in C(CH3)2) has two CH3 groups, each with 3 C-H.

   So 2 *3 =6.

Now adding all C-H bonds:

7 (group 1) + 2 (group2) +4 (group3) +2 (group4) +1 (group5) +6 (group6) = 7+2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +1=16, +6=22.

So 22 C-H bonds.

So each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. So total C-H bond energy is 22 *400 =8800 kJ.

Now, C-C single bonds:

We need to count all the single C-C bonds in the molecule.

Looking at the structure, let's see:

Each CH2- is a single bond. The CH-CH2- is a single bond.

Let me list all the single bonds:

1. Between the central C and each CH3 in (CH3)2C=CH-: two single bonds.

2. Between the CH in the double bond and the next CH2: single bond.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): single bond.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: single bond.

5. Between CH2 and CH=C(...): single bond.

6. Between the CH in CH=C and the C in C(CH3)2: double bond, so not counted as single.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: each single bond between C atoms.

Looking at the molecule's structure, each single bond is:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single C-C bonds are:

1. Between the central C and each CH3 → two.

2. Between the CH (from the double bond) and the CH2 → one.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3) → one.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2 → one.

5. Between CH2 and CH=C(... → one.

So that's 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 =6 single C-C bonds.

Each C-C single bond has a bond energy of 200 kJ/mol. So 6 *200 =1200 kJ.

Now, the double bonds: two of them.

Each C=C has a bond energy of 300 kJ/mol. So 2 *300 =600 kJ.

So the total bonds formed in the product are:

C-H: 22 *400 =8800 kJ.

C-C single:6 *200=1200 kJ.

C=C:2 *300=600 kJ.

Total bonds formed energy: 8800 +1200 +600 =10600 kJ.

Now, the bonds broken in the reactants were 13100 kJ.

So the enthalpy change (ΔHf) is bonds broken minus bonds formed.

ΔHf = 13100 - 10600 =2500 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no! Wait, no, no. Because when you form bonds, you release energy. So the formula is bonds broken (reactants) minus bonds formed (products) gives the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, let me think: the reaction is reactants → products.

The enthalpy of formation is the energy change from reactants to products.

The reactants are elements, which require breaking their bonds to get to atoms (endothermic), and then forming the product's bonds (exothermic).

So, the total enthalpy is the sum of bond energies broken in reactants minus the sum of bond energies formed in products.

Wait, but I'm getting 13100 kJ (reactants broken) minus 10600 kJ (products formed) → 2500 kJ.

But 2500 kJ is positive, meaning the reaction is endothermic.

Looking at the options, none of them are 2500. The options are A)11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, let me recount the H atoms.

In the molecule, each group contributes H:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 CH3 (6 H) + CH (1 H) →7 H.

2. -CH2- :2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-: CH has 1 H, CH3 has3 →4 H.

4. -CH2-:2 H.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, each CH3 has3 → 2*3=6 →7 H.

So 7+2+4+2+7 =22 H. That's correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C in the molecule.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: 3 C (the two CH3 and the central C) plus the CH gives 4 C? Or wait, (CH3)2 C=CH- is 3 C (two CH3 and central C), and the CH is another C, so 4 C in this part.

Then, the next CH2 is 1 C.

Then CH(CH3):1 C (the CH) and the CH3 is another C →2 C.

Then CH2 is 1 C.

Then CH=C(CH3)2: CH is 1 C, C is another, and two CH3 (2 C) →4 C.

So total C: 4 +1 +2 +1 +4=12 C. Correct.

Hmm, so the calculation of 13100-10600=2500 kJ remains, but no options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds formed.

Wait, let me recount the C-C single bonds.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the structure can be viewed as:

- (CH3)2-C double bond to CH-.

Then, CH- is single-bonded to CH2.

CH2 is single-bonded to CH(CH3).

CH(CH3) is single-bonded to CH2.

CH2 is single-bonded to CH which is double-bonded to C(CH3)2.

So the single C-C bonds are:

1. (CH3)2-C-CH: that's a single bond between C and CH.

Wait, no, no. The (CH3)2C=CH- part has a double bond between C and CH.

So the single bonds would be:

- Between the CH (from the double bond) and the CH2 → single.

- Between CH2 and CH(CH3) → single.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2 → single.

- Between CH2 and CH=C → single.

And the two CH3 groups are attached to the central C via single bonds.

Wait, so the number of single C-C bonds:

1. Each CH3 group is connected via single bond to central C → 2 bonds.

2. CH (from the double bond) to CH2 →1.

3. CH2 to CH(CH3) →1.

4. CH(CH3) to CH2 →1.

5. CH2 to CH=C →1.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1=6. So that's correct.

Hmm. Then, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C=C bonds.

Looking again, the molecule has two double bonds: between (CH3)2C and CH, and between CH and C in the last part.

So two C=C bonds.

Ok, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the reaction doesn't use H2, but perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated per mole, and perhaps the H is accounted for differently.

Wait, the reaction should be:

12 C (graphite) + 11 H2 → 1 mol of compound.

So the bonds broken in H2 are 11 H2 → each H2 has one bond broken. So 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

Bonds broken in C:12 *1000=12000.

Total broken:13100.

In the product, all bonds are formed.

But perhaps I forgot to account for the initial state in the product.

Wait, the problem says that the enthalpy of formation is calculated from the elements in their standard states. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the bond energies are given as per mole of bond, not per mole of reaction.

So for example, each C in C(graphite) has multiple C-C bonds. The enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol of C.

So each C atom in the product requires 1000 kJ to break away from the graphite.

So 12 C atoms →12,000 kJ.

Similarly, each H2 molecule has one bond → 100 kJ/mol.

But in the product, bonds are formed: C-C (200), C=C (300), C-H (400).

So, the calculation seems correct.

But the options don't have 2500.

Wait, perhaps the question is the enthalpy of formation of the molecule, but maybe it's in kJ per gram, not per mole. Oh, looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g and D is 1900 kJ/g.

Wait, but the given bond energies are in kJ/mol, so the calculated enthalpy of formation is per mole.

But the options are in kJ/g and kJ/mol.

Wait, maybe the units are wrong. Let's check the problem statement again.

The options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol.

B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

C) 11.44 kJ/g.

D) 1900 kJ/g.

So if the answer is 2500 kJ/mol, but that's not an option. So I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, let's recount the C and H.

Alternative approach: the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

This can be written as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the formula can be written as:

The molecule has 12 C and 22 H.

So the molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 12 C and 22 H, that's correct.

So the molecular formula is C12H22.

So the molar mass is 12*(12.01 g/mol) + 22*(1.008 g/mol).

Wait, but perhaps I don't need to calculate the molar mass unless the answer is in kJ/g.

But the options have some in kJ/g.

But the problem asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is typically in kJ/mol.

So if my calculation is 2500 kJ/mol and the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms × enthalpy of H atomization) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

But wait, the enthalpy of H atomization is not given. Oh, wait, the bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy of H atomization would be half of that, because each H-H bond breaks into two H atoms. So each H atom has an enthalpy of 50 kJ/mol.

Wait, perhaps that's the key mistake. I used 100 kJ/mol per H2, but perhaps I should account for each H atom's energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the bond energies as:

For the reactants:

Each C in graphite: 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous C atoms.

Each H2 molecule: 100 kJ/mol to break into 2 H atoms.

So for 12 C atoms: 12 *1000 =12,000 kJ.

For 22 H atoms: since each H2 provides 2 H, 22 H requires 11 H2 molecules. Each H2 is 100 kJ →11*100=1100 kJ.

So total reactant bonds broken:12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ.

In the product, the molecule has:

Number of C-C bonds:6 →6 *200=1200.

Number of C=C bonds:2 →2 *300=600.

Number of C-H bonds:22 →22 *400=8800.

Total bonds formed:1200+600+8800=10600 kJ.

So ΔHf=13,100 -10,600 =2500 kJ.

Hmm, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule, but perhaps the calculation is per mole of the molecule, but if the molecule has a higher molar mass, the per gram value would be lower.

Wait, the molecular formula is C12H22.

Molar mass= (12 *12.01) + (22 *1.008) = 144.12 +22.176=166.296 g/mol.

So the enthalpy of formation in kJ/g would be 2500 kJ/mol / 166.296 g/mol ≈ 15.01 kJ/g.

But none of the options is close to that. Option C is 11.44, which is lower.

Hmm, maybe I missed something else.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the molecule has double bonds, which might have more than one bond? No, because each C=C is considered as a single bond with energy 300 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C single bonds.

In the molecule, the single C-C bonds are:

- Each CH3 attached to the central C →2 bonds.

- CH (from the double bond) to CH2 →1.

- CH2 to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) to CH2 →1.

- CH2 to CH=C →1.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1=6. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts each double bond as two bonds? No, because bond energy is given per bond. So a double bond counts as one bond with higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C-C bond somewhere.

Looking again:

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the backbone is:

C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

Each - is a single bond.

So the single bonds are:

Between each of the following:

1. (CH3)2C and CH (double bond, so no single bond here).

Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the single bonds are:

- CH (from double bond) to CH2 →1.

- CH2 to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) to CH2 →1.

- CH2 to CH (in CH=C) →1.

Then, the two CH3 groups attached to the central C →2.

So 6 in total.

Wait, another approach: the molecule can be viewed as having seven single bonds.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, maybe each CH3 group is connected via a single bond. So for (CH3)2C=CH-...:

The central C has two CH3 groups attached via single bonds. Then, it's double bonded to CH.

So two single C-C bonds from central C.

Then, the CH (from double bond) is connected via single bond to CH2 →1.

CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

CH2 connected to CH=C →1.

So that's 2+1+1+1+1=6.

Hmm, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscounted the C=C bonds. Are there more than two?

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Yes, two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bonds broken in the reactants.

Wait, perhaps the H is being counted as atoms, but the bond energies are per mole of bonds. Wait, each H2 has one bond. So for 22 H atoms, that's 11 H2 molecules.

So 11 *100 kJ=1100.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is not starting from C and H2, but from other compounds. No, the problem states 'from elements in their standard states', which are C (graphite) and H2.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds have different bond energies. The problem says bond energy of C=C is 300 kJ/mol. So each double bond is 300.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of formation is the reverse calculation.

Wait, no, because the formation is from elements, which requires breaking their bonds and forming the compound's bonds.

Wait, but perhaps I have the formula reversed.

ΔHf° = (sum of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bonds formed in products).

Which I did: 13,100 -10,600=2500.

Wait, but if the value is negative, that would imply exothermic. But 2500 is positive, so endothermic.

Looking at the options, option A is 11200, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I've miscounted the number of C atoms. Let me recount.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each part:

(CH3)2C=CH- → 3 C (two CH3, one central) + CH →4 C.

CH2 →1 C.

CH(CH3) →1 C (CH) + 1 C (CH3) →2 C.

CH2 →1 C.

CH=C(CH3)2 →1 C (CH) +1 C (C) + 2 C (CH3) →4 C.

Wait, 4+1+2+1+4=12 C. Correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the molecule is C12H22, and perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation per mole as 2500 kJ, but the options don't have that, and perhaps I made a mistake in the counting of H or C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the entire molecule's formation but about something else.

Wait, the question states: "Calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2."

But perhaps I misread the structure. Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene derivative or something else, but the way it's written, it's a linear molecule with two double bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but that would change the structure.

Wait, no, the given formula has =C(CH3)2 at the end.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the molecule has 12 C and 22 H, so the formula is C12H22.

But with that, I can't see any error in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the formation of the molecule from elements, but from atoms. No, the standard enthalpy of formation is from elements in their standard states.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but in the options, B)67.4 is a small value, perhaps in kJ/mol, which is much lower than my calculation. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the number of moles of H2.

Wait, the molecule has 22 H atoms. Each H2 molecule provides 2 H atoms. So the number of H2 needed is 11.

But the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ per mole. So 11 *100 =1100 kJ.

But perhaps each H atom's energy is 50 kJ, so for 22 H atoms, 22 *50=1100 kJ. Which is the same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is the reverse: sum of product bonds formed minus sum of reactant bonds broken. But that would give a negative number, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are given as the energies released when bonds are formed, so the formula is sum of (reactant bond energies) - sum of (product bond energies).

Wait, no. The standard formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (bonds broken in reactants) - Σ (bonds formed in products).

But perhaps I have the formula reversed. Let me think.

The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from elements. So, breaking bonds in elements (endothermic) and forming bonds in compound (exothermic).

So, the total enthalpy is (energy required to break bonds in reactants) minus (energy released when forming bonds in product).

Which is what I did: 13,100 -10,600=2500.

But perhaps the correct approach is the other way around, which would give -2500, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the heat of combustion or something else.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I forgot to count the number of C-C bonds in graphite. Because in graphite, each C is bonded to multiple other C's. So breaking one C from graphite would require breaking multiple C-C bonds.

Wait, wait a minute! This is a crucial point. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of graphite to produce gaseous C atoms. So each mole of C in graphite has multiple C-C bonds.

The enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol of C. So for each mole of C, regardless of the number of bonds, it's 1000 kJ.

So, for 12 moles of C, it's 12*1000=12,000 kJ.

So that's correct.

Hmm.

Given that I can't find a mistake in my calculations, but the options don't match, perhaps the correct answer isn't even listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me look at the formula again.

The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to write this is as a bicyclic compound, but I don't think that's the case. It's a linear molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C=C bonds. Let's recount.

The molecule has two double bonds: (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

So two C=C bonds → correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies differently. For example, some sources use bond energies in kJ per bond, not per mole. But the question states they are in kJ/mol.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has more C-C single bonds than I thought. Let me try to count again.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each single bond between C's:

1. Between the central C and each CH3 →2.

2. Between the CH (from double bond) and CH2 →1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3) →1.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2 →1.

5. Between CH2 and CH (in CH=C) →1.

Total:6.

No, same as before.

At this point, I'm stuck. My calculation gives 2500 kJ/mol, which isn't an option. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in gaseous form, and the bonds are counted per molecule, not per mole. But that would change the calculation, but the problem states bond energies are per mole.

Wait, perhaps the number of H atoms is wrong. Let's recount.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has:

- Two CH3 groups →2*3=6 H.

- CH- →1 H.

Total:7.

Then CH2 →2.

CH(CH3) →CH (1) + CH3 (3) →4.

CH2 →2.

CH=C(CH3)2 →CH (1) + C(CH3)2 (2*3=6) →7.

Total:7+2+4+2+7=22.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the molecule is not C12H22. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes 4 C and 7 H.

CH2 contributes 1 C and 2 H.

CH(CH3):1 C (CH) +1 C (CH3) →2 C, and 1+3=4 H.

CH2:1 C, 2 H.

CH=C(CH3)2:1 C (CH),1 C (C), 2*3=6 H →4 C,7 H.

Wait, but adding all C:4 +1 +2 +1 +4 →12 C.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how to reach that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that only the double bonds are considered, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of combustion, not formation. But the question clearly states enthalpy of formation.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Given that, maybe the intended answer is option B)67.4, but I can't see the path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

Wait, how?

If the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Then, the backbone is:

C(1) (with two CH3) double bonded to C(2) (with CH), which is single bonded to C(3) (CH2), which is single bonded to C(4) (CH(CH3)), which is single bonded to C(5) (CH2), which is single bonded to C(6) (CH), which is double bonded to C(7) (C(CH3)2).

So the single bonds are between C(2)-C(3), C(3)-C(4), C(4)-C(5), C(5)-C(6).

Plus the two CH3 groups attached to C(1), which are two bonds.

So that's 6 single bonds.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the H's are not all from H2. But no, the problem requires that.

Hmm.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, perhaps option B)67.4 is the intended one, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond energies. Let me recompute:

Reactant bonds broken:

C:12 *1000=12,000.

H:11 *100=1,100.

Total:13,100.

Product bonds formed:

C-C:6 *200=1,200.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:22 *400=8,800.

Total:1,200+600=1,800; 1,800+8,800=10,600.

ΔHf=13,100-10,600=2,500.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts the C=C as single bonds, but the bond energy is 300 kJ per double bond. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ/g.

Molar mass is C12H22:12*12.01=144.12, 22*1.008=22.176 → total 166.296 g/mol.

So in kJ/g, it's 2500 /166.296 ≈ 15.01 kJ/g.

This isn't any of the options either.

Wait, option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is lower. How?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C and H.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has fewer C and H.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

No, that would change the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2.

In that case, the formula would be C11H20.

But let me recount.

But the given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Which has 12 C and 22 H.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended the molecule to have a different structure, leading to fewer C and H.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed.

But given the options, the only one that could make sense is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But I can't find a path to that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the C-C bonds.

Let me try again.

The molecule structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Number of single C-C bonds:

- Between C1 and C2 (double bond, not counted).

- C2 is connected to C3 → single bond.

- C3 connected to C4 → single.

- C4 connected to C5 → single.

- C5 connected to C6 → single.

- C1 connected to two CH3 groups (two single bonds).

So that's 5 single bonds from C2 to C6, plus two from C1's CH3.

Total:5 +2=7 single C-C bonds.

Wait, this is a new count. If there are 7 single C-C bonds, then:

7 *200 =1,400.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:22 *400=8,800.

Total formed:1,400+600+8,800=10,800.

ΔHf=13,100-10,800=2,300.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol.

But 67.4 is about (13,100 - 12, 432.6 =667.4 → but that doesn't fit).

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 5.

Wait, if I count 5 single C-C bonds: 5 *200=1,000.

Then:

1,000 +600 +8,800=10,400.

ΔHf=13,100-10,400=2,700.

No.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the problem confuses the number of moles of H2 as 22/2=11. So 11 *100=1,100.

But perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each H is bonded once, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer per mole of C, not per mole of the compound.

But that would make no sense.

Hmm.

After all this, I think the correct answer based on my calculation is 2500 kJ/mol, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't find the reasoning.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should have used the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the bonds in the product, but perhaps the molecule has more bonds than I thought.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-H bonds. Let's recount.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- Two CH3 →6 H.

- CH →1 H.

Total 7.

CH2 →2.

CH(CH3) →1 (CH) +3 (CH3) →4.

CH2 →2.

CH=C(CH3)2 →1 (CH) +6 (from two CH3) →7.

Total:7+2+4+2+7=22.

Yes.

Hmm.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, perhaps option B)67.4 is the intended choice, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂** using the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization. The enthalpy of formation is calculated as the energy required to break bonds in the reactants (elements in their standard states) minus the energy released when forming bonds in the product.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reactants (Elements in Standard States):**
   - **Carbon (C):** The enthalpy of atomization is given as **1000 kJ/mol**. Since the molecule contains **12 C atoms**, the total energy to break C-C bonds in graphite is:
     \[
     12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **Hydrogen (H):** The bond energy of H-H is **100 kJ/mol**. The molecule contains **22 H atoms**, which means **11 H₂ molecules** are required. The total energy to break H-H bonds is:
     \[
     11 \times 100 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **Total energy to break bonds in reactants:**
     \[
     12,000 + 1,100 = 13,100 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

2. **Product (Molecule):**
   - The molecule has the following bonds:
     - **C-C single bonds:** Counted as **6**, with each bond energy being **200 kJ/mol**:
       \[
       6 \times 200 = 1,200 \, \text{kJ}.
       \]
     - **C=C double bonds:** Counted as **2**, with each bond energy being **300 kJ/mol**:
       \[
       2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ}.
       \]
     - **C-H bonds:** Counted as **22**, with each bond energy being **400 kJ/mol**:
       \[
       22 \times 400 = 8,800 \, \text{kJ}.
       \]
   - **Total energy released when forming bonds in the product:**
     \[
     1,200 + 600 + 8,800 = 10,600 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

3. **Enthalpy of Formation:**
   The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Bonds broken in reactants} - \text{Bonds formed in product}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 13,100 - 10,600 = 2,500 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol):** This is much higher than the calculated value and is incorrect.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol):** This is significantly lower than the calculated value and does not match any plausible intermediate result.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g):** This is the enthalpy of formation per gram. The molar mass of the molecule is approximately **166.296 g/mol**, so the per gram value is:
  \[
  \frac{2,500}{166.296} \approx 15.01 \, \text{kJ/g}.
  \]
  This does not match **11.44 kJ/g**, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g):** This is far too high and incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **2,500 kJ/mol**, which does not match any of the provided options. Based on the given choices, none of the options are correct. However, if forced to choose, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** is the closest plausible answer, though the reasoning for this discrepancy is unclear.

ANSWER: B
