Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The compound is either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. I need to figure out which one based on the given 1H NMR data.

First, I should probably draw the structures of each possible compound to understand their NMR characteristics. Let me think about each structure.

Wait, propenyl and butenyl are types of alkenyl groups. Propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH₂ but with a double bond, right? So, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH₂- or something similar. But wait, propenyl is actually CH₂=CHCH₂- or maybe CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond in a different position? No, I think propenyl is CH₂=CH-CH₂- but as a substituent, so maybe CH₂=CHCH₂OAc for propenyl acetate.

Wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure would be R-O-CO-OAc? No, wait, no. Acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, acetate is OAc-O-R, so the ester is R-O-CO-OAc? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. Acetate ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So, the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me clarify: The ester of acetic acid is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3 for methyl esters. Wait, I'm getting confused. No, wait, acetate is the ester from acetic acid. So the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. So, the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the ester is usually R-O-COOR', where R' is the alkyl from the acid. So, since acetic acid is CH3COOH, R' is CH3. So the structure of the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH
