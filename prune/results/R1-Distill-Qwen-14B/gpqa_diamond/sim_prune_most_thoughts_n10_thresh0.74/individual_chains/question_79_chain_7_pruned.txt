Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and we need to find out what X was from the options provided.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane used for? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, no, Sharpless uses a titanium-based catalyst. Wait, no, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a ligand used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh wait no, actually, that's the structure of DBU maybe? Or wait, maybe it's part of the conditions for an epoxidation reaction. Because epoxidation involves forming an epoxide from a double bond. So the product here might be an epoxide.

But the question is about the starting material, compound X. Because the reaction is with that reagent, so perhaps X has a double bond that is epoxidized.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is given. So the product is an epoxide. So compound X must have a double bond which upon reaction became an epoxide. So X was probably an alkene. So the product is an epoxide.

Looking at the options, all the options except D have 'oxirane' in them, which is another name for epoxide. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. Wait, styryl is a benzene ring with an ethylene group attached. So perhaps the product is an epoxide derived from a styryl group.

Wait, but the product is after the reaction. So the reaction was epoxidation. So the product is the epoxide, which is the result of X being epoxidized.

So the options are all different epoxides, but we need to find which one, when reacted, would give the product with the given NMR
