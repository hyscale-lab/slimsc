Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in water) to form the corresponding butanoic acid.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When ketones react with cyanide ions, I remember that the cyanide can act as a nucleophile. Oh wait, but in what conditions? I think that for ketones reacting with CN-, it's a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be something like the carbonyl group (C=O) being attacked by the CN- ion, leading to the formation of an addition product.

Wait, but what happens next? Oh right, after the addition, you might get an elimination. But wait, no, because the product here is a nitrile and an alcohol. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe I should draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no, because NaCN is a source of CN-.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition followed by something else. Another thought: Could this be a condensation reaction? Or perhaps a substitution? Wait, no, substitution doesn't fit here.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yes, that's right! A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in a basic or acidic condition. The mechanism involves the attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, which then gets protonated, leading to the elimination of water, but in this case, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the cyanohydrin formation typically involves the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl, forming an intermediate that then has an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. So that would produce a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

So the product would have both an -OH and a CN group on the same carbon. That matches the first product, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So in this case, the butan-2-one (which has two methyl groups on the carbonyl carbon) adding CN- would give a structure where the same carbon (which was the carbonyl carbon) now has OH and CN groups, along with the two methyl groups.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with the substituents. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, butane is four carbons. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

CH2(CN)(OH)CH(CH3), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

(CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on the first carbon (since butanenitrile is CH2
