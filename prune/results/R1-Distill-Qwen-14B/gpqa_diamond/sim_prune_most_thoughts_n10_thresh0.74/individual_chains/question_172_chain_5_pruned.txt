Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). I need to find which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or perhaps another lower state) is different between the two stars. Let's denote the excited state as state 2 and the lower state as state 1. For star_1, the ratio n2/n1 is 2, and for star_2, it's let's say r, which I don't know yet. Wait, actually, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, or maybe I should think of it as star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2's. Hmm, perhaps I should model this properly.

Let me denote the ratio of the excited state (n2) to the lower state (n1) as R. So for star_1, R1 = n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, and for star_2, R2 = n2_2 / n1_2 = let's see, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps in star_2, the excitation is lower. So R1 = 2 and R2 = 1? Or maybe R1 is 2 times R2? Wait, that's not clear. Let's read the question again. It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation is twice as much. So perhaps n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n
