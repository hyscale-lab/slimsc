Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with toluene and ending up with product 3. Then, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3. The options are A to D, each a different symmetry group.

First, let's outline the reactions.

1. Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually happens under such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration adds a nitro group. Where does it add? Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration would occur in the meta position relative to the methyl group because methyl is an activating group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, methyl is an activating group, so it directs the incoming nitro group to the ortho and para positions. But nitration is a meta substitution? Or is it para?

Wait, no. Wait, the methyl group is ortho/para directing. So the nitration of toluene would result in nitro groups being added to the ortho, meta, or para positions of the methyl. But wait, nitration is a meta director? No, wait, nitration is a nitronium ion, which is a strong electrophile. Toluene's methyl is activating, so the nitration would occur at the ortho, para positions. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, toluene: benzene ring with a methyl group. Nitration adds a nitro group. Since the methyl is an activating group, the nitration occurs ortho, para. But in nitration, since it's a strong electrophilic substitution, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so the next substitution would be harder and meta, but in this case, the first product is only the nitration product.

So, the first product (Product 1) is nitrotoluene. The nitro group would be in the para position relative to the methyl group. Wait, but sometimes it's meta? No, wait, methyl is an activating group (donates electrons via the inductive effect?), so the nitration occurs at ortho and para. So the major product is para-nitrotoluene, but sometimes ortho forms are possible but less stable because of steric hindrance.

So, product
