Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are all powers of ten, so I just need to figure out which exponent is correct, probably in the range of 10^59 to 10^66 or so.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written with a factor of 1/4. So S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B?), or something like that. Let me get that right. The Planck area is l_p^2, and A is the area, so S is proportional to A/(l_p^2), but with some constants involved.

So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4 π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But how do I find r? Maybe using the angular size to find the radius first.

Angular size θ is related to the actual size (like diameter) and distance. The formula I think is θ ≈ d (2r) / (d), but wait, no. The relation is θ (in radians) ≈ (size)/(distance). So θ_rad ≈ size / d. Wait, but for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta in radians, so yes, theta ≈ (size) / d.

Wait, but the size in this case would be the diameter of the event horizon. Oh wait, the radius is r = (2 G M) / c^2, so diameter is 2 r = 2 (2 G M)/c^2. So diameter D = 4 G M / c^2.

So θ (in radians) = D / (4π d), wait no. Wait, the formula is θ ≈ (D) / (d), where
