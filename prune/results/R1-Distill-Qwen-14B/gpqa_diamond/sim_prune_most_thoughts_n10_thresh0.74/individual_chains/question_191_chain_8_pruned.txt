Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it involves a series of reactions. Let me read the question carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I think that's a cyclohexanone ring with substituents. Let me visualize it. The cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH attached to carbon 3). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2C=CH, but wait, more accurately, it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 1. So, structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane at position 5? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually (CH2)2C=CH2? No, wait: propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond starts at carbon 1, and the substituent is on carbon 2. So it's CH2=C(CH2)-. So substituent is CH2-CH(C)H2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=CHCH2- with the point of attachment at carbon 2. So the group is CH2-CH(CH2-)-, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's CH2=C-CH2, but with the substituent attached to the middle carbon. Wait, perhaps it's -CH2-C(CH2-)=CH2? No, perhaps I should think of the structure as (CH2CH2C=CH-), but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's (CH2)2C=CH2 attached as a substituent. Alternatively, maybe the group is isopropenyl? Like CH2=CHCH2-, but that's prop-1-en-1-yl. Wait, no, perhaps prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2-, but attached at the central carbon. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1, a hydroxymethyl at 3, and an isopropenyl group at 5. So, position 5 has CH2-C(CH2)=CH2 attached? Or maybe it's (CH2CH2C=CH2) attached at position 5.

Alright, moving on. The first step is treating this compound with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating compounds. In the presence of benzyl bromide, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, benzyl bromide is a good electrophile; maybe the compound has a proton that can be abstracted to form an alkoxide, which then attacks the benzyl bromide.

Looking at the starting material, where are the acidic protons? The hydroxymethyl group has an -OH, which is acidic. But under basic conditions, like with sodium hydride, the -OH would deprotonate to form an alkoxide. So, the -CH2OH would become -CH2O- which is a good nucleophile. Then, benzyl bromide (which is CH2CH2Ph-Br) would undergo an SN2 reaction with the alkoxide. So the benzyl group would attach to the oxygen.

Wait, but benzyl bromide is CH2Ph-Br. So, perhaps the reaction is a Williamson
