Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question gives six substances, each is a benzene ring with a substituent. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after bromination. Wait, increasing means the order from the one with the least para to the most. Got it.

Each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Oh right, substituents are either activating or deactivating, and they can be meta or para directors.

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Alkyl groups are ortho/para directors. So, when bromine adds, it'll attack ortho, para, and maybe meta, but more para and ortho.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no, wait. COOEt is an ester group. Wait, substituent here is OCO2Et (like a ester, O-CO-OEt)? No, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Wait, no: the substituent is -COOEt, which is an ester group. Esters are deactivating because the oxygen is more electronegative, so the substituent is meta-directing. Wait, wait! Actually, the ester group (-COOR) is a meta director. Because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So, when you have a substituent like that, the incoming electrophile goes to meta positions.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing up. Let me think. For substituents, activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR) are meta directors. So, in case 2, the substituent is -COOEt (ester), which is deactivating, so meta-directing. So bromine will add more in meta positions.

3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent is a chlorine atom. Chlorine is a bit tricky. It's an electronegative atom, so it's deactivating. But in what position does it direct? Chlorine can be ortho/para director. Wait, because it's an electron-withdrawing group but also has lone pairs which can donate electrons (though inductive effect is stronger). So, Cl is a meta director? No, wait. No, wait, Cl is a meta director for substitution. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directors. 

Nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta directors. Cl, though, is a deactivating substituent but an ortho/para director. Wait, no, wait, wait. No, actually, I think when the
