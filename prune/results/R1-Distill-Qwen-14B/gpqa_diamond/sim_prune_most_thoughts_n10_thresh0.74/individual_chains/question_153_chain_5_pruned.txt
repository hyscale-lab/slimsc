Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanisms, but let's think this through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each, then match them to the options given.

Starting with part (A): the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the base. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, so in this case, the nucleophile is probably the enolate of dimethyl malonate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form a stable enolate. The other reactant is the acrylate, which is the Michael acceptorâ€”so it's the electrophilic part.

When the enolate attacks the beta position of the acrylate, the product should be a new carbon-carbon bond. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups on either side of the carboxylate, so the enolate would form on the central carbon. Attacking the acrylate at the beta carbon would add the malonate's R group there.

So the structure of the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-OCH3 with the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the same carbon as the carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I should sketch it.

Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2
