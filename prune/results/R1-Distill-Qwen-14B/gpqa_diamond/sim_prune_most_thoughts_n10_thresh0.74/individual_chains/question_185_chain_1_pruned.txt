Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved here. Let me think back to what I know about Pauli matrices and Hamiltonians.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. And σ · n would be the dot product, so that's σx multiplied by nx plus σy multiplied by ny plus σz multiplied by nz. Oh, and since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1. That might come into play.

The Hamiltonian is H = ε times that sum. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I'd need to find the trace and determinant because for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ² - (trace)λ + determinant = 0.

Wait, but wait, the trace of H. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Let me see, each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero. Because, for example, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so trace is 0. Same for σy and σz. So H, which is a linear combination of these, will also have a trace of zero. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.

And the determinant of H? Hmm, because the determinant of a matrix product is the product of determinants. But wait, H is ε times (σ · n). Let me compute σ · n first. Let me denote σ · n as a matrix. The determinant of σ · n is something I should figure out.

Wait, for any Pauli matrix σi, its determinant is -1, because σi² = I, and determinant of I is 1. So the determinant of each σi is (det σi)² = det(I) = 1 → det σi = ±1. Wait, no, let me compute it. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Similarly, σy has determinant -1, and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], determinant is (1)(-1) - 0 = -1. Oh right, so each Pauli matrix has determinant -1.

But when you take a linear combination, the determinant isn't straightforward. Wait, no, the matrix σ · n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. Let me think about σ · n as a matrix. Let me write it out:

σ · n = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz.

Each term is a Pauli matrix scaled by some coefficient. So the matrix would look like:

[ nz   nx + i ny ]
[ nx - i ny  -nz ]

Wait, no, that's for σ · n when n has components (nx, ny, nz) and considering it as a spin operator in the n direction. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the matrix σ · n as a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the direction cosines.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the eigenvalues of σ · n. Because the eigenvalues of H would then just be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n.

So
