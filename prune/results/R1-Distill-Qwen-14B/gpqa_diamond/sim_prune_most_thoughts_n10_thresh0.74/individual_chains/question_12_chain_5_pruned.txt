Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see what the problem says.

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. And the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Wait, right, energy conservation says that the total energy before decay equals the total energy after. Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. On the right side, we have the muon and a neutrino. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus maybe its rest mass, but I think for this problem, we can treat the neutrino as massless.

So, the energies of the muon and the neutrino must add up to the pion's rest mass. Also, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. So, the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. But wait, since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c, but in units where c=1, it's just p. So, the muon's energy would be sqrt(p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4), but again, since we're using MeV and c=1, it's sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

So, putting this together. The total energy equation is:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2

But E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu is |p| (since for neutrino, E = |p| because m=0).

So,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, that's the equation we need to solve for p. Once we have p, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass. So for the muon, KE_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) - m_mu. And for the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, KE_nu is just p (since E_nu = p, and m_nu is zero). So the options give the KEs of the muon and neutrino, so I need to compute both.

Let me write the equation again:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

This looks a bit tricky to solve. Let me denote x = p. So:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

x² + 11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = (139.6)^2 - 279.2 x

Compute (139.6)^2: 139.6 * 139.6. Let me calculate that.

139.6 * 139.6. Let's compute 140^2 = 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and adjust because (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². Wait, no. Wait, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So,

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Rearranging:

279.2 x = 19488
