Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially when they're grounded, there are some specific things to consider. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, potential energy in such a system usually involves the work done to bring the charges together. Since the sphere is grounded, that probably means it's connected to the earth, so it can have charges induced on it but can also lose or gain charges as needed. Oh right, grounding allows the sphere to maintain an equilibrium, perhaps with the Earth's potential.

So, when you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. The charge q will induce an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and an equal and opposite charge on the far side. But wait, because the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute. I think the induced charge on the sphere's surface will be such that the potential on the surface is the same everywhere.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would go into the ground. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, no. If you bring a charge near a conducting sphere that's grounded, the sphere can't have a net charge because it can conduct away any excess. So the induced charges would be such that the sphere's
