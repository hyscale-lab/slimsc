Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I need to think about what I remember from my studies.

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts for different l values. The phase shifts are δ0=90 degrees, δ1=67 degrees, δ2=55, δ3=30, and δ4=13 degrees. Oh right, in scattering theory, each partial wave has a phase shift δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum number.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all these partial waves. I think the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ ( (k l)^(1/2) ) * ( sin(δ_l + lπ/2) - sin(lπ/2) ) * e^{i l θ} ) ], but wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's f(θ) = sum [ ( (2l+1)/(4π) ) * ( (sin δ_l)/δ_l ) * something ]? No, I think I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, I remember the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1)/(4π) ) [ ( (sin δ_l)/ ( δ_l + π/2) ) ] P_l(cosθ) ), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's f(θ) = sum ( (2l +1) P_l(cos θ) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) )/(k (2mE)^{1/2} (l +1/2)^{1/2} } ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh right, along the beam direction, θ is 0 degrees. So cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the amplitude simplifies to a sum over l of terms multiplied by 1.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ ( (2l +1) ) * ( (e^{i δ_l} - 1)/(2i) ) * ( (k l / (something) )^{1/2} ) ) ??? No, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, another approach. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(θ) is often related to the total cross-section. Oh wait, I recall that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to 4π |f|^2 averaged over all angles, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, but for the amplitude along the incident direction (θ=0), f(0) is the sum of the partial waves evaluated at θ=0. Let's think about each partial wave's contribution. Since θ=0, the spherical harmonics Y_{l,0} are real, so the amplitude will involve terms like e^{i l θ} = e^0 = 1, but I'm not entirely sure.

Another thought: the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = sum_{l=
