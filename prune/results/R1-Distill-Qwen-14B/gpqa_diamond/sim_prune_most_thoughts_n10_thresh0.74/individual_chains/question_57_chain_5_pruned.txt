Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. Oh wait, and we're told to ignore the rest, which I guess means l beyond 4 doesn't contribute, so we'll just consider these.

The problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) has a relation with the phase shifts, especially in the context of partial waves. 

So, the general formula for f(θ) in terms of phase shifts is a sum over all l of (something with spherical Bessel functions or Legendre polynomials, maybe?). But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the beam direction. Oh, right, when θ is 0 degrees, the direction of the incident beam. 

I think the expression for f(θ) when θ=0 might be simpler. Let me recall. Oh yes, for θ = 0°, the scattering is along the same direction as the incident beam, and the expression for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f(0) is given by:

Im f(0) = (2k/(π)) * sum over l [ (2l + 1) * sin(δ_l) ]

Wait, is that right? Or is it (2l+1) multiplied by sin δ_l? Oh, yes, because each partial wave contributes (2l+1) sin δ_l for the imaginary part when θ=0.

But wait, what's k in this context? Oh, k is the wave number of the electrons. The problem gives the energy as 50 MeV, so I need to compute k.

The relation between energy and wave number is E = (ħ²k²)/(2m). Let's compute that. But wait, I need to make sure about the units. Let's see, the energy is given in MeV, and I'm more familiar with units where mass is in atomic mass units and energies in MeV. 

So, the mass m is the mass of the electron, which is about 0.511 MeV/c². Oh wait, but let me think.
