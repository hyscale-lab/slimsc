Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the phenyl ring are a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, okay, numbering the ring: if the ketone is at position 1, then bromo is position 3, and nitro is position 5. Let me visualize that. So benzene with a ketone (as a substituent) at one position and bromo and nitro at the meta and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so let me sketch it mentally. The ketone is attached to the benzene, so that would be a phenyl ketone. So, the structure is:

Ph-CO-CH3? No, wait. The ketone is ethan-1-one, so it's (Ph)COCH3. Wait, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, ethan-1-one is CH3CO- as a substituent. Oh wait,
