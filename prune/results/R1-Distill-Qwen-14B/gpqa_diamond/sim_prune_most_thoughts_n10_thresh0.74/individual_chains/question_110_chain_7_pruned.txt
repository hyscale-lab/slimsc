Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I've got five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each spectrograph can detect in terms of star brightness. The problem says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait, I think I got that right. Oh wait, noâ€”the wording says "brighter than 17 mag," which I think means the apparent magnitude must be less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude (m_v) is less than 17, then it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, m_v has to be less than 16. So a star must be brighter than 16 mag for HIRES to detect it.

Now, each star's properties are given. I need to calculate their apparent magnitudes (m_v) and see which ones are bright enough for both spectrographs.

Wait, but some stars have absolute magnitudes (M_v) instead of apparent. Oh right, because the absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. So the apparent magnitude (m) can be found using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

But wait, some stars also have extinction (E(B-V)), which affects apparent magnitude. Oh right, because interstellar dust absorbs and scatters light, making stars appear dimmer and redder. The formula for extinction in V band (A_v) is A_v = R * E(B-V), where R is about 3.1. So the observed m_v is the intrinsic m_v plus A_v.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the formula is m_observed = m_true + A_v. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So if a star's true m_v is 15, and A_v is 1, then m_observed is 16.

So I'll have to adjust for
