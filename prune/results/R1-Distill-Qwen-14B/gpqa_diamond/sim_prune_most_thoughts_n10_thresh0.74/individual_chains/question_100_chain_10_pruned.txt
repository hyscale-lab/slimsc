Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A, which is C3H6. Then it goes through bromination, reaction with alcoholic KOH, and so on. I need to figure out each step and then identify which statement about the products is incorrect.

First, let's see. Compound A is C3H6. The molecular formula for propane is C3H8, but wait, C3H6 could be propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But wait, in the presence of CCl4 for bromination, usually that's a substitution reaction, like for alkenes. So propene would brominate via an addition reaction, maybe. Oh wait, no, wait: wait, bromination in CCl4 is for alkenes adding Br2. So if A is propene (C3H6), which is an alkene, then bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. So then compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, right? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the addition is across that.

Wait, but wait: another possibility is that if it's in CCl4, maybe it's a substitution reaction. No, no, substitution usually needs a different catalyst, like FeBr3 for aromatic substitution. If A is an alkene, then bromination with Br2 in CCl4 is an addition reaction. So yes, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next step: compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, which usually indicates an elimination reaction. So elimination of HBr. So from 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form an alkene again. But wait, wait, which positions would it eliminate from? Let's think. 1,2-dibromopropane is BrCH2CHBrCH3. When KOH (alcoholic) is added, it will deprotonate and eliminate HBr. The possible elimination products are from adjacent bromines. So eliminating one Br from each adjacent C.

Wait, wait: the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when elimination occurs,
