Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says: For a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, with small m (orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1T, compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom which has a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

Wait, I remember that the paramagnetic coupling term comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, but wait, the problem mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, which is for orbital angular momentum. Oh, so maybe it's the orbital contribution, but wait, paramagnetism is usually about spin, right? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Oh wait, the term might refer to the Zeeman effect, which deals with orbital and spin contributions, but paramagnetic coupling specifically is spin-related.

Wait, but the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling. Or maybe it's the perturbation due to the magnetic field. Oh wait, no, paramagnetic coupling is when an atom's electrons, due to their spin, interact with an external magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian term would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the z-axis, the term simplifies to something involving m (the magnetic quantum number) times B.

Wait, but m here is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m_l. But paramagnetic effects are more about spin, m_s. Hmm, but maybe the problem is considering orbital contributions. Not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the orbital term for now.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about the Balmer series in hydrogen, corresponding to the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait,
