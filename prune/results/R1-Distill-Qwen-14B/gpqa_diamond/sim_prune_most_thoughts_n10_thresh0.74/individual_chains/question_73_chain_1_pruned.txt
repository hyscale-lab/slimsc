Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity. 

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Let me break this down. First, the relative speed. Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula. But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, I think the formula is a bit different than if they were approaching each other. 

The formula for relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait no, actually, wait. Let me think. If object A is moving at u and object B is moving at v, both in the same frame, then the speed of B relative to A would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)). Or is it (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) depending on the direction. Since both are in the positive x-direction, and I'm looking for the speed of the second astronaut relative to the first. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6
