Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Let me try to break this down step by step. I remember from my notes that NMR spectroscopy can give a lot of structural information, so starting with that might help.

The problem says that compound A has two signals in its proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what kind of structure gives such signals? The triplet at low ppm (0.9) probably indicates methyl groups attached to something that causes splitting. Since it's 6H, maybe it's two methyl groups, each with three H's. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—wait, quartet suggests each proton is split into four, so maybe it's a -CH2-CH2- group, right? Because each CH2 is adjacent to another. Oh wait, but 4H would mean two CH2 groups. So maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something that causes it to split into a quartet. Or perhaps it's part of a larger structure.

Wait, looking at typical NMR patterns, the triplet at 0.9 for 6H is often indicative of two equivalent methyl groups attached to a CH2. Like in diethyl something. For instance, diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups, but in that case, the CH2 would be around 1.2 ppm as a quartet. But wait, wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 would show up as a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. But in our case, the CH2 is at 1.3 and is a quartet, and the CH3 is at 0.9 as a triplet. That seems to fit with diethyl ether. So maybe compound A is diethyl ether.

But wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So the O is connected to two CH2CH3 groups. The protons on CH3 would be triplet because they're next to the CH2, which has two protons. The protons on CH2 would be quartet because each is next to another CH2 with two protons. That makes sense. So yes, compound A is diethyl ether.

Then, compound A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. Monobromination of diethyl ether—bromine would probably substitute one of the ethyl groups, but wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So where does bromine add? Bromination of ethers typically can occur via an SN2 mechanism if possible, but diethyl ether is a tertiary ether, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps under acidic conditions, the ether can form a carbocation, and then bromide can attack.

Wait, but diethyl ether is a good nucleophile? No, ethers are generally poor nucleophiles. Oh wait, perhaps bromine adds across the oxygen? No, that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's a free radical bromination. Diethyl ether can undergo bromination under certain conditions, like in the presence of light, where a hydrogen is abstracted, leading to a bromine substitution.

But wait, diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. So if one of the CH2CH3 groups undergoes substitution, say, replacing a hydrogen with Br. But which H? The CH2CH3 groups have a terminal CH3 and a central CH2. The central CH2 would be more reactive because it's more substituted, perhaps.

Wait, but wait, when diethyl ether undergoes bromination, it's more likely to occur via a radical mechanism. In that case, the most stable radical would form. So, if a hydrogen is abstracted from the CH2CH3 group, which position would form the most stable radical? Probably the more substituted position. Let me think: abstracting a hydrogen from the central CH2 would give a secondary radical, but if from the CH3, it's primary. So maybe the CH2 is more likely to lose a hydrogen, leading to the radical at the CH2.

Wait, but in diethyl ether, the structure is O(CH2CH3)2.
