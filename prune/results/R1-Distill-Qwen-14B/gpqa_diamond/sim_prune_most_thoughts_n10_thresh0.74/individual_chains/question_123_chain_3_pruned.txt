Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through. 

The question says that a supernova's ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration between them. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, and from their own frame, they see the Galaxy moving towards them. But since both are inertial, their relative velocity is straightforwardâ€”right? So the question is about time dilation or length contraction maybe?

Wait, the problem is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So time is different in the two frames because of relativity.

I remember that time dilation depends on the relative velocity. The formula is t' = gamma * t, but wait, I might get confused. Alternatively, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But here, the events are the time passing in each frame.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the two frames. The Galaxy and the ejecta are moving relative to each other. Let me denote their velocities.

Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta
