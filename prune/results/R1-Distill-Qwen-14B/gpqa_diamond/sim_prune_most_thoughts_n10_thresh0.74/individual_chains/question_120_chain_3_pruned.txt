Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). The formula is p = 1/d, but I think it's in parsecs. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about how that would change with distance. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density is the same throughout space, right? So more stars would be at larger distances because they're spread out uniformly. But wait, no. If they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is constant. So as you go to larger distances, the volume increases, so the number of stars increases as well.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is 1/d, so as d increases, p decreases. Let me model this.

Suppose I consider a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Since the number density (stars per unit volume) is uniform, say n, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

Now, I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait
