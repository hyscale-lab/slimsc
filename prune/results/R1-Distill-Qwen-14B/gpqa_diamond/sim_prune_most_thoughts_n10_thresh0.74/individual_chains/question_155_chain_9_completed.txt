Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ − ⟨P⟩²), right? So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as the column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so this state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That should make things easier because when a state is in an eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value of that operator is just the eigenvalue.

But wait, no, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh right, because the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the state can be expressed as a linear combination of P_z's eigenstates. So I have to find the coefficients of each basis vector in the given state and then use them to compute the expectation values.

Let me write down the state vector. The given state is a column vector [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of this vector corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate of P_z.

So the eigenstates of P_z are |+⟩, |0⟩, |−⟩, corresponding to the eigenvalues +ħ, 0, and −ħ respectively. Because the matrix form for P_z is diag(ħ, 0, −ħ), right? So the first basis vector is |+⟩, second |0⟩, third |−⟩.

The given state is a linear combination of these. So the state is (−1/2)|+⟩ + (1/√2)|0⟩ + (−1/2)|−⟩.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is calculated as the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So ⟨P_z⟩ = |−1/2|^2 * ħ + |1/√2|^2 * 0 + |−1/2|^2 * (−ħ).

Calculating each term:
|−1/2|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So first term: (1/4) * ħ = ħ/4.
Second term: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, multiplied by 0 is 0.
Third term: (1/4) * (−ħ) = −ħ/4.

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 − ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just P_z multiplied by itself, but since P_z is diagonal in its eigenbasis, P_z² would have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (−ħ)^2, which are all ħ², 0, and ħ² respectively.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the squared eigenvalues. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |−1/2|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |1/√2|^2 * 0 + |−1/2|^2 * (ħ)^2.

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.
Second term: (1/2)*0=0.
Third term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = (1/2)ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2)ħ² - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I do that right? Because sometimes I get confused between the operator and the eigenvalues. Oh wait, yes, because P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue, so for each component, the square is taken.

So the calculation looks correct. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ divided by root 2.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$, $\langle P_z \rangle$
The given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$ as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)|+\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)|-\rangle,
\]

where $|+\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-\rangle$ correspond to the eigenvalues $+\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ of $P_z$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{4}$.
- $\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = -\frac{\hbar}{4}$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Calculating each term:
- $\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the first term is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.
- $\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, so the second term is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, so the third term is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
