Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and figure it out step by step. 

The question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that's too important for solving this. The key points are that there are five planets in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They also have the same albedo, and the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature when a planet is in orbit around a star. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since all planets have the same albedo here, that part cancels out.

The formula I think is something like Te = T_eff * (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but wait, maybe more simply, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, no. Wait, the distance plays a role. Because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (P² ∝ a³).

So, combining these concepts, the equilibrium temperature Te for a planet is given by:

Te = T_star * (R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but in this case, the planets are in a system, so T_star and R_star are the same for all. Also, the problem states that albedo (A) is the same for all, so A is the same. So that term (1-A) cancels out. And assuming e (eccentricity) is zero for all planets since orbits are circular, so that's 1. So the only variables are the distance (a) and the star's parameters.

Wait, but since the star is the same for all, the ratio of temperatures between the planets will only depend on the a of each planet.

So, since all have same albedo and same star, the equilibrium temperature ratio will be proportional to (1/a)^(1/4), because:

Te ∝ (1 / a)^(1/2) ? Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula: 

Te = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4)

Where d is the distance from the star. So, Te is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4), because L, A, and σ are constants.

But since d is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law, which is P² ∝ a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, d is proportional to a, which is P^(2/3), so d ∝ P^(2/3).

So substituting into the Te equation, Te ∝ (1/(P^(2/3)))^(1/4) = P^(-2/(3*4)) )= P^(-1/6).

Wait, let me re-calculate that exponent. So d ∝ P^(2/3). So 1/d ∝ P^(-2/3).

Then, 1/d^(1/4) = (1/d)^(1/4) = [ P^(-2/3) ]^(1/4 ) = P^(-2/(3*4)) ) = P^(-1/6).

So Te is proportional to P^(-1/6).

So, the equilibrium temperature of each planet is inversely proportional to P^(1/6).

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed up a step. Let me double-check. Let me write the steps again.

1. Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3).
2. The distance d is proportional to a, so d ∝ P^(2/3).
3. The equilibrium temperature formula: Te = [ (L (1-A)) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4)
4. Since L, A, σ are same for all, Te ∝ 1/d^(1/2)
5. Substituting d ∝ P^(2/3), so 1/d ∝ P^(-2/3)
6. Thus, Te ∝ (1/d)^(1/2) = (P^(-2/3))^(1/2) = P^(-1/3)

Wait, that's different from what I said before. So earlier, I think I made a miscalculation with the exponents.

Wait, no. Let me think: Te is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4), right? Because the formula is (1/d²) inside, so when you take the 1/4 power, it's (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So yes, Te ∝ 1/d^(1/2).

So, since d ∝ P^(2/3), 1/d^(1/2) = (P^(-2/3))^(1/2) = P^(-1/3).

Ah, so Te is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the equilibrium temperature decreases as the orbital period increases, and the exponent is -1/3.

Wait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm. Let me get this right.

Wait, correct formula for equilibrium temperature is Te = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Because the flux received is L / (4 π a²), and the planet emits as a blackbody with area π R_p² (but for equilibrium, the cross-section area is π R_p², and the emission is from the whole surface, 4 π R_p²). So the energy balance is (L (1 - A) )/(16 π σ a² ) = Te^4.

So, yes, Te is proportional to (1 / a )^(1/4). Because 1/a² inside, and the 1/4 power makes it 1/a^(1/2). Wait no, wait: (1/a²)^(1/4) is 1/a^(2*(1/4)) = 1/a^(1/2). So Te ∝ 1/(a)^(1/2).

But from Kepler's law, a^3 ∝ P^2 → a ∝ P^(2/3). So substituting a into Te's formula:

Te ∝ (1/(P^(2/3)) )^(1/2) ) = P^(-1/3).

So yes, Te is proportional to P^(-1/3). So the temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Wait, so that's the key point. So, for two planets, the ratio of their temperatures will be (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3).

Wait no, wait. Let's clarify: if P increases, Te decreases. So if Planet 2 has a period P2 and Planet 4 has P4, the ratio Te4/Te2 is (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

But wait, let me get the order right. So, the formula is Te ∝ P^(-1/3). So Te4 = k * (P4)^(-1/3), Te2 = k * (P2)^(-1/3). So the ratio is Te4/Te2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, no, because (P4/P2)^(-1/3) is the same as (P2/P4)^(1/3). So if P4 is larger than P2, Te4 is smaller than Te2, which makes sense.

So, the ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, but I've got to calculate P4 and P2. The orbital period ratios are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 to 5.

Wait, let me list them:

Planet_1: Period P1 = 1 unit.

Planet_2: P2 = 2 units.

Planet_3: P3 = 2.5 units.

Planet_4: P4 = 3.5 units.

Planet_5: P5 = 5 units.

So, the ratio is P2 = 2, P4 =3.5.

So, Te4/Te2 = (2/3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, no, wait, because the formula is Te4/Te2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) because it's (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because Te is proportional to P^(-1/3), so Te4 = (P4)^(-1/3), Te2=(P2)^(-1/3).

So Te4/Te2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So, substituting P2=2, P4=3.5.

So, (2/3.5) is 2/(3.5) = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3).

What's the cube root of 4/7? Let me calculate that.

4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714. Hmm.

I know that cube root of 1 is 1.

Cube root of 0.729 is 0.9, because 0.9^3 is 0.729.

Cube root of 0.512 is 0.8, since 0.8^3=0.512.

So 0.5714 is between 0.512 and 0.729.

Compute 0.8^3=0.512, 0.82^3=approx 0.82 *0.82=0.6724, *0.82=approx 0.551.

Wait, 0.82^3 is about 0.551. 0.83^3 is 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, *0.83 ≈ 0.571.

Wait, that's exactly what we're looking for. So cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, let me compute 0.83^3:

0.83 * 0.83 = ?

Well, 83 *83 is 6889, so 0.83^2=0.6889.

0.6889 *0.83 = ?

Multiply 0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, and 0.6889 *0.03=0.020667.

Adding together: 0.55112 + 0.020667 = 0.571787.

Which is approximately 0.5718, which is very close to 0.5714.

So the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

So Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second, let me think again. Because the formula is (P2/P4)^(1/3), and P2=2, P4=3.5, so 2/3.5 is 4/7 ≈0.5714. The cube root of that is ~0.83, so the ratio is ~0.83.

So planet_4's temperature is 0.83 times planet_2's temperature.

Wait the question says, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

So that's Te4/Te2 = ~0.83.

So the options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So the answer would be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) of a planet is proportional to \( P^{-1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. This relationship arises because \( T_e \) depends on the distance from the star, which is related to \( P \) via Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \)), and the equilibrium temperature formula (\( T_e \propto a^{-1/2} \)).

Given the orbital periods of the planets in the ratio \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we assign the following periods:
- Planet_2: \( P_2 = 2 \)
- Planet_4: \( P_4 = 3.5 \)

The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:
\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \):
\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{2}{3.5} \):
\[
\frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
\]

Now, calculate the cube root of \( 0.5714 \). Approximating:
\[
(0.5714)^{1/3} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

From the given options:
- A) \( \sim 0.57 \)
- B) \( \sim 0.69 \)
- C) \( \sim 0.83 \)
- D) \( \sim 0.75 \)

The correct answer is **C**.
