Okay, so I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4 after a series of reactions. Let me try to work through each step carefully.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, with a six-membered ring where one of the carbons is a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the molecule has a ketone functional group.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Bromine is a dienophile, right? So this must be a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a diene. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another possibility is bromination via an enol. Or maybe the ketone undergoes a different reaction with bromine.

Wait, when ketones react with bromine, I think they can form a dibromide through the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone would add Br2 to the carbonyl, forming a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. But wait, in reality, ketones typically add bromine in a different way. Oh wait, no, more accurately, I think the carbonyl oxygen is attacked first, but maybe it's more likely to form a bromohydrin. Or perhaps bromine adds to the carbonyl. Let me think again.

Another possibility is that cyclohexanone undergoes a ring-opening reaction with bromine. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via an enol, but that usually requires an acid catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexanone isn't reacting as the diene in a Diels-Alder, but maybe it's acting as an enol. Wait, maybe not. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination via the enolate.

Wait, another thought: when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine under certain conditions, it can form an epoxide? No, that's with peracids. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide addition. Let me think. The carbonyl group in a ketone can undergo addition reactions. For example, under certain conditions, Br2 can add to the carbonyl, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Oh, wait, I think cyclohexanone would react with bromine in a nucleophilic addition. So Br2 would add across the carbonyl group, but that would require the formation of an
