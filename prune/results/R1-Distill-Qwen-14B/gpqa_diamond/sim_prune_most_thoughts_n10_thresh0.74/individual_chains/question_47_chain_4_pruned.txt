Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is correct based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what I've got.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree is (2n +2 -m -x* (O, but O doesn't contribute to degree) -p*(N, but same)) / 2. Wait, no, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Alternatively, for organic compounds, it's (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2 where X is halogens, which aren't present here.

So here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5 degrees. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (3), a carbonyl (1), and an amide or something else (another 1)? Hmm. Or perhaps a benzene ring, a carbonyl, and an ester linkage or something.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325. Those are broad, possibly N-H or O-H stretches. But the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is around where esters and amides appear. Esters are usually around 1740-1710. Amides are a bit lower, like 1680-1650, but maybe if it's an amide with electron-withdrawing groups, it could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but the molecular formula doesn't seem to fit a ketone. Let me think.

The 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet, likely a CH2CH2 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to another CH2. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative group, like O or N. Maybe an -OCH2- group or an -NHCH2- group. But since the IR doesn't show strong O-H or N-H, maybe it's an ether or something else. Wait, wait, but the IR did have those bands at 3420 and 3325. Those could be N-H stretches. So maybe there's an amide group or an amine.

Wait, the options are A) 3-ethoxybenzamide, B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, C) 4-aminophenyl propionate, D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3-ethoxy
