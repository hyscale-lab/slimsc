Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei fission. Hmm, I remember from my classes that fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. But this problem is a bit tricky because it's comparing relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations of kinetic energy. Alright, let's break this down.

The question says that the initial nucleus has a rest mass M with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It's at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. The more massive fragment is twice as massive as the other. So, let's denote the masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2. Wait, the problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if I let the smaller one be mass m, the larger would be 2m. But the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So M_initial = m + 2m = 3m, but wait no, actually, the sum is 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99/3) M. Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of fractions.

Let me think: the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But since one is twice the other, let's say m1 = 2x and m2 = x. Then x + 2x = 3x = 0.99 M → x = 0.33 M. So m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M. Wait, but the initial mass is M, and the sum of fragments is 0.99 M. So mass must have been converted into kinetic energy or maybe other forms like binding energy, but in this case, since the question is about kinetic energy, I think that's the key.

So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

The problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. The question is, what's the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to calculate T1 relativistically and then compute the same using the classical formula, then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the velocities and then the kinetic energies.

But wait, in relativity, energy and momentum are related through E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

But considering the system as a whole, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies. But since the nucleus was at rest, the total energy after fission must be the same as before, except for any binding energy, but I think in this problem, we're neglecting that, because it's a fission process and the binding energy is part of the rest mass. So the total energy after fission is the rest mass energy of both fragments plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest masses are 0.99 M, but wait wait, no: the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M, so their rest mass energy would be 0.99 * (300 GeV) = 297 GeV. But the initial energy is 300 GeV. So the difference would be 3 GeV, which is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments combined. Because energy is conserved, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments plus the rest mass energy of the two fragments equals the initial rest mass energy. So 297 GeV + T1 + T2 = 300 GeV. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, but that's only considering rest mass. But mass can't be created or destroyed, but in the problem, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the mass difference is 1% of M. So 1% of 300 GeV is 3 GeV. So that must be the total kinetic energy. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies are (1/2)m v². But in the relativistic case, it's (gamma - 1) m c².

So for each fragment, the momentum is p = gamma m v, and since p1 = -p2, the magnitudes are the same. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2, and since p2 is in the opposite direction, p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But because the velocities are opposite, perhaps it's better to consider their magnitudes. So |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the kinetic energies are determined by the velocities, which are related via conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this as a two-body problem where the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote the velocities as v and u, in opposite directions. Then their momenta are gamma1 m1 v and gamma2 m2 u. Since they're opposite, gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But because of the opposite directions, perhaps u = -v. Wait, no, because the velocities could be in opposite directions but not necessarily equal in magnitude. Hmm, but in reality, since the two fragments have different masses, their velocities would be different. So perhaps it's better to set up equations based on momentum conservation.

Let me denote v as the velocity of the more massive fragment (m1 = 0.66 M) and u as the velocity of the less massive (m2 = 0.33 M). Because momentum must be conserved, the total momentum before was zero, so m1 v = -m2 u. So m1 v = m2 u, because u is in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, the direction matters. Let's say fragment 1 (more massive) moves in +x direction with velocity v, fragment 2 (less) moves in -x direction with velocity u. So momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v, p2 = gamma2 m2 (-u). So for conservation, p1 + p2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can express u in terms of v. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the center of mass frame. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the center of mass of the two fragments must also be at rest, so their velocities are such that m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, that's true. But in the relativistic case, it's more complex because the momentum depends on gamma.

Wait, in the rest frame (the initial frame), the total momentum is zero. So the total relativistic momentum after fission must be zero. So p1 + p2 = 0.

So the magnitude of p1 equals the magnitude of p2.

So gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But since the two fragments move in opposite directions, their velocities are in opposite directions, so perhaps u = -(v') where v' is the speed of the second fragment in the same frame.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of speed. Let me denote the speed of fragment 1 as v and fragment 2 as u. Since their momenta are equal and opposite, gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u. But considering direction, perhaps u is in the opposite direction, so u = -v2, and the magnitude equation becomes gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since the system is symmetric except for mass, perhaps we can use the fact that the kinetic energies can be related through their velocities and masses.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the velocity using the total kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Let me compute the total relativistic energy.

Wait, but the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass is 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, as we said earlier.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

But wait, let's think about the relation between their kinetic energies. Let me denote T1 as the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Then T2 is the kinetic energy of the less massive. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But how are T1 and T2 related? Since their velocities are opposite, and their momentum must cancel, so perhaps their speeds are related by the masses.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, from momentum conservation, m1 v1 = m2 v2. So v2 = (m1/m2) v1. Since m1 is twice m2, v2 would be 2 v1. 

So in the non-relativistic case, T1 = 0.5 m1 v1², T2 = 0.5 m2 v2². Substituting v2 = (m1/m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1. So T2 = 0.5 m2 (2 v1)^2 = 0.5 m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

But since m1= 2 m2, m2 = m1 /2. So T2 = 2*(m1/2) v1² = m1 v1².

So T1 = 0.5 m1 v1², T2 = m1 v1².

So T1 + T2 = 0.5 m1 v1² + m1 v1² = 1.5 m1 v1² = 3 GeV → m1 v1² = 2 GeV.

But T1 is 0.5 m1 v1^2 = 1 GeV. So in the non-relativistic case, T1 would be 1 GeV.

But wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, in non-relativistic case, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Since m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

So T1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

T2 = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) )= 2 m2 v1².

So T1 + T2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

Then T1 = m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

So in non-relativistic, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, wait, earlier I thought T1 would be 1 GeV, but according to this calculation, yes.

But wait the initial total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So T1 is 1 GeV, T2 is 2 GeV. That makes sense because the more massive fragment has a lower speed, so its kinetic energy is less than the lighter fragment which moves faster.

But in reality, the relativistic case would have different values. So now, I have to calculate T1 relativistically.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So we can model each fragment's energy and momentum.

Let me denote for fragment 1:

E1 = gamma1 m1 c² = rest energy + kinetic energy → 0.66 M c² + T1.

Similarly, for fragment 2:

E2 = gamma2 m2 c² = 0.33 M c² + T2.

But wait, the rest mass of fragment 1 is 0.66 M, because m1 is 0.66 M. So rest energy is 0.66 M c². Similarly for fragment 2.

But in the initial frame, the total energy is 300 GeV, which is the sum of E1 and E2.

So E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Which is (gamma1 * 0.66 M c² + T1) + (gamma2 * 0.33 M c² + T2) ) = 300 GeV.

But since T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, perhaps I can write E1 + E2 = (0.66 M c² + gamma1 *0.66 M c²) + (0.33 M c² + gamma2 *0.33 M c²) ) = (0.66 + 0.33) M c² (1 + gamma1 + gamma2) ) = 0.99 M c² (1 + gamma1 + gamma2) ) + T1 + T2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, E1 = gamma1 * (m1 c²) = (m1 c²) (gamma1) = (0.66 M c²) gamma1.

Similarly, E2 = (0.33 M c²) gamma2.

So E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, 0.66 M c² gamma1 + 0.33 M c² gamma2 = 300 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, since initial rest energy is 300 GeV.

So this becomes 0.66 * (300 GeV) gamma1 + 0.33 * (300 GeV) gamma2 = 300 GeV.

Factor out 300 GeV:

300 GeV [0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 ] = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by 300 GeV:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

So,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

Additionally, from momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal. So p1 = p2.

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1.

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since they're moving in opposite directions, the momenta have equal magnitude but opposite signs. So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But also, velocities are related to gamma via:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach would be to consider that the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest energy.

So, T1 = E1 - m1 c² = (gamma1 m1 c^2) - m1 c² = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c^2.

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c^2.

We know T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 - 1) 0.66 M c² + (gamma2 - 1) 0.33 M c² = 3 GeV.

But M c^2 is 300 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 - 1) 0.66 * 300 GeV + (gamma2 - 1) 0.33 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

Compute 0.66 * 300 = 198 GeV, 0.33 *300=99 GeV.

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) + 99 (gamma2 -1) = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 3 GeV:

66 (gamma1 -1) + 33 (gamma2 -1) = 1.

Wait, 198 /3=66, 99/3=33.

So,

66 (gamma1 -1) + 33 (gamma2 -1) =1.

Expand:

66 gamma1 -66 +33 gamma2 -33 =1.

Combine like terms:

66 gamma1 + 33 gamma2 -99 =1.

→ 66 gamma1 + 33 gamma2 = 100.

But earlier, from the energy equation,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Multiply this equation by 33 to make the coefficients manageable:

(0.66 *33) gamma1 + (0.33 *33) gamma2 = 33.

Compute 0.66 *33 =21.78, 0.33 *33=10.89.

So,

21.78 gamma1 +10.89 gamma2 =33.

And from the previous equation:

66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =100.

So now we have two equations:

1) 21.78 gamma1 +10.89 gamma2 =33.

2) 66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =100.

Hmm, perhaps I can simplify these equations.

Let me note that equation 2 can be divided by 33:

2) 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.0303.

Equation 1:

21.78 gamma1 +10.89 gamma2 =33.

Hmm, 21.78 is approximately 2 *10.89. Because 10.89 *2 =21.78.

So equation 1 can be written as:

2 *10.89 gamma1 + 10.89 gamma2 =33.

Factor out 10.89:

10.89 * (2 gamma1 + gamma2) )=33.

But equation 2 is 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33.

So substituting:

10.89 * (100/33) =33.

Check: 10.89 * (100/33) = (10.89 * 100)/33 ≈1089/33=33. So yes, 10.89 *100/33=33.

So equation 1 is satisfied by equation 2.

Therefore, the two equations are dependent, and so we can only proceed with one equation: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33 ≈3.0303.

So we can write gamma2 = (100/33) - 2 gamma1.

Now, let's try to find another equation involving gamma1 and gamma2.

We also have that the momenta are equal in magnitude.

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1.

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And from momentum conservation, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But v1 and v2 are related via the direction. Since the fragments move in opposite directions, perhaps v2 is in the opposite direction. So v2 = -v1'. But the magnitudes are positive, so |v1| and |v2| are positive. So the equation becomes:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But I'm not sure about the signs. Alternatively, perhaps the speed magnitudes are related.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that p1 = -p2, so the magnitudes are equal. So:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the directions are opposite, perhaps v2 = -v1, but the magnitudes are positive. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1 using the momentum equation.

Another approach is to express v in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, p = gamma m beta c.

So, for fragment 1, p1 = gamma1 m1 beta1 c.

Fragment 2, p2 = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal.

So gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Cancel c: gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

So,

(gamma1 m1) beta1 = (gamma2 m2) beta2.

But I don't know the relationship between beta1 and beta2. Since the masses are different, their betas may not be the same.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the velocities are such that the kinetic energy is a certain fraction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the problem is about the difference between relativistic and classical T1, perhaps the difference is small, so we can approximate.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy might be a bit higher because of relativistic effects. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the kinetic energy is lower. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about a different approach. Since the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, and the non-relativistic case gives T1=1 GeV, perhaps in the relativistic case, T1 is higher, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's consider that in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies are T1=1 GeV and T2=2 GeV.

But in reality, because the fragments are moving at speeds where relativistic effects are important, their kinetic energies would be higher than the non-relativistic case. Because in the non-relativistic case, KE is (1/2)mv², but in the relativistic case, the KE increases with velocity.

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, and the fragments are moving apart. The kinetic energy comes from the mass deficit, which is 3 GeV. So the total KE is 3 GeV. So whether each fragment's KE is higher or lower than the non-relativistic case depends on their velocities.

But perhaps for the more massive fragment (m1=0.66 M), its relativistic KE (T1) is higher than the non-relativistic case because gamma is greater than 1. Similarly for the lighter fragment.

But how much higher?

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the velocities such that the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV, and the momentum is conserved.

Let me think about this. Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

But m1 = 0.66 M, m2 =0.33 M.

So,

gamma1 *0.66 M * beta1 = gamma2 *0.33 M * beta2.

The M cancels, so:

0.66 gamma1 beta1 = 0.33 gamma2 beta2.

Simplify: 2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So equation: gamma2 beta2 =2 gamma1 beta1. → equation (A)

Now, the kinetic energy sum:

T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

m1 c² =0.66 M c² = 0.66 *300 GeV=198 GeV.

So T1 = (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = (gamma2 -1) * 99 GeV (since m2 c² is 0.33 *300=99 GeV).

So,

198 (gamma1 -1) +99 (gamma2 -1) =3.

Divide both sides by 3:

66 (gamma1 -1) + 33 (gamma2 -1) =1.

Which simplifies to:

66 gamma1 -66 +33 gamma2 -33 =1 →66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =100.

Divide both sides by 33:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.0303. → equation (B)

So now, from equation (A):

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But beta = v/c, so perhaps I can express beta in terms of gamma. Because beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

beta2 = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2^2)).

Substituting into equation (A):

gamma2 * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2^2)) * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)) ) = 2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

Wait, no, equation (A) is:

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

So,

gamma2 * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2^2)) = 2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma1^2)).

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

So,

gamma2^2 (1 - 1/gamma2^2) ) =4 gamma1^2 (1 - 1/gamma1^2).

Simplify:

gamma2^2 ( (gamma2^2 -1)/gamma2^2 ) ) =4 gamma1^2 ( (gamma1^2 -1)/gamma1^2 )).

Simplify left side: (gamma2^2 -1) = right side: 4 (gamma1^2 -1).

So,

gamma2^2 -1 =4 (gamma1^2 -1).

→ gamma2^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3 → equation (C).

Now, from equation (B):

gamma2 = (100/33) - 2 gamma1.

So,

gamma2 = (100/33) - 2 gamma1.

So plug this into equation (C):

( (100/33) - 2 gamma1 )^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Expand the left side:

(100/33)^2 - 2*(100/33)*(2 gamma1) + (2 gamma1)^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

→ (100/33)^2 - (400/33) gamma1 +4 gamma1^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Subtract 4 gamma1^2 from both sides:

(100/33)^2 - (400/33) gamma1 = -3.

Multiply both sides by 33^2 to eliminate denominators:

100^2 - 400 *33 gamma1 = -3 *33^2.

Calculate each term:

100^2 =10,000.

400 *33 =13,200.

So,

10,000 -13,200 gamma1 = -3*1089= -3267.

Bring all terms to one side:

10,000 +3267 =13,200 gamma1.

→13,267 =13,200 gamma1.

So,

gamma1 =13,267 /13,200≈1.005053.

Hmm, that's very close to 1. So gamma1 is approximately 1.005.

Then, from equation (B):

gamma2= (100/33) - 2 *1.005053.

100/33 ≈3.0303.

So,

gamma2 ≈3.0303 - 2.0101 =1.0202.

So gamma1 ≈1.00505, gamma2≈1.0202.

Now, let's compute T1 and T2.

T1= (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV.

gamma1-1 ≈0.00505.

0.00505 *198 ≈1.0049 GeV.

So T1≈1 GeV.

Similarly, T2= (gamma2 -1) *99 GeV.

gamma2-1≈0.0202.

0.0202 *99 ≈2 GeV.

So T1≈1 GeV, T2≈2 GeV.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, T1 is also 1 GeV, and T2 is 2 GeV. So the relativistic case gives the same result? That can't be right. Because relativistic calculations are supposed to give different results from non-relativistic ones.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the approximation. Let's compute gamma1 and gamma2 more accurately.

Wait, gamma1 was 13,267 /13,200.

13,200 is 132 *100, 13,267 is 132 *100 +67.

So, 13,267/13,200 =1 + 67/13,200 → 67/13,200 ≈0.00507576.

So gamma1≈1.00507576.

gamma2= (100/33) - 2 *1.00507576 ≈3.030303 -2.0101515 ≈1.0201515.

Now, T1 = (gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

Which is 0.00507576 *198 ≈1.0049 GeV.

Similarly, T2=(gamma2-1)*99 =0.0201515 *99≈2 GeV.

So, T1≈1.0049 GeV, which is approximately 1 GeV, same as the non-relativistic case.

So the difference between relativistic and classical T1 is about 0.0049 GeV, which is 4.9 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the options are A)2MeV, B)5MeV, etc. So this would be approximately 5 MeV.

But wait, wait, in my initial calculation, I assumed that the sum of the kinetic energies is 3 GeV. But in reality, the rest mass of the system is 0.99 M, so the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The total energy after fission is E1 + E2 = (gamma1 m1 c^2) + (gamma2 m2 c^2) ) =300 GeV.

But the rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M c^2 =297 GeV.

So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is correct.

But according to the calculation, the relativistic T1 is approximately 1.0049 GeV, which is about 1.005 GeV, compared to the non-relativistic T1 of 1 GeV.

So the difference is about 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV and the relativistic is 1.005 GeV, but wait, that would make the relativistic T1 higher. So the difference would be 0.005 GeV which is 5 MeV.

But wait, the calculation showed that the relativistic T1 is slightly higher than the classical value. So the difference is 5 MeV.

But wait, wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical approximation."

So if the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV and the classical T1 is1 GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So the answer should be 5 MeV, option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic mechanics. The initial nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments have rest masses \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \), with the total rest-mass energy of the fragments being \( 0.99M c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \). The remaining energy, \( 300 \, \text{GeV} - 297 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), is the total kinetic energy of the two fragments, i.e., \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Non-Relativistic Case
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy of each fragment is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). Using momentum conservation (\( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \)), the velocities of the two fragments are related as \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). Substituting into the kinetic energy expressions:
\[
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2, \quad T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_1^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.33M \cdot (2v_1)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = T_1.
\]
Thus, \( T_1 + T_2 = T_1 + 2T_1 = 3T_1 \), and solving \( 3T_1 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) gives \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Case
In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy of each fragment is given by \( T = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Using momentum conservation (\( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \)) and the fact that \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we find \( \gamma_2 \beta_2 = 2\gamma_1 \beta_1 \), where \( \beta = v/c \). Additionally, the total energy conservation equation is:
\[
\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Substituting \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \), and simplifying, we solve for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \). After detailed calculations, we find:
\[
\gamma_1 \approx 1.00505, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0202.
\]
The kinetic energies are then:
\[
T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m_1 c^2 = (1.00505 - 1) \cdot 198 \, \text{GeV} \approx 1.0049 \, \text{GeV},
\]
\[
T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) m_2 c^2 = (1.0202 - 1) \cdot 99 \, \text{GeV} \approx 2.0002 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus, \( T_1 \approx 1.0049 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical \( T_1 \)
The non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( T_1 \) is approximately \( 1.0049 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1.0049 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.0049 \, \text{GeV} = 4.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
This is approximately \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.
