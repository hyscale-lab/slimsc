Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about gamma-ray photons annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-.

The problem is asking for the energy at which the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. The options are four different energies in GeV, so I need to figure out which one it is. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. 

Wait, I think I remember something about photon-photon interactions and the cross-section. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that a particular interaction will occur. For high-energy gamma-rays, the cross-section for this annihilation process should depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the energy of the CMB photon.

I think the cross-section formula for photon-photon annihilation is something like sigma ~ (sigma_0) * (E_photon * E_gamma) / (m_e^2 c^4), where sigma_0 is some constant. Or wait, maybe it's more precise. Oh right, the cross-section for gamma gamma to e+ e- is given by the formula:

σ = (σ_0) * (E1 * E2) / (m_e^2 c^4)

Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. But wait, actually, I think the cross-section formula might be proportional to (s) where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or perhaps considering the threshold energy. Let me think.

The threshold energy for this process (γγ → e+ e-) is when the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is just enough to produce the electron and positron. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so 1.022 MeV in total. But wait, actually, when you have two photons colliding, the threshold condition is when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is equal to 2m_e c^2. So each photon needs to have enough energy to contribute to that.

Wait, but in the lab frame, one of the photons is the gamma-ray (high energy) and the other is the CMB photon (low energy, 1e-3 eV). So the cross-section depends on the product of their energies. Because the CMB photon is at a much lower energy, maybe the gamma-ray's energy is what's critical.

Another thing I remember is that the optical depth tau, which determines whether a photon is likely to annihilate before traveling a certain distance, is given by the product of the cross-section and the number density of the target photons. The optical depth is tau = n_target * sigma * L, where L is the length over which the interaction occurs.

In cosmology, the mean free path lambda is the inverse of the product of the cross-section and the photon density. So if tau = 1, that's when the probability of interaction is about 37% (since e^(-tau) is the survival probability, so when tau is 1, about 63% have survived, meaning 37% have interacted). So when tau approaches 1, the photon's lifetime is limited by this process.

So the lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the optical depth is about 1. So the condition is tau ≈ 1.

Let me get the formula. The cross-section for this process is given by:

σ = (4π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (x^2) 

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

σ = (4π α^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E1 E2) / (m_e c^2)^2 ?

Wait, maybe another approach. The cross-section
