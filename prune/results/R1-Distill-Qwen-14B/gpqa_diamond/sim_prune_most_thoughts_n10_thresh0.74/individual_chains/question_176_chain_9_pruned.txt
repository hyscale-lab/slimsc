Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's normalized? Let me check. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the magnitude squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state vector's squared norm is 6. Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning their norm is 1. So maybe I should normalize this vector first. Oh, but the question doesn't mention that. Hmm, but I guess I should proceed with the given vector, but perhaps I should consider that maybe it's already normalized. Wait, but 6 isn't 1, so maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the problem assumes normalization. Alternatively, perhaps the state is given as (-1, 2, 1) divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. I'll proceed under that assumption because otherwise, it wouldn't make sense for probabilities.

Wait, the problem statement says the state is the column matrix ( -1, 2, 1). So perhaps I need to normalize it. Let me compute the norm. The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ). So that's the actual state.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Operator Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1.

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1. The probabilities depend on the state vector.

Wait, but the question is about measuring P and then Q. So first, the system is in state |ψ⟩, and someone measures P, getting a certain outcome, then measures Q, getting another outcome. But the question asks for the probability of P being 0 and Q being -1. Oh, but wait, the order is a bit tricky. The measurement of P first, then Q. So the state of the system after measuring P would be an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that state.

Wait, but the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P"—so it's P first, then Q. So the process is: measure P, which collapses the state into an eigenstate of P. Then measure Q on that state.

Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, the state after measuring P will be
