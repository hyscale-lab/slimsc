Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an organic chemist performs two reactions. Each reaction involves a different starting material and a different reagent, and then both products are combined. They're then analyzed using HPLC columnsâ€”both a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks the chemist would see in each case.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3 (since it's hexan-3-one). The structure would be CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So structure is: CH2CH2 groups on either side. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? Wait, no, hexane has six carbons. Hexan-3-one would be: CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait let's count. Carbon 1, 2, 3, etc.

Hexan-3-one structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, more accurately, it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps better to write it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Wait no, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is: the ketone is on carbon 3, and there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C-OCH3 is on C5.

Wait, let me write it out:
