Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given information is that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_CA-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So when Ca-EDTA is present, the calcium is bound up in the complex, right? So the free calcium concentration should be really low because most of the Ca is tied up in the complex.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Oh, stoichiometric means that the molar ratio is 1:1 between Ca and EDTA. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex.

I think the formula for the formation constant (Kf) is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, the problem gives K_CA-EDTA as 5x10^10, so that's our Kf.

Wait, but in solution, the EDTA and Ca²+ are in equilibrium with the complex. So if the complex is 0.02 M, I can set up an equation.

Let me think. Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. The free calcium concentration is [Ca²+] = x, and the free EDTA concentration is [EDTA^4-] = y. But wait, because for every mole of CaEDTA that dissociates, it gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and some dissociates, x = y.

Wait no, because the initial concentrations before complexation would have been [Ca²+] and [EDTA], but when they form the complex, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are both decreasing. But in a 1:1 ratio, so [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x, assuming all the complex comes from the dissociation.

Wait,
