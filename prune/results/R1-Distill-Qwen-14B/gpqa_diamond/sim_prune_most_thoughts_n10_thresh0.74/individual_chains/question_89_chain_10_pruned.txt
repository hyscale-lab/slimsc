Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, I need to figure out each step's product. Let's start with the first reaction.

1,3-Dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH (excess) and heat. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very stable. When dibromides react with KOH, elimination is common. But wait, since it's dibromide and KOH, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or a substitution? Wait, but KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's an E2 elimination?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons (since it's 1,3, but in adamantane, the structure is such that those are bridgehead positions). So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is removed, and the molecule forms a double bond. Let me think, elimination would form 1,3-diene? Or maybe a bridge is formed?

Wait, no. Adamantane is a bicyclic structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on bridgehead carbons. When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group. Wait, but KOH is excess and heated. It might lead to a substitution reaction.

Wait, but substitution on bridgehead carbons might be difficult due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe the two bromides undergo elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but the positions are 1 and 3. So the molecule would lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicy
