Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right! That's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. When I think about a qubit state, it's usually represented as a vector in a 2D space, like the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices are 2x2 matrices, right?

So, the density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, this ρ is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal weight (since it's 1/2 times each). That makes it a mixed state. The maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state, which should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere, the origin. Because on the Bloch sphere, the origin (r=0) represents the completely mixed state, whereas the surface points are pure states.

Wait, but how does this relate to the geometrical position in qubit space? I remember the Bloch vector representation. A single qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere, where the components correspond to the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a 3D vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Let me expand ρ. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me write that out in matrix form. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (1/2) I. So ρ = I/2.

Now, according to the Bloch vector form of the density matrix: ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let's compute that. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So plugging in:

ρ = (I + r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]) / 2

But our ρ is I/2. So setting the two expressions equal:

I/2 = [I + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)]/2

Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z

The only way this can be true is if r_x, r_y, and r_z are all zero. Because adding any Pauli matrices would change the matrix. So r must be (0,0,0).

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That's the origin in the 3D space, which makes sense because the maximally mixed state has no preference in any direction, so it's at the center.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin, as it has no preference in any direction. To confirm this, we can express the density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which is only possible if \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is the origin.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
