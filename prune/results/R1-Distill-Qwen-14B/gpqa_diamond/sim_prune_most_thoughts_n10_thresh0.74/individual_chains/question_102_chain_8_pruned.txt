Okay, so I've got this really complicated question here about molecular biology constructs and mouse models. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

Alright, the setup is that there's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells, and they want to study their interaction's developmental role. The question is about why a particular fluorescent signal isn't showing up in the mice.

The first part describes the receptors and ligands. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. Not sure if that structural info is crucial for the answer, but maybe it's just background.

Next, they're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector has both ligand and receptor genes.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate transcript after the ligand, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, in a bicistronic vector, the IRES would allow the second gene to be translated from the same mRNA. So the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the same transcript would code for both, but the IRES would let the ribosome switch to the receptor ORF.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassette would prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise it.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested them on Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which I think means they're loading correctly, so the blot is working. But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, then crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the confocal.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector with both ligand and receptor. But how is the expression controlled? In the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which might drive its expression, and the receptor is after IRES. But the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression. But when Cre is introduced, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recognized and the stop cassettes are removed. So in the
