Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, right. To find the mass dimension of κ, I think I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), each term in it must also be dimensionless.

Wait, no. Wait. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because the action S = ∫ d^4x L is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, L_int must have mass dimension 4. So, let's look at each part of the term κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Break down each component:

ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? That's (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Since the gamma matrices γ_μ are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is also dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} has dimension 0.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. F_{mu nu} has dimensions of [mass]^2 because the electromagnetic field tensor is built from the derivatives of the gauge field A_mu, which has dimension 1. So ∂_mu A_nu has dimension 2 (since derivative is [mass]^1), and F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so same dimension as each term: 2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. A_mu has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂_mu - i e A_mu. The derivative has dimension 1, so A_mu must have dimension 1 to balance it. Then, F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each term is derivative (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together:

The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{mu nu} * ψ * F^{mu nu}.

Each part's dimension:
- κ: unknown, let's call it [κ].
- ψ̄: 3/2.
- σ_{mu nu}: 0.
- ψ: 3/2.
- F^{mu nu}: 2.

Multiply all the dimensions together and set equal to 4 (since L has dimension 4).

So the product's dimension is [κ] * (3/2) * 0? Wait, no. Wait, σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so in the product, it's [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the product is:

κ * ψ̄ * σ_{mu nu} * ψ * F^{mu nu}.

So each term:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ_{mu nu}: 0
ψ: 3/2
F^{mu nu}: 2.

So the product's dimension (including κ) would be [κ] * (3/2) * (0) [Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because sigma
