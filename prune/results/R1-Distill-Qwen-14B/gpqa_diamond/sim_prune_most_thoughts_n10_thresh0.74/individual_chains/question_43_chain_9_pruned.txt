Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for IUPAC naming, the substituents on the benzene ring are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. The principal functional group is the highest priority, which in this case is the carboxylic acid because it has the highest priority. So the carboxylic acid will be at position 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (formyl group), and a cyano group. All of them are meta to each other. Oh, but wait, the description says they are all meta to one another. Hmm, maybe that's not possible with three substituents? Because with three substituents on a benzene ring, they can't all be meta to each other if they're all attached. Unless they're arranged in a way that each is meta to the others. But maybe I should just focus on the numbering as per the substituents' positions.

So the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Now, the other groups are meta to each other, which would be positions 3, 5, and so on. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. Hmm, possibly the positions are 1 (carboxylic acid), 3 (formyl), and 5 (cyano)? Because those are meta to each other.

Wait, but let me visualize the benzene ring. Numbering starts at the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the next substituents: meta to 1 would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, so if the carboxylic acid is at 1, the formyl is at 3, and cyano at 5, then they are all meta to each other. That makes sense because each is two carbons apart from each other.

So positions 1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), 5 (CN). Got it. Now, the rest of the substituents are attached ortho and para to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, the carboxylic acid has substituents ortho (positions 2 and 6), and para (position
