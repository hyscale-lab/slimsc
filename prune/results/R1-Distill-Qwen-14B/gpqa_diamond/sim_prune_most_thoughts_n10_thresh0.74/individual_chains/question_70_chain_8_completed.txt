Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about reaction mechanisms and figuring out the molecular symmetry of a product E. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups are something to do with point groups, right? I remember learning about these in my organic chemistry class. They involve determining the symmetry elements a molecule has, which helps in understanding its structure.

Let's start by going through the reactions given. The problem has a few steps, so maybe I'll break it down.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents... That number seems significant. It makes me think of something like a polymerization reaction, but maybe it's more likely a coordination compound. Wait, 8 equivalents—could that be related to something like octahedral geometry? Because octahedral complexes have six ligands, but wait, no, if it's eight, maybe something else. Or perhaps it's a stoichiometric ratio. Like, maybe A is a metal ion, and B is a ligand. For example, maybe A is a transition metal and B is a chloride or ammonia.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, if C is a compound that reacts with another gas, maybe D is a strong oxidizing agent or something that forms a dangerous compound. Alternatively, maybe D is something like O2 or another diatomic gas.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak one, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is something else like H2SO3 or HNO2 or maybe something like H3PO4. Wait, but H3PO4 is a weak acid but not that strong. Hmm, maybe F is H2SO4, which is strong, and G is HNO2, which is weaker. Or maybe F is HNO3, which is strong, and G is H2S, but that's a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when a salt reacts with water, it can hydrolyze. Suppose C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. That might happen if C is a metal salt of a weak acid. For example, maybe C is a sulfide or something else. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, but that might produce NH3 and something else. Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the reactions. The first reaction is A + 8B → C. The second is C + 2D → E. Then, C + H2O → A + F + G.

Wait, if C is a salt that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts. Or maybe C is a complex that releases two different anions when it reacts with water. Like, for example, if C is a salt of two different weak acids, so when it dissociates in water, it produces both F- and G- ions, which then form the respective acids. Since F is a strong acid, maybe F is HCl, so the anion would be Cl-; but that would come from a chloride salt. Hmm, but if F is a strong acid, then its conjugate base (from C) would be a weak base. Wait, but in the hydrolysis reaction, when C reacts with water, the anions would react with water. So, if C is a salt like MClO4 or something else, but wait, the two acids are different. Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and another salt.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, F and G are acids, so they should be the products of the anions in C reacting with water. So, C is likely a salt that contains two different anions, each of which will form F and G when hydrolyzed.

Wait, but if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, their conjugate bases would be weak and strong, respectively. Because strong acids have weak conjugate bases. So, for F being a strong acid, its conjugate base would be weak, meaning the anion would not react much in water. But wait, in hydrolysis, the anion would react with water. So, if the anion is from a strong acid, its conjugate base is weak, so the anion would not hydrolyze much. Hmm, but in the problem, the hydrolysis produces two different acids, so perhaps the anions are of weak acids, so when they hydrolyze, they release the weak acid and maybe something else.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something else. If B is a gas, like CO or NH3, and D is another gas like O2 or something else, but in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps H is something like H2O (but that would require B and D reacting in a 2:1 ratio, like O2 and H2). Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about possible candidates for each compound.

Let me make some assumptions. Let's say that in the first reaction, A is a metal, maybe Fe, and B is a ligand like NH3. 8 equivalents of NH3 reacting with Fe to form a coordination compound. Iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate maybe? But wait, that doesn’t fit 8 equivalents. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal ion, say Fe^2+ and B is CN- or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal, and B is a halide. For example, if A is Fe^3+ and B is Cl-, then 8 Cl- would form something like FeCl6^3-? But then C would be FeCl6^3- but that's in solution. But the product is a bright red solid, so maybe it's a complex like Fe(OH)3? No, that's reddish-brown. Alternatively, maybe it's a hexaaqua ion, but those are usually more on the green or yellow side. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The bright red product C. I'm trying to think of red compounds. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but more of a rust color. Maybe something like CoCl2 is blue, but when hydrated, it's pink. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound. Hmm, but nitro compounds are often brown or yellow. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, but most sulfides aren't red. Oh, wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product C is a coordination compound with a certain color. For example, [Fe(SCN)]^n+ complexes can be red. Oh! The Prussian blue reaction involves Fe and SCN. Wait, but Prussian blue is blue, not red. Alternatively, maybe C is a different type of complex with a red color. Alternatively, maybe it's a different metal, like cobalt. For example, [Co(NH3)6]^3+ is blue.

Wait, maybe I should think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E. E is extremely hazardous. So, if E is a dangerous gas, perhaps like chlorine gas, or maybe something like phosgene, but more likely a common dangerous gas. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic compound like sarin or something, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound, like ozone or something else.

Wait, but perhaps E is a gas as well. If C is a metal compound and D is a halogen, like Cl2, then maybe E is something like a metal chloride. But why would that be extremely hazardous? Alternatively, if E is a toxic gas like HCN, but I don't think that's formed from Cl2 and another gas.

Wait, let's rethink. The fourth reaction is D + B → H, a solvent. So, B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. If H is a common solvent, perhaps H is H2O, but then B and D would need to be H2 and O2, which react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. That doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is something like NH3. But then B + D would produce NH3. Hmm, like if B is H2 and D is N2, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe H is an alcohol, but that would require B and D to be something like O2 and H2, which would make H2O again.

Wait, perhaps B is CO and D is H2O. Then, CO + H2O would form something? No, that's not a 1:1 reaction. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2, which would form HCl, but that's a 1:1 reaction. HCl is a gas, but it's a strong acid. So, if H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from B and D?

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to find which product E is, because that's what the question is about. The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. So, perhaps E has a well-known structure with a specific point group.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, D2v. Let me think about these. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with a four-fold rotation and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h is a group with an infinite-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors, which is common for linear molecules like CO2 or H2O (but H2O isn't linear). Wait, no, H2O is bent. CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is a linear molecule like CO2 or O2, it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, D4h would be for something like a square planar molecule, but more likely for something like SO2, which is bent. Wait, but SO2 has a V shape, which is C2v symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: E could be O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure with a certain symmetry. Ozone has a central oxygen atom with two others attached, and the molecule is bent. Ozone has a point group of D2h? Or maybe C2v. Let me think. Ozone has a structure where the central O is bonded to two O atoms with a bent geometry, and it has a C2v symmetry because there's a mirror plane through the central O and the midpoint of the O-O bond, plus a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to that. So its point group is C2v. So if E is O3, then the symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

But wait, how would E be formed? Let's think. So C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. If C is something like Ozone's precursor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: What if E is SO2? SO2 is a bent molecule with a planar structure, and its point group is D2h or C2v? Let me recall: SO2 has a bent structure, similar to O3. It has a central S atom with two double bonds to O and a lone pair. The symmetry would include a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecule, and two mirror planes. So, the point group would be D2h. Wait, but D2h has more elements of symmetry than C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So what would cause E to be CO2? Let's see.

If D is O2, but that's a gas. Let's think about the reactions again.

Let me try to outline the possible reactions:

1. A + 8B → C (bright red)
2. C + 2D → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F + G
4. B + D → H (solvent)

Assuming H is a solvent, maybe H is H2O, but how? If B and D combine to form H2O, like B is H2 and D is O2. Then, H would be H2O. But that would require B and D to be H2 and O2, but the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio, but the problem states it's a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe B is CH4 and D is H2O, but I don't see how that would form a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if H is an alcohol, like ethanol. Then, B and D would have to form ethanol. But that would require B and D to be something like CO2 and H2, but I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3. Then, B and D would have to combine to form NH3. For example, if B is H2 and D is N2, but that's not a straightforward reaction, and the ratio isn't 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each reaction again.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

If F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (weak), then A would be something like S (though that's not likely). Or maybe F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is HNO2 (weak). Then, A could be a metal oxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. When nitrides react with water, they produce NH3 and a strong base, but that doesn't fit because F and G are acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3, then when it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids, not a base. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce much, unless it's in acid. Wait, but the reaction is just with water. So maybe C is a sulfite or carbonate and upon hydrolysis produces the respective acid and a base, but that would require a base and an acid. But in the problem, both F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe if C is a salt that releases two different weak acids. For example, if C is a salt of two different weak acids, like sodium bicarbonate (but that's a base). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride and another salt. Like, if C is a mixture of two chlorides, but that doesn't directly lead to two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaCl and another salt, but that seems off.

Wait, another angle: when a salt like NaHSO4 reacts with water, it can dissociate into H+ (from HSO4^-) and Na+. But that doesn’t produce two different acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of C produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a polyatomic anion that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is a phosphate salt, like CaHPO4, which upon hydrolysis can produce H3PO4 and H2PO4^-? But that's a single acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonyl. For example, if C is Fe(CO)5, but that's a liquid, not a solid.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to think about possible structures for E.

If E has a symmetry group of D∞h, it's likely a linear molecule. What about CO2? CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, then the answer would be D∞h (option C).

But how would E be formed? Let's see. C reacts with 2 D to form E. If E is CO2, perhaps C is something that upon reaction with O2 (D being O2) would form CO2. But that would require C to be carbon. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, if C is carbon monoxide (CO), and D is O2, then 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. That's a plausible reaction. So, if C is CO, D is O2, then E is CO2.

But wait, in the first reaction, A + 8B → C (CO). So, what would A and B be?

A is a solid, B is a gas. If C is CO, which is a gas, but the product is bright red solid. Wait, that doesn't fit. CO is a gas, but the product C is described as a bright red solid. So perhaps C isn't CO.

Hmm, maybe E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry (option D). Ozone is a bent molecule, and its point group is C2v.

If E is O3, how is it formed? C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form O3. So perhaps C is O2, and D is something else. Wait, but O2 is a diatomic gas; if C is O2, then reacting with D to form O3 would require the reaction O2 + D → O3. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: if C is a peroxide, maybe it decomposes upon reaction with D. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3 (chlorine trifluoride), which is a highly reactive and hazardous compound. ClF3 is a tetrahedral molecule, I think, but its point group might be Td or something else. Not sure if it's one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl, which is a gas. But HCl has a linear structure, so D∞h symmetry. But HCl is a diatomic molecule, so yes, it has D∞h symmetry. Then, if E is HCl, how is it formed?

If E is HCl, then C + 2 D → 2 HCl. So, C could be a chloride salt, and D could be H2. For example, if C is MgCl2, and D is H2, then MgCl2 + H2 → Mg + 2 HCl. But that would require more H2, perhaps. But then, where does the 2 equivalents fit in?

Alternatively, if C is CaCl2 and D is H2, then CaCl2 + H2 → Ca + 2 HCl. But again, I'm not sure if the stoichiometry would fit.

But this is getting too speculative. Maybe I should try to think about other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: The problem is about molecular symmetry, so E's structure must be such that it fits one of the given options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is O3, then the symmetry is C2v (option D). If E is CO2, D∞h (option C). If E is H2O, which is bent, but H2O has C2v symmetry as well. But D∞h is for linear molecules.

So, considering that, if E is a linear molecule, the symmetry group would be D∞h. But which reaction would produce a linear molecule like CO2 or O3.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say A is carbon, B is something else. But I'm not following that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2. O2 is diatomic, has D∞h symmetry. But O2 is a gas, and the problem states that E is extremely hazardous. But O2 isn't that hazardous. Alternatively, maybe E is a different diatomic molecule, like Cl2, which is greenish-yellow gas and quite dangerous. Cl2 is diatomic, so D∞h symmetry. Then, if E is Cl2, its symmetry is D∞h (option C).

But how would E be formed? C + 2 D → Cl2.

If D is Cl2, but then B and D would have to be something else. Wait, no, let's think.

If D is Cl2, and in the reaction C + 2 D → E, then E would be something else. Wait, perhaps E is Cl2 itself? No, because it's a product, and D is a reactant.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a product of a decomposition reaction. C could be a chlorate or something that decomposes upon heating to release Cl2 and other products.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O2, but that has C2v symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C2: a two-fold rotation axis. Could be for a molecule like H2O (but H2O is C2v), or perhaps a molecule like NH3 (but NH3 has C3v symmetry). Alternatively, maybe a molecule like I2 (which is diatomic, so D∞h).

B) D4h: a dihedral group with four-fold rotation and horizontal mirrors. Examples include SO2, which is V-shaped, and has D2h symmetry. Wait, SO2 has a central S with two double bonds to O, and a bent structure with a plane of symmetry. Its point group is D2h.

Wait, no, I think SO2 is D2h. Alternatively, maybe something like O2 has D∞h.

C) D∞h: linear molecules like CO2, O2, HCN.

D) C2v: bent molecules like H2O, NH3, O3.

So, if E is O3, it's C2v. If E is CO2, it's D∞h. If E is O2, D∞h.

But I need to figure out which E is based on the reactions.

Let me try making some assumptions.

Assume that C is a metal complex, like [Fe(SCN)]^n+ which is red. Then, when C reacts with D (maybe O2), it forms E, perhaps FeO or something, which is hazardous. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, which when reacted with D (like O2) forms SO2 or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the hydrolysis of C. C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid, say H2SO4, and G is a weak acid like HNO2, then the anions in C would be SO4^2- and NO2^-.

So, C would be a salt containing both SO4^2- and NO2^- ions. Wait, but that's unusual. Maybe C is a mixed salt, but that's not common.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite, which when hydrolyzed gives H2SO3 (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But then F would be H2SO3 (weak), which contradicts the problem because F is a strong acid.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the possible structures of E and which option fits.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). If it's bent, then C2v (option D). If it has a four-fold axis, D4h (option B). And if it's only a two-fold axis, C2 (option A).

The question is, which E is formed under the given conditions.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN. HCN is linear, so D∞h symmetry. How would that form?

If C is a cyanide salt, and D is H2O or something else. Then, perhaps C reacts with H2O to produce HCN and another acid.

But looking back, in the third reaction, C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So, if C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, reacting with water would produce HCN (F) and NaOH (which would be A, but NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, but the problem says F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.)

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. Reacting with water doesn't do much, unless it's in an acidic solution. But the problem states that it reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So maybe if C is a carbonate, and F is CO2 (a weak acid?), but that's not right.

Another thought: If F is a strong acid, perhaps it's H2SO4, and G is HNO3 as another acid. Wait, but both are strong acids. Hmm, no, the problem states F is strong, G is weak.

Wait, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak). So C would be a salt containing Cl^- and S^2- ions. But S^2- is a strong base and would react with water to form HS^- and OH^-, but I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide salt, like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't do much, but if it's in acid, it produces H2S. But the problem states that C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So maybe it's a more reactive salt.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. For example, sodium nitride (Na3N) reacts with water to produce NH3 and NaOH. But again, F and G are acids, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let's think about the possible E again.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, which have D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.

But how do the reactions fit?

Assume that in the first reaction, A is carbon, B is something else. Wait, but A is a solid. Carbon is a solid. B is a gas. So, maybe C is carbon monoxide, but CO is a gas, and the product C is described as a bright red solid. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, A could be a metal, say iron. B is NH3, a gas. 8 equivalents of NH3 reacting with Fe could form Fe(NH3)_something. Iron hexacyanidoferrate is a possible compound, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, if Fe reacts with excess NH3, it forms [Fe(NH3)6]^3+ which is a pale yellow-brown precipitate. Not red. Alternatively, if it's a different metal, like cobalt. Cobalt with NH3 might form a blue complex, but not red.

Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is the formation of a metal sulfide. For example, FeS is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: could C be a transition metal nitrosyl complex? Like [Fe(NO)(CN)_5]^4- or something. I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe a different chromium complex is red.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a manganese compound. Some manganese compounds are pink or red.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Perhaps I need to think of E as a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, which would make the answer C.

But without knowing E's exact structure, I'm not entirely sure. I think the key clue is the extremely hazardous product. Ozone is dangerous but not the most common. Cl2 is very hazardous. CO is toxic, but it's a gas. HCN is highly toxic and is a linear molecule.

Wait, HCN is linear, so its symmetry group is D∞h. So if E is HCN, it would fit option C.

How would E be formed? C + 2 D → HCN.

If C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, and D is H2O, then reaction might be NaCN + H2O → NaOH + HCN. But that's a 1:1 reaction, but the problem says 2 equivalents of D. Hmm, perhaps D is something else.

Alternatively, if C is a nitrile, like CH3CN (which is a liquid, not a solid), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: If E is HCN, which is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group is D∞h, which is option C.

But how does that tie into the other reactions?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different linear molecule. I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe E is a diatomic molecule like O2, which has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is O2, which is a gas, then how is it formed?

C could be some oxide that upon reaction with D (like another oxide) forms O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2, which has a bent structure and point group D2h. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So, if E is a molecule with a four-fold axis, like SO2, but its point group is D2h, which is not an option. So that's out.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with C2v symmetry, that would be option D. Ozone fits here.

So, perhaps E is O3.

How would that happen? C could be O2, and D could be something else, but I'm not sure how O2 would react with another gas to form O3. Maybe via some photochemical reaction, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, like H2O2, which is a liquid, but the problem states C is a bright red solid. Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given the options and the fact that E is extremely hazardous, I'm leaning towards E being a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, which would make the answer option C. So, CO2 or O2 or HCN.

Wait, but earlier I thought HCN could be a possibility. If HCN is E, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is bent, the symmetry group is C2v (option D).

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Ozone is dangerous, but so is HCN.

I'm not sure, but given the options and the possible structures, I think E is likely to be a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, so the answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry (8 equivalents) suggests a coordination complex, possibly involving a transition metal and ligands. The bright red color hints at a specific compound, but the exact identity of C remains unclear.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This reaction suggests that E is a gas or highly reactive compound. Possible candidates for E include toxic or reactive molecules like CO2, Cl2, HCN, or O3.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C likely contains anions that hydrolyze to form these acids. For example, if F is HCl (strong acid) and G is H2S (weak acid), C might be a salt containing Cl⁻ and S²⁻ ions.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This provides a clue about the identity of D and B, but the exact nature of H is not explicitly determined.

### Analysis of Molecular Symmetry Groups:
- **Option A (C2)**: This group involves a two-fold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O (bent) or NH3 (trigonal pyramidal) belong to this group, but these do not match the description of E as extremely hazardous.
- **Option B (D4h)**: This group involves a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Molecules like SO2 (bent) or square planar molecules might fit, but these are not highly hazardous or consistent with the reactions.
- **Option C (D∞h)**: This group applies to linear molecules like CO2, Cl2, or HCN. These are all linear and highly hazardous, making them strong candidates for E.
- **Option D (C2v)**: This group applies to bent molecules like O3 (ozone) or H2O. Ozone is a bent, highly hazardous molecule, but it does not fit the linear symmetry implied by the reactions.

### Conclusion:
Given the reactions and the description of E as extremely hazardous, the most plausible candidate for E is a linear molecule. Among the options, HCN (linear, highly toxic) or CO2 (linear, inert but fitting the symmetry) aligns with the symmetry group D∞h. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
