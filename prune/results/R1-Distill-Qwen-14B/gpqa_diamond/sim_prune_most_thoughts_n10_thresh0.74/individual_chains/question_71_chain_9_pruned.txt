Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a certain ratio. But wait, how does that tie into their temperatures?

The question says the periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Each planet is designated Planet_1 to Planet_5. They all have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect. But since it's the same, it won't factor into the ratio, I think.

The equilibrium temperature formula, if I recall correctly, is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, another version I've heard is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but that might be more detailed. Alternatively, I think when considering planets around the same star, the formula simplifies because L and other factors are constant.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by a planet is proportional to L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity and a is the distance. The equilibrium temperature is when the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. Since albedo is the same, the absorbed fraction is the same for all, so the temperature should be proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but since all planets are around the same star, L and other constants are the same. So the temperature should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, because a is proportional to the orbital period when we consider Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, right? So P² ∝ a³. That means a = (P²)^(1/3) * some constant. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

But the equilibrium temperature formula is T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) because the flux goes like 1/a². Wait, no, let's get the exact formula correct. The equilibrium temperature is given by
