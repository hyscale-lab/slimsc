Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about particles colliding in a detector and their Lorentz factor. I remember that Lorentz factor is gamma, which comes into play with relativity, especially when dealing with particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds.

So the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying, and they travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so initially, with gamma around 20, only 1/3 reach the walls. Now we want 2/3 to reach. What changes? I think the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles and how it relates to the distance they need to travel. Because if the particles decay before reaching the detector's wall, they won't be detected.

Right, the lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame sees the particle's lifetime as longer due to time dilation.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the detector's wall is the distance divided by the particle's speed. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we can approximate the speed as the speed of light, c. So the time t is approximately R/c, where R is 30 meters.

But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, the time experienced by the particle (proper time) is tau = t / gamma. Hmm, no, wait. The proper time is the time in the particle's frame, which is shorter. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

The particles must live long enough to reach the detector's wall. So the condition is that gamma * tau >= t. Because if their lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, they'll make it. Otherwise, they'll decay before.

Wait, but initially, only 1/3 reach the wall. So gamma is 20, and the number that decay before reaching the wall is 2/3, and those that reach are 1/3. Hmm, maybe it's about the fraction that decay versus the fraction that survive.

Wait, the particles decay exponentially. The probability of a particle decaying before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the number that reach the wall is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, when gamma is 20, the fraction that reach the wall is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

Wait, yes. So for the initial condition, 1/3 = exp(- t/(gamma tau)).

We can compute t as R/(beta c). Oh wait, because if the speed is v, then t = R/(v). But for ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so beta is approximately 1. So beta ≈ 1, so t ≈
