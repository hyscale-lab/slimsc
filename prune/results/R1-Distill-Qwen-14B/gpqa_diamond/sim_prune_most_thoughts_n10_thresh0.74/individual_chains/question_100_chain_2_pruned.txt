Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

So, first, the starting compound is A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is propene because the formula is like C3H6, which has a double bond. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Now, compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, bromination of alkenes usually leads to dibromination, but wait, when it's with CCl4, that's probably an addition reaction. So the double bond in propene would react with Br2. Since propene has a terminal double bond, the addition of Br2 would probably be anti addition, adding a Br to each carbon of the double bond.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Alkenes react with bromine (Br2) in a diaddition. So CH2=CH2 would become CH2BrCH2Br, but that's for ethylene. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane? Or is it 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, the addition is across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to become CH2BrCHBrCH3, right? So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and would probably lead to an elimination reaction. Since compound B is a vicinal dibromide (two Brs on adjacent carbons), when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr and form an alkene. So the double bond would reform, but where? Let me think, the starting compound is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When you eliminate, you lose H from one Br and Br from the adjacent. So for example, removing a Br from the first carbon and H from the second, or vice versa.

Wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH removes H from the middle CHBr and Br from the adjacent CH2Br, that would form a double bond between C1 and C2. So that would give back propene, but wait, the starting material was propene, so after bromination and then elimination, we get the same alkene? But
