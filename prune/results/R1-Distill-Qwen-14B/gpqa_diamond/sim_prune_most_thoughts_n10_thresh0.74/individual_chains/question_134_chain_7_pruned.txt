Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and molarities are given for each. Hmm, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Right, so I think the first thing to do is figure out how much acid and base we're dealing with and see if they neutralize each other completely.

Wait, but wait a minute, there are three solutions here. Two acids and one base? Or is one of them a base and the other two acids? Let me look again: HCl is an acid, H2SO4 is an acid (because it's a strong acid), and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So, perhaps the HCl and H2SO4 are reacting with Ba(OH)2. But I need to think about stoichiometry here.

So, the first step is to calculate the moles of HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2.

Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Let me compute each:

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So, the available H+ from H2SO4 is 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: It's a strong base as well. The formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles, but wait wait, no, wait. Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M, and volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. So moles = 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, let's think about the neutralization reactions. Neutralization is between acids and bases. So the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

Total H+ from the acids: HCl contributes 0.1 moles of H+ (since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely). H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+ as it's diprotic.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

So now, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The limiting reagent here is OH- because we have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-. So OH- will run out first, and H+ will have 0.08 moles left. Wait, no, because in neutralization, H+ and OH- react 1:1.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28.

Moles of OH- available: 0.2.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. All OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So, the OH- is 0.2 moles. When it reacts, it neutralizes 0.2 moles of H+. So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate, so the OH- is 0.2 moles. The H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.28. So, when they mix, the H+ and OH- will combine, and the excess H+ will remain.

So, the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles. But wait, in the solution, the excess H+ will make the solution acidic.

But for enthalpy of neutralization, I think we only consider the reaction that occurs, which is the neutralization part. So the heat released is from the 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. For strong acids and bases, it's
