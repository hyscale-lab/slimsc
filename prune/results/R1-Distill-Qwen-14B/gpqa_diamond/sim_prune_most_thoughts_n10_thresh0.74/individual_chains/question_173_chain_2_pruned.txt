Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electrons and uncertainty in their energy. Oh right, this must be related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that Heisenberg said we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more we know about one, the less we know about the other.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. Wait, 0.1 nanometers is the same as 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10.

The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh, I think the Uncertainty Principle relates Δx and Δp (momentum uncertainty). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I guess we'll use the equality, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

First, I need to find Δp. Because once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. Oh wait, energy is related to momentum. For an electron, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. But wait, since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe ΔE is related to Δp in the same way. So ΔE would be approximately (Δp²)/(2m), right? Or maybe using the relation between kinetic energy and momentum, since for non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m).

Wait, but the speed given is v = 2e8 m/s. Let me think: the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so this speed is about 2/3 of the speed of light. Hmm, so it's not exactly non-relativistic. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can treat it as non-relativistic because the options are in the order of 1e-16 to 1e-18 J, which suggests that approximations are okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in energy is calculated using the uncertainty in momentum. Since the momentum is related to the kinetic energy, the uncertainty in energy would be the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m). So that's the approach I'll take.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate Δp using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)
2. Then compute ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m)
3. Plug in the numbers.

Let me jot down the constants. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. The mass of the electron, m, is about 9.10938356e-31 kg.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check these values. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1
