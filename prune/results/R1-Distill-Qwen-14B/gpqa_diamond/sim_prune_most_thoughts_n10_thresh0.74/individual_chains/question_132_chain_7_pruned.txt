Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that we have a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, let me get the key points straight. The molecular formula is C10H14. For benzene derivatives, the general formula is CnH2n-6. So for a benzene ring (C6H6), if we have four substituents, each is a methyl group (each adds a CH3), so the formula would be C10H14. Because each methyl adds one carbon and three hydrogens. So 6 carbons from benzene, plus four methyl groups (4 carbons) makes 10. Hydrogens: benzene has 6, each methyl adds 3, so 4*3=12, but wait, benzene's formula is C6H6. So when we add four methyl groups, each CH3, the formula becomes C6+4=10 carbons, and H is 6 + (4*3) =18. But wait, does that match the molecular formula here? No, because the given formula is C10H14. Hmm, wait, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So adding four methyl groups: 4*(CH3) adds 4*3=12 H. So original H6 +12 =18. But the formula given is C10H14. That's only 14 H. So wait, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents isn't a methyl. Wait, wait, but all options are tetramethyl, except one which is diethyl.

Wait, wait. Let me check. The options are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene. So diethyl is two ethyl groups. So the diethylbenzene would have two ethyl substituents on the benzene ring. So for that, each ethyl is CH2CH3, so adding two ethyl groups: each has 2 carbons, so total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2*(2) = 6+4=10. So C10H14? Let's see: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group has 5 H (since CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H). Two ethyl groups add 10 H, so total 6+10=16 H. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps each ethyl group is CH2CH3, so each has two CH2 groups. Wait no, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which is two carbons and three hydrogens on the second carbon. So each ethyl group has 2+3=5 H. So two ethyl groups would add 10 H to the benzene ring, which originally has 6 H. So total H would be 6 + 10 = 16. But the molecular formula is C10H14. So that's 16 H, but the formula has 14. That doesn't add up. Hmm, that's a problem. Or maybe the other substituents are different.

Wait, wait, perhaps the diethyl benzene is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Then, the structure would have two ethyl substituents on the ring. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl brings 2 carbons and 5 hydrogens. Two ethyls: 4 C, 10 H. So total C6+4=10, H6 +10=16. But the molecular formula in the problem is C10H14. So that's not matching. So that can't be correct. Hmm, but the option C is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. So something's off here. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps the diethylbenzene isn't a substituent. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but I have to proceed with the given information.

Wait, perhaps the diethylbenzene is not part of the solution. Let me get back to the NMR data.

The aromatic signals are two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, each contributing their own signals, but sometimes they might overlap. Alternatively, maybe each compound has two sets of aromatic protons, but in this case, their signals are overlapping or are each a singlet, so two singlets in total.

Wait, but in the mixture, each compound contributes their own signals. So if each compound has a singlet, then the mixture would have two singlets. Which matches the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has equivalent aromatic protons, so each appears as a singlet. So let's think about the structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. So both are tetramethyl, each with four methyl groups attached.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4. So each is a tetramethylbenzene.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethyl.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

So I need to figure out which structures would have aromatic protons that are either absent (all positions substituted) or have equivalent protons that would appear as singlets.

Wait, in a benzene ring with multiple substituents, the aromatic protons can be in equivalent positions leading to singlets.

Let me think about each option.

First, for tetramethylbenzenes. Let's consider 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That would have four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So the ring would look like:

Positions 1,2,3,4 are substituted with methyl. So positions 5 and 6 are hydrogen. Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions are adjacent. So if substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituted positions. Wait, perhaps that leads to equivalent protons.

Wait, no. Let me draw the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at 1, 2, 3,
