Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So substituting the values: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. X is zero here. So the formula is (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2=9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I messed up the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: 2*9=18 +2=20. Minus H (11) is 9. Minus X (0), plus N (1) is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings and double bonds. Probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one more double bond, maybe a carbonyl.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Since the compound has an amino group, that makes sense. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an amide or ester or something like that.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, ethyl maybe.
4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, two protons. Could be adjacent to an oxygen or maybe part of an OCH2 group, but the broadness might suggest it's near a carbonyl or something else.
4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H suggests maybe a CH2 next to another CH2, like ethyl ester or something. For example, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a quartet. Wait, but the quartet in ethyl ester is usually around 4.1-4.3, but here it's at 4.5. Hmm, maybe it's a different group.
7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – these are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are typical for aromatic protons. The downfield shift at 8.0 could be due to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or an amino group (but amino groups are usually de-shielding but in a different way). Wait, but if there's a carbonyl
