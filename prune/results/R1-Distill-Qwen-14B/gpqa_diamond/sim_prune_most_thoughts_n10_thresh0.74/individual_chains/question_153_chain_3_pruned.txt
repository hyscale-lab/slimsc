Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to find out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Let me start with part A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

In the Michael reaction, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no, wait: the formula is CH2CH2C(O)OCH3 but with E configuration. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: so it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the CH2? Or maybe it's CH2-C(=O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the adjacent carbon. Let me get that right.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, because acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl? Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(OCH2Ph)COOCH3? No, perhaps I'm
