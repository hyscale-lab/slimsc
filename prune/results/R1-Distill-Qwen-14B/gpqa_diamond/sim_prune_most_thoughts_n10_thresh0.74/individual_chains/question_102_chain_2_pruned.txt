Alright, let's try to work through this problem. Okay, so the question is about a genetic construct and why the eGFP isn't showing up under the microscope. Hmm. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

So, the setup is that there's a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're trying to study their developmental fate. The researcher made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is under the control of an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the receptor even if the first gene is expressed. Wait, no, IRES usually allows the second gene to be expressed without the need for a separate promoter, but in this case, the ligand has a CBA promoter, and the receptor is after the IRES. So, maybe the ligand and receptor are both expressed from the same transcript but in a way that allows separate translation? Or is the IRES for the receptor?

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are on the same vector. The ligand is at the 5' end, with the ORF under CBA. Then comes the IRES, and then the receptor's ORF, which is fused to eGFP. Wait, no, the question says that between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop cassette with loxP, and between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. So the ligand is fused to mCherry but with a stop in between, and the receptor is fused to eGFP with another stop. So, I think this is a way to have two separate expression units but under a single promoter. Or perhaps the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed as a separate mRNA? I might be getting confused here.

Wait, the vector is a bic
