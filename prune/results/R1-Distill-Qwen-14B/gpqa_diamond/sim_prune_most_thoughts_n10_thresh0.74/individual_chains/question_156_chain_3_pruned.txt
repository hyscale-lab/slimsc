Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The options are about how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an addition reaction where the alkene reacts with the peracid to form an epoxide. Oh wait, and the reaction is stereospecific. For each alkene configuration, the epoxide can form in a specific way.

Wait, but when you have an alkene, say (E)-oct-4-ene, reacting with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But how does the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affect the epoxide? I think that for trans (E) alkenes, the epoxide forms with the two new oxygen atoms adding on the same side, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, no. Maybe I should think about the mechanism.

Epoxidation via mCPBA is a concerted process, right? The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms add with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, for a trans double bond (E), the substituents on each carbon are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms add on the same face.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The peracid approaches the double bond. The two carbons of the double bond each form a new bond with an oxygen from the peracid. The configuration of the alkene affects the configuration of the resulting epoxide.

If the starting alkene is (E), the substituents on each carbon are opposite. When the peracid adds, the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on the same side relative to each other. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me draw a little.

Take (E)-oct-4-ene: the structure is CH2CH2
