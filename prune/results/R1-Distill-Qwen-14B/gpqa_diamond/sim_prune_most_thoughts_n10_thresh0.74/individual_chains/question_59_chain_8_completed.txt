Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says we have a mixture of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution after they're all mixed together.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But since there are three solutions here, I should first figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Then, see if there's an excess of either, which will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely as well. So I should account for all the H+ and OH- ions, but I have to be careful with the weak acid.

Let me plan out the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each component in each solution.
2. For each solution, find out how much H+ or OH- it contributes.
3. Add up all the H+ and OH- moles, considering the neutralization between them.
4. Determine the excess of either H+ or OH- after neutralization.
5. Calculate the pH based on the excess.

So, first, let's find the moles of each substance.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid), the volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L, and concentration is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. So the H+ from acetic acid won't be as straightforward. I'll have to handle that after considering the strong acids and bases.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully donate H+. The volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.08 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, concentration 0.3 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So OH- moles = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total volume of the mixture is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

Wait, but before that, I should consider the acid-base neutralization between H+ and OH-.

The strong acid (HCl) provides H+ ions, and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) provides OH- ions. They will neutralize each other: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Similarly, the weak acid (CH3COOH) will contribute some H+ which can also react with any remaining OH-.

So let's calculate the initial H+ and OH- from strong acid and base.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So the H+ and OH- will react. The amount that reacts is the minimum of the two.

H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So all 0.08 H+ will react with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

So after neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2, there's 0.10 moles of OH- left.

Wait, but wait! Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it's donating H+ and Ba(OH)2 is giving OH-. So the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. So:

Total H+ from strong acid: 0.08 mol.
Total OH- from strong base: 0.18 mol.

H+ and OH- will react 1:1. So they'll neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio.

So, 0.08 mol H+ will neutralize 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- remaining.

But wait, what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will contribute additional H+ ions. These can react with the remaining OH-.

So, the acetic acid: 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it won't fully dissociate. But in the presence of excess OH-, which is a strong base, the acetic acid will react with the OH-.

Wait, no. The OH- is a base; it can neutralize the H+ from the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with any H+ available.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.10 mol. Let's see how much H+ the acetic acid can contribute.

But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid. In pure water, it would dissociate a little, but when in the presence of a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate it. Wait, or will the OH- just react with any H+ available?

Hmm, perhaps I should model it as:

The OH- will react with the H+ from all sources. The acetic acid can donate some H+ which will react with the OH-.

But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't have a lot of H+ in solution. But in this case, since we have excess OH-, the acetic acid's H+ will be neutralized.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The overall picture: after the HCl and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, we have 0.10 mol OH- left. Now, this OH- can react with any H+ from the acetic acid.

But acetic acid is CH3COOH, which doesn't dissociate completely. So the [H+] from acetic acid is less than 0.05 mol (since it's a weak acid). But since we have excess OH- (0.10 mol), which is a strong base, the acetic acid will dissociate more because the OH- will pull H+ ions from it.

Wait, but in solution, the OH- will react with any H+ present, regardless of source. So the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the OH- is in solution. It will react with the acetic acid. The reaction would be:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So each mole of OH- consumes one mole of CH3COOH, producing one mole of acetate and one mole of H2O.

So the moles of OH- is 0.10 mol, and moles of acetic acid is 0.05 mol.

So the OH- can react with 0.05 mol of acetic acid, consuming all of the OH- and all of the acetic acid.

Wait, no. Because 0.10 mol OH- is more than the 0.05 mol of acetic acid. So after reacting 0.05 mol OH- with 0.05 mol acetic acid, we have 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- left.

Wait, that's possible. So after the OH- reacts with acetic acid, we're left with 0.05 mol OH-.

So now, the solution has excess OH- ions. So the solution is basic, and the pH will be determined by the concentration of OH-.

So let's trace this again:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

2. Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH-:
   H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.08), leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. The acetic acid (0.05 mol) can react with the remaining OH- (0.10 mol). The reaction is:
   OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

   So, 0.05 mol of OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So now, the total moles of OH- in the solution is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait. Let's check if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- can also react with the H+ ions from the acetic acid's dissociation. But since the acetic acid is a weak acid, it doesn't release many H+ ions. However, since the OH- is a strong base, it will deprotonate the acetic acid.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase:

After the initial reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2, we have 0.10 mol OH- left.

Then, this OH- can react with the acetic acid. The acetic acid can donate protons, but in the presence of OH-, it's more likely that the OH- will pull H+ from the acetic acid, causing it to dissociate.

So, the OH- (0.10 mol) will react with the acetic acid (0.05 mol), which can donate 0.05 mol H+.

So, the OH- is in excess by 0.05 mol.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The OH- (0.10 mol) will react with the acetic acid (0.05 mol). Each mole of acetic acid can donate one mole of H+. So the OH- will consume all 0.05 mol acetic acid, producing 0.05 mol acetate ions and 0.05 mol H2O. Since the OH- was 0.10 mol, after reacting with 0.05 mol acetic acid, we have 0.05 mol OH- remaining.

So, the final moles of OH- is 0.05.

But wait, that's not considering the fact that the acetic acid is a weak acid and may not fully donate H+. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetic acid will donate all its H+ to the OH- because the OH- is a strong base and will deprotonate it completely.

Wait, but the strength of the acid and base matters. Strong bases can deprotonate weak acids. So in this case, the OH- (from a strong base) will react with the acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So yes, the OH- will deprotonate all the acetic acid it can.

So, since we have 0.05 mol acetic acid and 0.10 mol OH-, the acetic acid will donate all its H+ (0.05 mol) to the OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the total moles of OH- in solution is 0.05 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ ?

Wait, let me calculate:

0.0416667 is 1/24. So log(1/24) = log(24)^-1 = - log(24).

But 24 is 2.4e1. So log(24) is log(2.4) +1 ≈ 0.3802 +1 = 1.3802.

So log(1/24) = -1.3802.

So pOH = 1.3802.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 -1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

So about 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for everything correctly?

Let me double-check the steps.

1. HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

2. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.09 mol *2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

3. H+ and OH- neutralize: 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

4. Then, 0.05 mol acetic acid reacts with 0.05 mol OH- (since each OH- takes one H+ from acetic acid), leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So yes, 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

But wait, another thing: acetic acid is a weak acid, but when it reacts with OH-, it's acting as a base. So in this case, the OH- is acting as an acid, right? Wait, no. OH- is a base; it's taking H+ from the acetic acid (which is acting as an acid here).

So the reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the moles of OH- after reacting with acetic acid is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Thus, the concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH is log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38, so pH is 14 -1.38 = 12.62.

So the answer would be option A) 12.62.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about the acetate ions produced? Do they affect the solution's pH?

Hmm. Because when CH3COOH reacts with OH-, it forms CH3COO^- (acetate). Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid). In solution, it can hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

Which would produce OH-, making the solution more basic.

But wait, I already considered the OH- from the base and the reaction with the acid. But if the acetate ion then produces more OH-, will that change the calculation?

Wait, but in this case, after the neutralization, the OH- concentration was calculated as 0.05 mol, which includes any from the acetate hydrolysis. Or does it?

Wait, no. Because when the OH- from Ba(OH)2 reacts with the acetic acid, it's a neutralization reaction, producing acetate. But in my earlier steps, I stopped at the point where the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol. But wait, if the solution now has acetate ions, which can hydrolyze to produce OH-, that would increase the OH- concentration beyond 0.05 mol.

Wait, so perhaps I missed that in my initial calculation.

This complicates things because the acetate ions can contribute to the OH- concentration.

So, maybe I should consider the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Hmm. Let me think again.

After all reactions, the solution contains:

- Some acetate ions (from the reaction between OH- and acetic acid).

- Excess OH-.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me clarify:

The reaction between OH- and acetic acid produces acetate ions and water.

So, the moles of acetate would be 0.05 mol (since 0.05 mol of acetic acid reacted).

So after the reactions, the solution has:

- OH-: initial 0.10 mol minus 0.05 reacted with acetic acid, so 0.05 mol.

- Acetate: 0.05 mol.

But wait, the acetate can hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

This reaction would produce more OH- ions, which would make the solution more basic.

So, the initial OH- is 0.05 mol, and the acetate can produce additional OH-.

But how much?

This is a bit tricky. Because the acetate ion is a weak base, its hydrolysis will contribute to the OH- concentration. But since the solution already has some OH- (0.05 mol), the acetate's contribution might be small, but in reality, it could affect the pH.

So, perhaps I should model this as a buffer solution, but since the solution is basic, maybe it's better to use the Kb expression.

Wait, but the acetate is a weak base. The Kb for acetate can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 x 10^-5, so Kb is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.56e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Kb is Kw / Ka. So 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = approximately 5.56e-10.

So the Kb is 5.56e-10, which is a very small number, meaning that the hydrolysis of acetate ions produces a small amount of OH-.

But wait, the solution already has some OH- from the initial neutralization. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of OH- is dominated by the initial 0.05 mol, and the hydrolysis of acetate contributes a negligible amount.

Wait, let's compute the concentration of OH- due to the acetate ion's hydrolysis.

The concentration of acetate is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L → ≈0.0416667 M.

The Kb is 5.56e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming that the change in OH- is small compared to the initial 0.05 mol, we can approximate.

Let x be the concentration of OH- produced from acetate hydrolysis.

At equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.0416667 - x ≈ 0.0416667.

[OH^-] = initial 0.0416667 (from the 0.05 mol in 1.2 L) + x.

[CH3COOH] = x.

So,

Kb = (x)(0.0416667 + x) / 0.0416667 ≈ (x)(0.0416667) / 0.0416667 = x.

So,

x ≈ Kb → x ≈ 5.56e-10.

Which is very small compared to the initial 0.0416667 M OH-.

Thus, the contribution from acetate hydrolysis is negligible.

So, the initial calculation of OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, leading to a pOH of about 1.38, and pH of approximately 12.62.

So, the answer would be option A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixture of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. The steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ from strong acid and base
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization between H⁺ and OH⁻
H⁺ and OH⁻ neutralize in a 1:1 ratio:  
- Total H⁺ = \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).  
- After neutralization, \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ remains.

### Step 3: Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but the remaining OH⁻ (strong base) will deprotonate it completely:  
- Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Remaining OH⁻ after neutralization = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  
- OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
  \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 4: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
Concentration of OH⁻:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate pOH and pH
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38.
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**.  
**Answer: A**
