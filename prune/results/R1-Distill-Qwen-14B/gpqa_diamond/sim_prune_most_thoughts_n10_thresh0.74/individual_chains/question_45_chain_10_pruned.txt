Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find their ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies in terms of E, where E is given as pi squared times hbar squared over 2mL squared. 

First, I should remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, each particle's energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²) * (h²)/(8mL²), but wait, the problem defines E as (pi² ℏ²)/(2mL²). Hmm, let me recheck that. Oh wait, the given E is E = π² ℏ²/(2mL²). So I need to express each particle's energy in terms of E.

Wait, what's the energy for a single particle in level n? The standard formula is E_n = (n² π² ℏ²)/(2mL²). Oh! So E_n is just n² multiplied by E, because E is (π² ℏ²)/(2mL²). So E_n = n² * E. Got it.

But wait, these are four identical spin-1/2 particles. So I think this is a problem about the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2 fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. That includes both spatial and spin parts.

So in the ground state, the lowest energy configuration must accommodate all four particles without violating the exclusion principle. Let's think about how the particles can fill up the energy levels.

Each single-particle state is defined by its quantum number n and spin. For spin-1/2, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins: up and down.

So for each energy level n, two particles can occupy the same n (since each has a different spin). But wait, in the case of fermions, each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the first energy level (n=1
