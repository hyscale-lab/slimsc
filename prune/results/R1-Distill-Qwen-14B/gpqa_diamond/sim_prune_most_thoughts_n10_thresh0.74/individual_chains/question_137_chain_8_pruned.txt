Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons. The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy. It undergoes two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with Φ0 being π/4 and U0 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on synchrocyclotrons. Let me think. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particles gain energy. Unlike the classical cyclotron where the frequency is fixed, here the frequency changes to keep the particles in step with the electric field, allowing them to be accelerated beyond the limits of a fixed-frequency cyclotron.

So the key here is probably to calculate the number of revolutions the proton makes as it goes from rest to 950 MeV. Each revolution corresponds to an acceleration by the voltage. But wait, the voltage isn't constant; it's varying with time. So how does that work?

Let me recall the basic principle. In a cyclotron, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field that alternates. The magnetic field causes the particles to follow a circular path, and every half-cycle of the electric field, the particles gain energy. The frequency of the electric field must match the circular motion frequency of the particles for maximum efficiency.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is kept constant, but the electric field's frequency is varied to match the changing velocity of the particles as they gain energy. I think the equation for the number of revolutions depends on the time taken to reach the desired energy and the angular frequency.

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. Let's compute the final velocity or the Lorentz factor first. The kinetic energy (T) is related to the total energy (γmc²) by T = (γ - 1) mc². So solving for γ would give us the Lorentz factor.

Given T = 950 MeV. The mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c². So T = 950 MeV is
