Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reaction steps given. Let's break it down step by step.

The problem starts with compound A reacting with HCN to form B. Then B is reduced to C with H2 and Pd. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D. Finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

First, I'll look at the hints. Hint a says that when compound A reacts with some phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, that sounds like a Wittig reaction because ylides are used in Wittig reactions. So the ylide here is probably the propan-2-ylidene part. The reaction forms an alkene, so A must have a carbonyl group because Wittig reactions convert ketones or aldehydes into alkenes.

Wait, the compound formed is a cyclopentane derivative. So maybe A is a cyclopentanone? Because when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Let me think: reacting a ketone (like cyclopentanone) with HCN would add a hydroxyl and a cyanide group adjacent. So the product would have an -OH and -CN group next to each other.

So then compound B is the cyanohydrin. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, that's hydrogenation. H2 and Pd usually reduce triple bonds, but here B is the cyanohydrin. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group. So maybe the nitrile group (-CN) is reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but with Pd, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation. Let's see: nitrile (RCN) → amine (RCH2NH2?), but wait, I think under hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. Alternatively, maybe the cyanide is converted to an alcohol. Wait, no, reducing nitriles typically gives amines. Wait, or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the cyanohydrin (B) has an -OH and -CN group attached to the same carbon. So structure would be something like (HOCH2CN) attached to the cyclopentane. So when B is reduced, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced to a CH2NH2 group or maybe to an amine, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenation of the nitrile to an amine, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each step. 

1. A → B: HCN adds to carbonyl → cyanohydrin.
2. B → C: H2, Pd → reduces nitrile group? Or the alcohol? Maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine, but that would make the structure more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to an amine group, and the alcohol remains. Or maybe it's the alcohol that gets hydrogenated, but that doesn't make much sense because alcohols generally require higher pressures or different catalysts for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a ketone with a cyanohydrin. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin has an alcohol group and a nitrile on the same carbon. So when you hydrogenate that, maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine. So C would have an amine group attached.

Wait, but then when C reacts with HNO2, which is nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines. Primary amines react to form diazonium salts, but secondary amines might form N-nitrosamines. Wait, but in this case, if C has an amine group, then D would be a diazonium salt or something else. Or perhaps, if
