Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I get the setup right. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving past them in the same direction as the light beam.

Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, isn't this a case involving a medium (glass) moving relative to the lab? So maybe I should think about it using the velocity addition formula from relativity.

Wait, but the glass is a medium through which light propagates. Normally, in a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n. So if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait a second, I'm getting a little confused. Let's break it down.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n because the glass has an index of refraction n. Now, when the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, what's the speed of the light as observed in the lab?

But wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as
