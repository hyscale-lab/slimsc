Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about finding the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state when absorbed. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the states involved. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest energy state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm guessing that the photon's energy needs to match the energy difference between these two states.

The molecule is diatomic, made up of atoms X and Y. The masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so it includes both rotational and vibrational energies. So the total energy levels would be a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized and given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, I think the rotational constant B would vary with the vibrational state. Oh wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the vibrational energy as part of the overall state.

Wait, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition between vibrational or rotational states. But the question says it's moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means it's moving to the next highest energy state, but what's the order of the states?

Wait, the ground state in vibration is the state with the lowest energy for vibration. Then, the next energy state would be the first excited vibrational state. Alternatively, if the molecule is in a rotational state, maybe it can transition to a higher rotational state while remaining in the same vibrational state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, which might imply that it's a transition that requires the least energy. So perhaps it's a vibrational transitionâ€”since for a diatomic, the vibrational
