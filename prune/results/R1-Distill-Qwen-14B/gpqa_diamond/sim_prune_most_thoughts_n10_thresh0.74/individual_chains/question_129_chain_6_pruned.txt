Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through this.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down the reactions and the hints provided.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR peaks: A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones.

Let me start by figuring out what compound A is. The first hint says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an aldehyde or ketone with a ylide. So if A is reacting with a ylide to form an alkene, that suggests A is a carbonyl compound, like an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's draw this mentally. It's a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent at position 4 is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, the ylide would typically add to a carbonyl group. So in the Wittig reaction, the ylide (like Ph3P=CH-) would attack the carbonyl carbon of A, leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a propenyl group (since ylides produce alkenes). So maybe A is a cyclic ketone, and the ylide adds to it, forming an alkene on the ring.

Wait, so if I imagine the product as 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that's a cyclopentane with substituents at 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), and 4 (propenyl group). How would that form from a Wittig reaction?

Wait, the starting material (compound A) would be a carbonyl attached to the ring. So if the Wittig forms
