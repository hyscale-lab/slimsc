Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. But wait, how exactly does that work again? Oh right, the principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

In this problem, the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, but how does that connect? Oh, right, because the uncertainty in momentum Δp is related to the kinetic energy. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so maybe I can express Δp in terms of mass and velocity uncertainty. But wait, the actual velocity isn't given as an uncertainty, but I think the speed is given and perhaps we can assume it's the average or that the uncertainty in velocity is negligible compared to the speed, or maybe we can relate Δp to the kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The minimum uncertainty in energy would probably come from the uncertainty in momentum, because energy is related to momentum. Since the electron has kinetic energy, which is (p²)/(2m). So if I find Δp, I can relate that to ΔE.

Wait, but the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives a lower bound on Δp. Because Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum Δp is ħ/(2Δx). Oh, wait, no,
