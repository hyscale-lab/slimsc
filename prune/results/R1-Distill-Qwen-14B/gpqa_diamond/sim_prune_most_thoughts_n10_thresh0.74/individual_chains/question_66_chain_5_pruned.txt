Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is about writing down all possible higher-dimensional operators that can modify the Standard Model, but they have to respect certain symmetries. 

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one. Because all the operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. So any operator that doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry wouldn't be part of the theory. So 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if Lorentz is already a symmetry, does Poincare symmetry have to be respected? Wait, but Poincare includes not just rotations and boosts but also translations in space and time. In the SMEFT, the operators are built from the Standard Model fields. The SM already respects Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT should too. But wait, the SMEFT is an effective theory valid at a certain scale, so maybe the Poincare symmetry is automatically included because the SM has it and the SMEFT adds higher-dimension terms that don't break it. So 2 is correct as well.

Next, CP symmetry. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that not all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect CP. For example, some operators can have explicit CP violation. But wait, no, the SMEFT allows for operators with different CP properties, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if any operator doesn't respect CP, then 3 isn't a must. So the answer doesn't require all operators to have CP symmetry. So 3 is not necessarily respected.

Finally, CPT symmetry. I think that CPT is more fundamental. In quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a big deal. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory of the SM, which respects CPT. So any operator added in SMEFT must also respect CPT, otherwise the theory would violate it, which is not possible. Therefore, 4 is correct.

So putting it together, which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,
