Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectral data. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, right? So there's probably an ester functional group in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Two are aromatic-H, two are vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two are –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So the structure must have aromatic protons, vinyl protons, and some methyl groups, but no methylene (CH2) groups.

Let me try to visualize the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in the para, ortho, or meta positions. But wait, the NMR has six signals, so maybe each substituent contributes some unique protons.

The presence of an ester group suggests that one substituent is an ester, like OCOOR. But wait, esters can come from carboxylic acids and alcohols, so something like R-O-CO-O-R' maybe? Or more accurately, an ester would be RCOOR', where R and R' are substituents.

But wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. Esters can have methyl groups if R' is methyl, but maybe another substituent has a methyl group as well.

Let me think about the substituents. One substituent is an ester group, which could be a methoxycarbonyl group (like OMe-CO- attached), but that would be an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a benzoyl group, but that's less likely since we have CH3 signals.

Another substituent could be a vinyl group. Wait, the NMR shows vinyl protons. So maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group, like a substituent with a double bond adjacent to the ring.

Wait, vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear around 4-7 ppm, but the exact region depends on the substituents and the structure. So if there are vinyl protons, that suggests a substituent with a double bond attached to the aromatic ring. Maybe something like a substituted vinyl group, like a CH2=CH– group attached.

Wait, but wait. The substituent could be a group like a methyl acrylate or something similar. Alternatively, the substituent could be a side chain with a double bond, such as an allyl group.

Wait, the two vinyl protons in the NMR: one is a doublet, another is a doublet of quartets. So perhaps the substituent is a trans double bond, or maybe it's a geminal substituent?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethenyl group (CH2=CH–) attached to the ring. But then, the ethenyl group would have two protons, each split into a doublet due to coupling with each other. But if it's attached to another group that causes more splitting, like adjacent to
