Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, let's see. So, the question says that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos(alpha) - 2ln cos(beta) - 2mn cos(gamma)). Or is it? I think that's for a general crystal system, especially when the lattice isn't cubic.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So in this case, a=b=c=10 Angstrom, and each angle is 30 degrees.

The plane is (111), so l=1, m=1, n=1. Plugging those into the formula.

Let me write down the formula again to make sure I have it right. The interplanar distance d_hkl for Miller indices (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(alpha) - 2hl cos(beta) - 2kl cos(gamma) )

Wait, but actually, in some conventions, the formula is written as d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )) ). Since in rhombohedral, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, so cos(alpha) is same for all.

So let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute the numerator: a is 10 Angstrom.

The denominator inside the sqrt is:

(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30) - 2*(1*1)*cos(30)

Wait wait, no. Wait, the formula is h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ. But since all angles are 30, that simplifies.

So:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So compute:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then the other terms:

- 2hk cos α = -2*(1)(1)*cos(30) = -2*(sqrt(3)/2) = -sqrt(3).

Similarly, -2hl cos β = same as above, another -sqrt(3).

And -2kl cos gamma = another -sqrt(3).

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - [sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)].

Wait, because each -2hk cos term is subtracted, so:

3 - (3 * sqrt(3)).

Wait, but that would be adding up the three terms. Let me calculate:

Each term is -2 * cos(30) for the cross
