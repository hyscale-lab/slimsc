Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

The problem says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, wait, that means from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because if one frame sees the other moving at v, the other sees the first moving at v in the opposite direction, assuming they're inertial frames. Oh, but wait, the problem states that both are inertial, so yeah, they're moving at the same speed relative to each other.

The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. But to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, I think I need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in their own time and then convert that time into the Galaxy's frame, or maybe the other way around. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, no, because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance should be speed multiplied by time. But wait, what's the time in the Galaxy's frame? Because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, but due to time dilation, the Galaxy would measure a different time, right?

Wait, that's where relativity comes in. So I need to consider time dilation between the two frames. Oh, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity and time problem without worrying about acceleration.

Wait, the problem states that both frames are inertial. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

But wait, in the problem, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So the ejecta's motion is 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in t Galaxy time, the distance would be 60,000 * t, where t is
