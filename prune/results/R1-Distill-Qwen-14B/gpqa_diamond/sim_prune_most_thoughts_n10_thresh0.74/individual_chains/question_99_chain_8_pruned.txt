Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The compound has been analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several signals, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Two specific signals are mentioned: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. The options are four different compounds, which I'll need to analyze.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the IR also has a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So what functional groups have both O-H and C=O? Carboxylic acids have both. They have an -OH group and a carbonyl group. So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all of them end with COOH, except maybe I need to double-check. Option A: ...CH2COOH. Option B: ...COOH. C: ...CH2COOH. D: ...COOH. So all are carboxylic acids. So that part makes sense.

Next, looking at the NMR. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, which aligns with all the options because they're all single bonds in the structures.

Now, the NMR signals. Two specific signals are complex. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. The more neighboring Hs, the more splitting.

Let me break down the splitting. For the first signal: doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's parse that. A quartet is from three neighboring Hs (n+1=4 implies n=3). So maybe this proton is next to a CH3 group, which has 3 Hs. Then a triplet would come from being adjacent to a CH2 group (n=2), leading to a triplet. Wait, but it's a doublet of triplet of quartets. Maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, each split comes from different neighboring groups. Let me think: a quartet (from a CH3), a triplet (from a CH2), and a doublet (from another CH3 or something else?), but that's getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to two different coupling partners.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a geminal di-substitution, where two groups are attached to the same carbon. For example, a CH2 group next to two different types of protons.

Another approach is to look at each option's structure and predict their NMR signals.

Let me list the options again:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2... Wait, no, wait. Let me parse the formula correctly.

Wait, the options are written as:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

So that would be a carbon chain where the COOH is attached to a central carbon, which has substituents. Let's see. The central part is C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3). So each of those central carbons (assuming the structure is something like C(C(H)(CH3))(C(H)(CH3))), which is a geminal di-substitution with two CH(CH3) groups attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no. Let me write out each option's structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So it's CH2COOH connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a central carbon. That central C is attached to two C(H)(C2H5) groups. So the structure would be CH2-CO-OH attached to a central carbon that has two CH groups each attached to an ethyl group.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: COOH attached to a central carbon which is connected to two CH groups each attached to an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3CH2, maybe? Wait, the central structure is C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5). So each side is CH with an ethyl group. So that carbon is CH2 maybe?

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw them mentally.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each option's structure and the NMR signals they would produce.

The key is to find which structure would lead to complex splitting patterns as described.

The key points from NMR:

- No vinyl protons. So all structures are single bonds.
- The splitting in the signals suggests several coupling partners.

In the problem, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down.

Each split comes from a different neighboring group. So for a quartet, that implies a neighboring group with 3 Hs. A triplet implies a group with 2 Hs. A doublet implies a group with 1 H.

But how can a proton
