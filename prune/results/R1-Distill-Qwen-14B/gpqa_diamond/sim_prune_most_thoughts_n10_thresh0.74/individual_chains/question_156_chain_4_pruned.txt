Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral ones. I need to determine how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically occurs in alkenes, adding an oxygen to form an epoxide. Since each reaction uses one equivalent of mCPBA, I guess each alkene will form an epoxide.

Wait, but the structure here is oct-4-ene. So the molecule is CH2CH2 groups on either side of the double bond. The (E) and (Z) configurations would affect how the epoxide forms.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. The E isomer has the two substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3 groups, I think) on opposite sides. When mCPBA reacts, it would form an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is trans, the epoxide will form with the oxygen bridge between the same faces? Or does it form a trans epoxide?

Wait, no, I think the reaction forms an epoxide where the oxygen is in a specific configuration. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide will form in a particular way. I remember that when an epoxide forms from a trans double bond, the oxygen atoms end up on the same face. So the epoxide would have a trans stereochemistry. Or wait, perhaps the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, another thought: mCPBA adds an epoxide via a peracid mechanism, which typically leads to the formation of the more substituted epoxide. Since both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene are symmetric in structure (I think, because it's (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetric double bond), perhaps the epoxide derived from each would have different stereochemistry.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, octane is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 4-ene would mean double bond between C4 and C5. So it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait no, that can
