Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress the gene, but when they test the expression, it's not working as expected. The problem is with the sequence of the construct's plus strand, which they provided. The options given are about why the overexpression isn't happening.

First, I need to look at the construct's sequence they provided. The construct is designed to express GADD45G with an N-terminal HA tag. The HA tag is a small peptide derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. It's often used as an epitope tag for protein detection.

Looking at the sequence, the start codon is at the very beginning: 5'ATG. Then follows the HA tag sequence. Wait, but what's the HA tag's sequence? I remember that the HA tag is usually something like YPYDVPDYA. But in the construct, perhaps the HA is being added at the N-terminus, so it would be right after the start codon.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. So the HA tag's coding sequence would start right after the ATG. Let me think about the HA tag's DNA sequence. The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The DNA for that would be TAC TTC TAT GTA TTA TAT TTA TAT, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the specific HA sequence is shorter or modified. But the main point is that the HA tag's coding sequence must be present right after the start codon.

Wait a second, looking at the sequence, the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyr), then CCA (pro), then TAC (tyr), etc. So that would translate to Tyr Pro Tyr..., which doesn't match
