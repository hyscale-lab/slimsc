Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny mass, often considered massless in these problems. 

So the pion is at rest initially. That means the total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and the neutrino after decay should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Right, because momentum is conserved.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I think the neutrino's mass is negligible, so we can ignore it. 

The goal is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Wait, but neutrinos are hard to detect because they have such low energy, but maybe in this problem it's just a calculation.

Let me recall the conservation laws. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. 

Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. The total energy must also be conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu*c² + K_mu. Since the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, E_mu is 105.7 + K_mu.

As for the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, its energy E_nu is approximately equal to its kinetic energy, because the rest mass is zero. So E_nu ≈ K_nu.

So putting it together: (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu = 139.6.

Hmm, but that's just one equation with two unknowns. I need another equation from momentum conservation.

Momentum is conserved, so the magnitude of the muon's momentum p_mu equals the neutrino's momentum p_nu.

The muon's momentum can be found using the relativistic relation: p_mu^2 c² = E_mu² - (m_mu c²)^2.

Similarly, for the neutrino, since m_nu is nearly zero, E_nu^2 = p_nu^2 c².

Since p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as this common momentum.

So, E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

And E_nu = p c.

Now, substituting into the energy equation: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

E_nu = p c

So, sqrt(p² c^2 + 105.7²) + p c = 139.6.

Let me make this equation dimensionally correct, but since all terms are in MeV (assuming c=1), maybe I can ignore the c factors for simplicity. So let's write:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me let x = p. Then the equation becomes sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for x. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x² + a²) = b - x,

where a is 105.7, and b is 139.6.

So, sqrt(x² + a²) = b - x.

Squaring both sides: x² + a² = (b - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: b² - 2b x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: a² = b² - 2b x.

So, 2b x = b² - a².

x = (b² - a²)/(2b).

Let me compute that.

b is 139.6, a is 105.7.

b squared: 139.6^2. Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 140 - 0.4.

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a squared: 105.7^2. Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So, numerator is (19488.16 - 11172.49) = 8315.67.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 gives 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's lower than 8315.67. 

Wait, perhaps 29.7?

Wait, let me compute 279.2 * 29.7.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

Minus 279.2 *0.3=83.76.

So 29.7 gives 8376 - 83.76=8292.24.

That's close to 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.

So, 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So x ≈ 29.7 + 0.084=29.784. Let's say approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but units are in MeV/c? Because p is in units of MeV/c when E is in MeV. Hmm, but since we set c=1, perhaps x is in units where c=1, so x is in MeV? Not sure, but perhaps it doesn't matter for the calculation.

So, x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but if p = x, then E_nu = p c, but if our units have c=1, then E_nu is just x. So E_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's energy is around 29.78 MeV, which would be its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

Now, let's find E_mu. E_mu = sqrt(x^2 + a^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + 105.7^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: approximately 887. Maybe 29^2=841, 0.78^2≈0.6, and cross terms 2*29*0.78=45. So 841+45+0.6=886.6.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu^2 = 886.6 + 11172.49 = 12059.09.

E_mu ≈ sqrt(12059) = approx 109.8 MeV? Wait, sqrt(12059) is about 109.8 since 110^2=12100, so 109.8^2= approx 12056.04, which is close. So E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, earlier when we said that E_mu + E_nu = 139.6, let's check:

109.8 + 29.78 ≈ 139.58 MeV, which is about 139.6, so that matches. Good, so our calculation seems consistent.

So E_mu is 109.8 MeV. But E_mu is the total energy, so the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu c^2.

m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV. So K_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV approximately.

Wait, wait, 109.8 - 105.7 is 4.1 MeV. So the muon has KE≈4.1 MeV, and the neutrino has KE≈29.78 MeV. 

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our calculation. 

So the answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as:  
\[
m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}, \quad m_\nu \approx 0 \, \text{(negligible)}.
\]

### Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+}c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum after the decay must be zero. This implies the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The total energy of the muon is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu^+}c)^2 + (m_{\mu^+}c^2)^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino, since its mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum:  
\[
E_\nu \approx p_\nu c.
\]

### Solving for Momentum
Using energy conservation and the relativistic relation for the muon's energy, we solve for the common momentum \(p\):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(x = p\). Squaring both sides and simplifying:  
\[
x = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]  
Calculating:  
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49, \quad x = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, the neutrino's energy is:  
\[
E_\nu = p_\nu c \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's total energy is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The muon's kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+}c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.1 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. This matches **Option D**.  

**Answer: D**
