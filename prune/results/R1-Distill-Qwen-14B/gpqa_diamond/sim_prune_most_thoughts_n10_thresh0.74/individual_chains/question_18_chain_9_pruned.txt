Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the elemental abundances in two stars. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll try to parse all the given data. Let's list out what's provided:

Star_1:
- Mass = 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the abundance of silicon relative to iron is higher by 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun.

Star_2:
- Mass = 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. The abundance of magnesium relative to silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Magnesium relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.

Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5? Wait, no. Wait, the equation is 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5) ≈ 3.16e-6.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The Sun's numbers are given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, and similarly for Mg. So for Fe:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, wait, no. The given sun composition is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So:

For Fe: log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

For Mg: log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

But wait, the [Fe/H] for Star_1 is zero. So, [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(solar nFe/nH) =0. So, star_1's nFe/nH = solar nFe/nH, which is 3.16e-5.

Same for Star_2, [Mg/H] is zero, so nMg/nH = solar nMg/nH =1e-5.

But I'm more interested in the silicon and magnesium in each star.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

How do I get nSi for each star?

Hmm. Let's think about each star.

For Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(solar nX/nY). So, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(solar nSi/nFe) =0.3.

Wait, but we know the solar nSi/nFe. Let me find that. Because in the Sun, nSi is related to nFe and nMg via other measurements.

Wait, in the Sun, the composition is given for Fe and Mg. But what about Si? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the solar ratio of nSi/nFe. Because for Star_1, I can find its nSi relative to nFe, and then relate that to the solar ratio.

But wait, the Sun's composition: Do I have enough data to get nSi/nH or nSi/nFe?

Hmm. Let me think
