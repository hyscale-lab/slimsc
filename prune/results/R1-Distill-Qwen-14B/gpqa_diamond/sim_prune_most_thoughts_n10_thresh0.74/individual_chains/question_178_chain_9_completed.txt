Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and some properties. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think this is some interaction term, maybe something related to a gauge field because there's an F tensor, which is the field strength tensor.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should probably look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), right? So each term in the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 because the action S is dimensionless and S = ∫ d^4x L, so L must have dimension [Mass]^4.

So breaking down the term, let's think about each component:

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

I remember that for a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because in 4 dimensions, the Dirac equation has terms like ∂ψ which must balance. Since ∂ has dimension 1, ψ has dimension 3/2 to make the equation dimensionally consistent.

So ψ̄ (which is ψ^† γ^0) has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Since it's built from γ matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions), and the structure is a commutator of γ's. So the dimension of σ_{μν} is the same as [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is zero because γ matrices are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field like electromagnetism, F is built from derivatives and gauge fields. The field tensor F has dimension 2 because each derivative (from ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ) brings a mass dimension of 1, and each A has dimension 1 (since the kinetic term is (∂A)^2, so each A is [Mass]^1). So F is [∂ A] = [Mass]^2, no wait, wait. Wait, no: the field tensor is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each term in F is ∂ A, so each F^{μν} has dimension [Mass]^1 * [A], where [A] is dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For a gauge field A_mu, the term in the Lagrangian like F^2 would be (∂ A)^2, so each F has dimension 2, because (∂ has 1, A has 1; (∂ A) is 2, so F squared is (∂ A)^2, each F is 2? Wait, no: the field strength tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each term in F is [∂][A]. Since A has dimension 1, ∂ is 1, so each F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term in the Lagrangian is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

So each factor's dimension:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ_{μν}: 0
ψ: 3/2
F^{μν}: 2

So the product of these is (3/2) * 0 (wait, no, σ_{μν} is part of the term, but it's a matrix, so dimensionless. So the product is (3/2) * 0? No, wait, σ_{μν} is just a coefficient, so it's dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

Then multiply by F^{μν}, which is 2. So the term becomes κ * (3) * (2) = κ *6. Wait, no, the product of the dimensions is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2. Oh, wait, the entire term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is (3/2 + 3/2) + 2 = 3 + 2 =5? Wait, no, wait each component's dimension:

ψ̄ has dim 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ has dim 3. σ is dimensionless. F has dim 2. So the product is 3 * 2 =6.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by something with dim 6. The Lagrangian has to have dim 4. So:

[κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] *6 =4.

So [κ] = 4 /6 = 2/3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Wait, when you multiply terms, their dimensions add. So the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) (F). So the dimensions are:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] +3/2 +0 +3/2 +2 = [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) +2= [κ] +3 +2= [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian's dimension is 4, so [κ] +5=4 → [κ]= -1.

Oh, that's right. So the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is option A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants (here, κ) must have positive mass dimension (as in, their dimension is ≥0). Because in renormalizable theories, the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions, which means that the interaction terms are of lower dimension than the volume element (since the Lagrangian is dimension 4, and each term needs to be dimension 4 as well). Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: in quantum field theory, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is less than or equal to 4. Because the term is multiplied by a coupling constant, and the coupling's dimension affects renormalizability.

Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≤4. But wait, no, the coupling constants themselves have certain dimensions. For a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling should be such that the term has dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is: each interaction term in the Lagrangian should have dimension ≤4. But the coupling constants' dimensions can be negative, which would imply that the term is more relevant or not.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Because in perturbation theory, loops can be renormalized if the couplings are of positive mass dimension. Alternatively, another way to think about it: the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the number of loop integrals (each loop brings a mass dimension of 4), and the number of propagators and vertices. But perhaps that's a bit more involved.

Alternatively, the theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms have dimension ≤4. Because in the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4, so when you have a term like (coupling) * (fields), the coupling's dimension is [4 - dim(fields)].

Wait, but in our case, the term is dimension 4. Let's see: for the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, the product of fields is 3+2=5, as I calculated earlier. So [κ] is -1, which makes their product 4. So the term is renormalizable only if the coupling is of a certain type.

Wait, but in general, if the coupling has a negative mass dimension, like [κ] = -1 here, that means the interaction term is dimension 4, but the coupling is dimension -1. But for a renormalizable theory, all couplings should have non-negative dimensions, right?

Wait, no, wait: in 4 dimensions, any term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for a term like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n [φ] =4. If [φ] is d, then [g] =4 -n d.

For the theory to be renormalizable, each coupling's dimension must be ≥0, so 4 -n d ≥0 → n ≤4/d.

In our problem, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The fields are ψ (dimension 3/2), F (dimension 2). So the term is κ (ψ̄ψ) F. Wait, ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar, dimension 3, and F is dimension 2. So the term is κ * (3) * (2) = κ *6, and the Lagrangian has dimension 4, so [κ] =4-5= -1.

Now, for renormalizability: in QED, the coupling e (for the interaction term e ψ̄ γ^μ ψ A_μ) has [e] =0. Because ψ̄ γ ψ is dimension 3, A is dimension 1, so [e] +3 +1 =4 → [e]=0. So e is dimensionless, and QED is renormalizable.

In our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. So the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4, but the coupling has negative mass dimension. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling is of negative mass dimension. 

Wait, but why? Because in perturbation theory, higher loop diagrams require higher powers of the coupling, and if the coupling has negative mass dimension, each loop brings in factors of energy scales (like the momentum integral), which could make the amplitudes divergent. Or perhaps it's because the interaction term is nonrenormalizable if the coupling has negative mass dimension. 

So putting it together, κ has dimension -1, which is option A or C.

The options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable.

So, since [κ]=-1, and the theory isn't renormalizable, the correct option is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in natural units (\( \hbar = c = 1 \)), as the action \( S = \int d^4x \, \mathcal{L} \) is dimensionless. We break down the dimensions of each term in the interaction Lagrangian:

- \( \bar{\psi} \) (or \( \psi \)) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), as it is a Dirac spinor.
- \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is a commutator of dimensionless \( \gamma \)-matrices, so it is dimensionless.
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor, which has mass dimension 2, as it is constructed from derivatives (\( \partial_\mu \)) and gauge fields (\( A_\nu \)), each contributing a dimension of 1.

The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has mass dimension:
\[
\text{dim}(\bar{\psi}) + \text{dim}(\psi) + \text{dim}(\sigma_{\mu\nu}) = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 = 3.
\]
Including \( F^{\mu\nu} \), the full term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension:
\[
\text{dim}(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi) + \text{dim}(F^{\mu\nu}) = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
\text{dim}(\kappa) + \text{dim}(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}) = 4.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{dim}(\kappa) + 5 = 4 \implies \text{dim}(\kappa) = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, \( \kappa \) has a mass dimension of \( -1 \), which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is nonrenormalizable because it introduces divergences that cannot be absorbed into a finite number of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:

**C) The mass dimension \( [\kappa]_M = -1 \). The theory is not renormalizable.**
