Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another structure. The reaction typically forms a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, or sometimes a different diene depending on the structure.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a bridge with two carbons and another with two, and a bridgehead of one. The 2-azabicyclo means there's a nitrogen at position 2. And there's a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?) at position 2 as well. Wait, no, 2-vinyl would be a CH2=CH- group attached to the bicyclo structure at position 2.

Wait, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has seven members. So, the numbering is a bit tricky. The 2-azabicyclo implies that the nitrogen is at position 2. Then, position 5 has a double bond. So the structure might look like a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, so this is similar but with a substituent and a different double bond.

But wait, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]
