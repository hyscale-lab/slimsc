Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, which causes brightness variations that look like those caused by an exoplanet. 

The main question is: What would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots do? So we're comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet blocking the star's light to the dip caused by the spots.

First, I think I need to model both scenarios. The planet causing a dip when it transits in front of the star. The spots causing a dip because when they rotate into view, they're darker, so the total brightness decreases. 

Let me break this down.

For the planet transit: The change in brightness (delta F) is given by the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I remember is delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks that part of the star's light, so the dip is proportional to the area blocked.

For the star spots: The spots are cooler, so when they face us, they contribute less to the total light. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. The amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the spots and how much less bright they are compared to the rest of the star.

The problem says the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the total area covered is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is half the star. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (4π R^2 / 2) ) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total surface area of the star is 4π R^2. The hemisphere is 2π R^2. So if the filling factor is 20%, the area of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². 

But wait, the problem says the star is observed in such a way that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a limb-darkened disk. So the effective area causing the dip is the area of the spots on the hemisphere that's facing us. 

Now, when the star rotates, the spots on the front hemisphere will rotate in and out of view. So the maximum dip in brightness occurs when all the spots are on the visible side. The dip amplitude is the difference between the full star brightness and the star with spots visible.

The brightness of the star without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the brightness is L = L0 * (1 - F) + L_spots, where F is the filling factor and L_spots is the contribution of the spots. But wait, spots are darker, so they contribute less. Hmm, perhaps better to model it as the total flux.

The unspotted part of the hemisphere (the other part of the hemisphere not covered by spots) is at Teff, but the spots are cooler. Wait, perhaps I should compute the total flux emitted by the star when the spots are visible.

Alternatively, let's think about the flux from the spots versus the rest of the star's surface.

The total flux from the star without any spots is F_total = σ Teff^4 * 4π R² (assuming the star is a perfect blackbody).

When the spots are present on a hemisphere, the hemisphere's surface is 2π R². The spots
