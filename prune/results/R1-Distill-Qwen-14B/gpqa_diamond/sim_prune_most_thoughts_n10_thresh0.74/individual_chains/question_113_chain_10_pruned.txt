Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the given data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's analyze each one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. That usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the presence of a broad peak could also suggest something else. Then, there's a peak at 1700 and another at 1650. The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated or an aromatic ring? Or maybe it's an amide or something else. Hmm, but given the options, maybe it's a ketone or ester or something.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond somewhere. That's useful info.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragment would correspond to that. Common fragments at 45 include the methyl group (CH3) as 15, but wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, a fragment with a carbonyl group? Let me think, 45 could be the (CH3)CO+ ion, like from an ester or a ketone. Wait, CH2=CHCOOH might fragment to something else. Or perhaps it's a (CH3)CO group, which is 59, but that's higher. Wait, 45 is C3H7O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene? Or maybe a smaller fragment like an -OCH2CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Now, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's think about each formula and see which fits the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C=6, H=12, O=2. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is likely. But wait, one degree could be a ring and a double bond? Or maybe a double bond and an oxygen ring? Hmm, maybe more. Wait, perhaps I should recalculate. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's compute for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. So DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be a double bond or a ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So if DoU is 1, maybe a double bond and no rings, or a ring and a double bond?

Wait, no, each double bond or ring counts as one. So if DoU is one, either a ring or a double bond, or one each. Wait, no, each ring or double bond is one DoU. So one DoU can be either a ring or a double bond.

But if the compound has a double bond (from the vinyl H's), then the DoU must be at least one, which it is for option A.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (12 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU: (14 -10)/2= 2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU: (14 -12)/2=1. So same as A.

So, looking at the options, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so the DoU must be at least one. But some options have higher DoU. Let's think about the IR data. The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is probably O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. The other peaks at 1700 and 165
