Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms. 

Alright, so the setup is that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, that probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation here. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. Right, the formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Let's say the excited state is level i and the lower state is level j. 

So, n_i1 / n_i2 = 2. And according to the Boltzmann equation, n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) are the same for both stars because they're the same element, iron. So g_i/g_j would be the same ratio for both stars. Wait, but in the ratio n_i1/n_i2, would the g_i/g_j cancel out? 

Wait, let me think again. For each star, n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ). So for star_1, it's (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, it's (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

So when I take the ratio n_i1 / n_i2, that would be [ (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k) ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ). 

Wait, because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So it's exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ) ) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) ). 

Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the ratio becomes exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) ) = 2, since n_i1/n_i2 is 2. 

So,

exp( ΔE (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2) ) = 2.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides,

ΔE (T1 - T2) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln 2.

Wait, but the question is about the equation for the effective temperatures. The options involve ln(2) on one side, and some function of T1 and T2 on the other. So let's rearrange this equation.

Let me write it again:

(ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Hmm, but wait the options have ln(2) equal to something. So let's rearrange:

ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2).

But wait, the problem doesn't give ΔE in terms of k or anything else, so maybe we can't directly use the numbers. Or perhaps the 1.38e-23 J is given, which is the same as k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Oh wait! Because Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since ΔE = k). Because 1.38e-23 J is the same as k * 1 K. So, substituting ΔE = k, because k is 1.38e-23 J/(K), so when you multiply by 1 K, you get 1.38e-23 J. 

So ΔE = k * 1 K, but in the equation, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k. Because k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k. 

So putting that into the equation:

ln(2) = (k (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, yes, because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) is (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches.

Let me check the options again:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I didn't substitute ΔE =k, then the equation would have ΔE/(k) = (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln 2. But since ΔE =k, ΔE/k =1, so (T1-T2)/(T1 T2)= ln 2, which is option D.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars, we use the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population ratio of two energy levels in a gas to the temperature and energy difference between the levels. The Boltzmann equation is:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of the populations of the excited energy level is given as \(n_{i1}/n_{i2} = 2\). Assuming the statistical weights \(g_i/g_j\) are the same for both stars, the ratio simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{i2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(n_{i1}/n_{i2} = 2\), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to the Boltzmann constant \(k\). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
