Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically about creating a transgenic mouse model for a protein called GADD45G. The goal is to overexpress it and study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. But the problem is that the overexpression isn't happening as expected, and I need to figure out why.

Let me read through the question again. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine. They're selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies and testing the expression. But the protein isn't being overexpressed.

Looking at the plus strand sequence they provided, I see it starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. The sequence continues with various codons. The options given are about possible issues in the construct that prevent proper protein expression.

Option A says there's a missense mutation in the hemagglutinin sequence. If the HA tag has a mutation, that could affect protein expression or recognition, but maybe not prevent it entirely. It could affect purification but perhaps the construct is still expressed. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option B is about the ribosome terminating early. That would mean a premature stop codon, perhaps. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA in the wrong place, the ribosome would stop translating early. I should check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons after the ATG.

Option C suggests the lack of a linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is right at the N-terminus and there's no linker, maybe the protein is being degraded. But the problem is that the construct isn't being expressed, not that the protein is unstable. If it's not expressed, proteolysis would happen after it's made, but maybe the expression is failing earlier.

Option D is about a missing tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But wait, in the coding sequence, any stop codons would terminate translation. But if the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse, that might cause issues during translation. Wait, but in the mRNA, the stop codons are read by the ribosome. So if the construct is in the mouse, the mouse's tRNAs are used. The question is, do mouse cells have tRNAs that recognize UAA? I think UAA and UAG are less common stop codons, but they are functional. If the gene construct has a UAA as a stop codon in the coding sequence, perhaps prematurely, then the ribosome would stop, causing truncated proteins. But why would the GADD45G not be expressed at all?

Wait, looking at the sequence they provided. Let me scan through it.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons. Let's see: the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), etc.

Wait, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me parse the sequence into triplets to see if any are UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking for these:

Looking for UAA: any triplet of U-A-A. Let me scan the codons.

After ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAA, GAA, GCC, etc. I don't see obvious UAA or UAG in the initial part. But wait, maybe later?

Wait, let's go through the entire sequence. Let's break it down into codons.

The sequence is:
