Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The setup is that they did an experiment on white lupine to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene to make mutants g1, g2, g3. Then they also made double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3.

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. So if one is a TF, it might be controlling the others.

They tested these mutants for resistance to the pathogen. The control has 100% resistance. The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than control)
- g2: 0% (no resistance, so really susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (super susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (so both double mutants with g2 are 0%)
- g1g2: 0% (same)

The question is about the interaction between these genes. The options are A, B, C, D, each making different claims about which is the TF and the relationships between the genes.

Hmm. So I should probably think about how gene interactions work. Let's recall that when you have epistasis, it's about how the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of A masks the effect of B.

Also, double mutants can give clues. If a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single, it suggests that the two genes function in separate pathways. If the double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests that the two genes are in the same pathway.

Wait, in this case, the resistance level is lower as the mutants are more susceptible. So a lower percentage means more susceptibility.

Looking at the data:

g2 is completely susceptible (0%). So without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. That suggests that G2 is very important. Maybe it's the transcription factor because if it's a TF, it's upstream. So if G2 is a TF, then knocking it out would disable the expression of downstream genes, leading to no resistance.

Now looking at the single mutants:

g1 has 75% resistance. So only 25% less than control. So G1's function isn't as critical as G2.

g3 has 50% resistance. So it's half as effective.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0%—same as g2. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone. That suggests that the function of G1 might not be necessary if G2 is already knocked out. So G1's role is perhaps downstream of G2. Like, G2 is upstream, and G1 is downstream. So if G2 is not working, even if G1 is present, the downstream can't function. So that would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, because in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2. So the presence or absence of G1 doesn't matter when G2 is gone. That suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is upstream, then without G2, G1 can't do anything. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at g2g3: 0%. So without G2, even if G3 is knocked out, it's same as g2. So again, G2 is upstream.

What about g1g3? Their double mutant is 10%. So lower than either single mutant (g1 is 75, g3 is 50). So combining g1 and g3 makes things worse. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, the double mutant would be as bad as the more severe single. But 10% is worse than either, so they might be in separate pathways, and each contributes to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the plant is much more susceptible.

Wait, but another possibility is that they are redundant. Like, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. That's called gene redundancy. So if both are knocked out, you lose both copies, making the phenotype worse. So that would fit the 10% result.

So looking at the options, which option says that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant, with G1 epistatic to G3? Or something like that.

Wait, the options are:

Option A: G1 is TF, others show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (pleiotropy?), G3 epistatic to G1.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm.

From the data, we saw that G2 is a TF because it's the single mutant that's completely susceptible. So G2 is upstream.

Now, g1g3 has 10% which is lower than either single. So their effects are additive or perhaps they are in separate pathways. That's the scenario for gene redundancy—because if each gene contributes a part, knocking both leads to worse effect.

Alternatively, if they were in the same pathway, perhaps their double knockout would have the same as the more severe single, but in this case, g1g3 is worse than both. So that suggests that they are in separate pathways, and each contributes to the resistance.

But I'm trying to think about the options. Let's see:

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So they do the same function, so knocking both leads to a more severe phenotype. That would fit with the g1g3 double mutant being 10%—so yes, gene redundancy.

Epistasis in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 being upstream of G3. Because if G1 is upstream, then G1's knockout would mask the effect of G3.

Wait, but in the data, when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. When G3 is knocked out, 50%. So G3 has a more severe effect. So if G1 is upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would mean that G3 can't function. So G3 would be downstream. So if G1 is upstream, then knocking G1 would make the downstream G3 not work either, but that's not the case here. Because in the single mutants, G1 knockout is better than G3 knockout.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%. So both are knocked out. So if G1 is upstream of G3, then in the double mutant, both are nonfunctional. So perhaps the resistance would be worse than each single. So that would fit.

But let's see the other double mutants. The double g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G1, because without G2, G1 can't function.

Similarly, the double g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is upstream of G3 as well. So G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

Wait, that makes sense. So G2 is a transcription factor, and it's activating G1 and G3. So if G2 is knocked out,
