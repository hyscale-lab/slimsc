Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read through the question again and break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each part.

First, gas W: it has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. The molecule's total protons and neutrons are the same? Or each atom in the molecule? No, I think it's that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in each molecule. For example, if the molecule is H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). But that's 2 + 8 = 10 protons, and 0 + 8 = 8 neutrons. So 10 vs. 8, which aren't equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another example: maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 would be 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. For neutrons, 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, that's same as protons. So the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule. So that fits.

Wait, but CO2 has a molecular formula of CO2. Let me count: C is atomic number 6 (so 6 protons), each O is 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*(8) = 22. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So yes, same number of protons and neutrons
