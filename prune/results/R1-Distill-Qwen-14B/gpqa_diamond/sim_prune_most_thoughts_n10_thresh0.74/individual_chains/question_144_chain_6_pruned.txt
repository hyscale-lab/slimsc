Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, and they're all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and speed. Oh right, the formula I think is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau? Oh right, the proper lifetime tau is related to the particle's width. The uncertainty principle says that the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is tau ≈ ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. I think the formula for the mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor of the moving particle. Oh wait, no, no. Gamma is the total decay width, which is a relativistic quantity. So the proper lifetime is tau
