Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their radial velocity variations can tell us something about their masses. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. Oh right, that's the orbital period of the binary system. So the orbital period for system_1 is longer than system_2. 

Then there's spectroscopic data. System_1's stars have radial velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10. Radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed at which the stars move towards or away from us, right? And these amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars in the system.

I think the radial velocity method uses the fact that the more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the mass of each star is inversely proportional to their velocity amplitude. Like, M1/M2 = (v2)/(v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of each star. Because the center of mass is such that M1 * v1 = M2 * v2.

So for each system, I can find the mass ratio, then maybe find the total mass and compare the two systems.

Let me think about system_1 first. The two velocity amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. So for system_1, M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2. Wait, so if M1 is 0.5 * M2, then the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5M2 + M2 = 1.5M2. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need the individual masses or the total.

Wait, the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So I need to find (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2).

But I need to relate the velocities to the masses. The formula I remember is that the mass ratio (q) is (M2/M1) = (v1)/(v2). Or wait, let's get it right. The velocity of each star is inversely proportional to their masses. So M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1: v1=10, v2=5. So M1/M2 =5/10=0.5. That means M1 =0.5 M2. So the total mass of system1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. Wait, but wait, no. Because for system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So let me clarify: in system_1, the two stars have velocities v1 and v2, and M1 is the mass of the star with velocity v1, and M2 is the mass of the star with v2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the mass function. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass ratio q = M2 / M1 = v1 / v2. So for system_1, q1 = v1 / v2 = 10 /5 = 2. So M2 is twice M1. So the masses are M1 and 2M1. So the total mass is M1 + 2M1 = 3 M1. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation here.

Wait, let's define it more clearly. For each binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center. So if you have
