Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars with spots and how they affect the light curve, and comparing that to an exoplanet transit. 

So the scenario is: we have a star similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The observations show brightness variations because the star is rotating, which modulates the spots in our line of sight. This setup is making the star's light curve look similar to one with an exoplanet transiting in front.

The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do. So, we're to find Rpl/Rstar, the ratio of planet radius to star radius.

Wait, so normally, when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star. The area is π(Rpl)^2 / π(Rstar)^2 = (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So the depth would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2, right? But here, the spots are causing a variation, not a fixed transit.

But in this case, the spots are causing a modulation every rotation period. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. As the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip periodically.

Wait, but how does this modulation compare to a planet transit in terms of the amplitude? Because the planet causes a dip when it's in front, but the spots cause a dip when they're facing us. But the problem states that the brightness variation due to the spots is being mistaken for a planet. So the amplitude of the dip from the spots should be the same as the dip from a planet. So we'll compare the two.

Let me think about the flux from the star. Normally, the star emits a certain amount of light. When there are spots, the total flux from the star is a bit different. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Each spot is cooler by 1000K.

So, the effective temperature of the star is 6000K. The spots are at 5000K. The flux from the entire star without spots would be sigma*Teff^4 * surface area.

But with spots, the flux is (100% - 20%) * sigma*(6000)^4 + 20% * sigma*(5000)^4. So F_total = 0.8 * sigma*(6000^4) + 0.2 * sigma*(5000^4).

Wait, but when the star rotates, a hemisphere with spots is presented to us. No, wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So when the star is viewed from Earth, either the spotted hemisphere is facing us completely, or the other side is. So the flux varies between the maximum and minimum
