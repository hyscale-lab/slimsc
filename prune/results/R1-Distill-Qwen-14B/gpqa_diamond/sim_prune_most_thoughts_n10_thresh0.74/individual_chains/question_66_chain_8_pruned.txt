Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible interactions (operators) consistent with the Standard Model gauge symmetry. Effective theories often include higher-dimensional operators that are not part of the renormalizable SM, but they still have to respect certain symmetries.

First, I think about Lorentz symmetry. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, right? So all its operators, including the effective ones in SMEFT, must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Then, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Wait, but in effective field theories, do we still require translational symmetry? Because EFTs often work in a low-energy limit where momenta are soft, but I'm not sure if Poincare is enforced. Or does the SMEFT framework automatically include it? Alternatively, maybe operators in SMEFT are written in a way that already respects Poincare symmetry. Hmm. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz plus translations? So if operators respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or not necessarily? Or perhaps in the SMEFT framework, the interactions are written in a way that already includes Poincare, so the operators must respect that.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the symmetries that SMEFT must have, regardless of the operators. Like, SMEFT as a theory must respect certain symmetries, so the operators must adhere to that. So, does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the Standard Model does, because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory. So SMEFT, being an effective theory built upon the SM, would also respect Poincare. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry (option 2). So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: when you write SMEFT operators, they must form a Lorentz-invariant theory. So each operator must be a Lorent
