Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about particles moving in a detector, and their Lorentz factors affecting how many reach the inner walls. 

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new and fast-decaying, traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Wait, so the first scenario has a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 20, and 1/3 reach the walls. The second scenario needs 2/3 to reach, so I guess I need to find the gamma that makes that happen.

I remember that the Lorentz factor affects the lifetime of the particles from our perspective. Oh wait, because these are fast-decaying particles, their lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. But how does that relate to the detector's radius?

So, the key here is probably the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls versus their lifetime. If the particles decay before they reach the walls, fewer will make it. So, if a particle's proper lifetime (tau) is such that gamma*tau is the lifetime as measured in the lab frame, then the time it takes to reach the wall must be less than gamma*tau for the particle to reach the detector.

Let me think. The time the particle takes to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. Since they are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So, time t = R / (beta * c), where beta is v/c, and R is the detector's radius.

Wait, but beta is related to gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). But for large gamma, beta is very close to 1, so R/(beta c) ≈ R/(c). Because beta is almost 1, the time is approximately R/(c).

Wait, but in the lab frame, the time the particle has before decaying is gamma times the proper lifetime tau. So, if the proper
