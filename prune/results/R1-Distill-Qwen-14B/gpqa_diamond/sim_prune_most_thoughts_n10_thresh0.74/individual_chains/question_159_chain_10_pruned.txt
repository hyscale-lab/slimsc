Okay, so I have this question about quasars and their spectra, and I need to figure out the comoving distance. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. But wait, at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops significantly. What does that mean? Oh right, I remember that quasars often show emission lines, and the peak in flux can be associated with something like the Lyman-alpha emission line. But wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. If we're seeing it at 790 nm, that's much longer. So that must be due to redshift—so the quasar is moving away from us, causing the wavelength to stretch.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the peak might be from another line. Let me think. Oh wait, the near-infrared peak could be from the Lyman-alpha line if it's redshifted. Alternatively, maybe it's another emission line. Let me think: for example, the Lyman series is in the UV, but when redshifted, it can move into optical or IR. So let's say the observed wavelength is 790 nm, which is much longer than the rest wavelength. So the quasar is at a high redshift.

The formula for redshift (z) is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So if the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), and observed is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. So z is about 5.5289, which is around z ≈5.53.

But wait, is the peak in the near-infrared and optical spectrum the Lyman-alpha line? Or could it be something else? Maybe the Balmer series? Let's think: the Balmer-alpha line is H-alpha at 656 nm. So if the observed peak is at 790, which is longer than 656, that would imply a redshift. So for H-alpha, the rest wavelength is 656 nm. Observed is 790, so z = (790/656
