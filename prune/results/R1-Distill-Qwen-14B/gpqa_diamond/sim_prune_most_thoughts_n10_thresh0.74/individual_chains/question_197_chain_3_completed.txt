Okay, I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by looking at the data given. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then determining the final product. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what X is first.

The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's analyze them step by step.

First, the IR data: the peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data now. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H). A broad peak around 10 ppm is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So that supports the IR data indicating a carbonyl and an -OH. So compound X might be a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but sometimes aldehydes can be around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually sharp singlets. The broadness here suggests it's more like a carboxylic acid proton. So maybe X is a substituted benzoic acid.

Next, the other NMR signals:

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the substituents are in the para position. For example, if we have a substituent in the para position, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. So, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene ring with an electron-withdrawing group because the downfield shift (8.0 ppm) is more likely for such groups. But wait, if it's a benzoic acid, the substituent is -COOH in the para position. But wait, the 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but that would not have a broad peak at 10.5; ketones don't have protons attached. So likely, X is a benzoic acid with substituents.

Wait, looking at the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – this could be adjacent to a carbonyl group, maybe a CH next to a carbonyl. Maybe part of a propyl chain or something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps adjacent to the CH group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH2CH3) or similar. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, perhaps from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: The NMR shows a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is a -COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm peak and the IR at 1720 cm-1, which aligns with a carboxylic acid carbonyl). Or wait, wait, another possibility: maybe it's an ester because the 1720 cm-1 could be an ester carbonyl. But the broad peak at 10.5 is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

So, if it's benzoic acid, the substituent is in para position. Then, the other substituent is a side chain. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a -CH- group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure: the benzene ring has a -COOH group in one para position, and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the other. Or perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group but with some branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, like a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl. So maybe the structure is something like:

Ph-COOH and another substituent, which is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)2? Wait, but the NMR shows 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a terminal methyl. So perhaps it's an ethyl group attached to a CH.

Let me try to reconstruct the structure. The NMR shows:

- A para-substituted benzene: two doublets, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. So substituents at para positions. One substituent is -COOH (giving the 10.5 ppm peak). The other is a side chain.

The other substituent would have:

A CH group (2.9 ppm, m), connected to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m), then a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm, d), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t). Wait, this might form a butyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is itself attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so that's a terminal CH2CH3 group. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Let me think. The structure could be:

Ph-COOH and another substituent at the para position, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to a methyl.

Wait, the substituent's structure: from the NMR, we have a CH group (2.9, m, 1H), which is connected to a CH2 (1.7, m, 2H), then a CH(CH3) (1.4, d, 3H), and finally a CH2CH3 (0.9, t, 3H). So this might be a chain like CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make it a pentyl group, but the integration doesn't add up. Let me count the integrations:

The CH group is 1H, so maybe it's a substituent like -(CH2)1-CH(CH2CH3)- something. Hmm, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, let's think about the groups:

The CH at 2.9 ppm is next to a CH2 group (1.7 ppm). Then, a CH(CH3) is at 1.4 ppm, and a CH2CH3 is at 0.9 ppm. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Or maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, maybe it's a butyl group. Let me see, the substituent is probably a propyl group or butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group.

Wait, an isobutyl group would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. Let me see. A isobutyl group would have a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- structure? No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure of isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, no, the isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So it's a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, so that suggests a -CH2CH2CH3 group, but the other signals don't fit that perfectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3 group. That would be a pentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, the CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H) is probably a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Let me think about the substituent.

Wait, if it's a benzene ring with -COOH in one para position and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group in the other para position, then looking at the NMR:

The CH2 group attached to the ring would be at 2.9 ppm (1H), but wait, CH2 groups typically show up as doublets. But here, it's a multiplet. Hmm, maybe it's a CH group attached to another CH2.

Wait, another approach: let's try to find the structure of compound X.

We have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is a COOH group, and the other is a side chain.

The side chain has the following groups: a CH group (1H at 2.9), a CH2 (2H at 1.7), a CH(CH3) (3H at 1.4 as a doublet), and a CH2CH3 (3H at 0.9 as triplet). So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)?

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, let's think about the substituent structure. Let me try to build it step by step.

The substituent is connected to the benzene ring. The first carbon after the ring is a CH (2.9 ppm). This CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm). The CH2 is connected to a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm), and that's connected to a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

So the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)?

No, wait, that's not possible because each bond can have only one substituent.

Alternatively, the substituent could be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but then the CH2 groups would have more hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group or something else.

Wait, let me count the hydrogens. The CH at 2.9 has 1H. The CH2 at 1.7 has 2H. The CH(CH3) at 1.4 has 3H (so it's a CH with a methyl group). The CH2CH3 has 3H.

So the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)-CH2CH3)? No, that doesn't seem to make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Wait, maybe it's a isopropyl group. No, because isopropyl would have a CH(CH3)2, but then the next groups don't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2-CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a propyl group, but with a branching on the second carbon. Like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would make the structure longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would lead the CH to have more hydrogens.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. But the NMR doesn't seem to match that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the substituent groups again.

The substituent is connected to the benzene ring. The first carbon (attached to the ring) is a CH, which is then connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH3.

So the substituent would be: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, that would make it a four-carbon substituent but the integration doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch. Let me see:

If the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group, then the NMR would show a CH2 next to the ring, which would be split into a triplet or quartet. But in the NMR, the CH is at 2.9, which is a multiplet. So maybe it's a secondary CH (like a CH connected to two other carbons).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should write down the structure possibilities.

Another approach: the presence of a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid. So the compound X is a benzoic acid derivative with a substituent in the para position, which is an isobutyl group or something similar.

Wait, the options given include benzoic acids and other compounds. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So options A and C are benzoic acids with substituents, while option D is a substituted toluene.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5, which is a carboxylic acid, so options D and B (if B were a benzoic acid) would not fit, but looking at the options, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative, not a benzoic acid, so it would not have the carboxylic proton. So perhaps X is either option A or C.

Now, looking back at the NMR data, the substituent should be in the para position. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, that would fit option C.

Wait, what's the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid? The benzene ring has a -COOH group in position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group in position 1? Wait, no. Wait, the numbering would be such that the COOH is in position 4, so the substituent would be in position 1, but that's probably the same as para, but I might be getting that wrong.

Alternatively, the substituents are in para positions. So if there's a COOH in position 1, the substituent would be in position 4.

Wait, the NMR shows a para-substituted benzene, so the two substituents are opposite each other. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituents would be a COOH and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

What's the structure of a sec-butyl group? It's a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3). Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. The butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Primary butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH2-

Secondary butyl: -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that would be a branch on the second carbon, making it a secondary butyl group, or is that a tertiary? Wait, the butyl group would have four carbons. The secondary would have the branch on the second carbon. So the structure would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that can't be right because that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the butyl group is four carbons. So the substituent would be:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, that's actually a pentyl group. No, butyl is four carbons. So the substituent is:

For a sec-butyl group, it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait no, perhaps it's -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent is connected to the benzene ring as a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. But that would be a butyl group where the substituent is on the second carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. So, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, let me think about the substituent as a isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2.

But the NMR data shows a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm, 2H), then a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm, 3H), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, 3H).

So the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)CH2CH3) ?

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group?

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group. Let me see.

Another approach: let's draw the substituent. The NMR shows the substituent has a CH group (1H, 2.9), then a CH2 (2H, 1.7), then a CH(CH3) (1H, 1.4 d), and a CH2CH3 (3H, 0.9 t).

So substituent structure: the benzene ring is connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to a CH2CH3. So the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, that can't be because CH(CH3) would already be a CH, so perhaps it's a chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CH(CH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about what reaction is happening when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, another possibility is the conversion of a benzyl chloride to a benzyl alcohol, but that's with HI and P. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Another reaction: when a benzene ring has a substituent with a leaving group, perhaps like a tosyl group, and reacts with HI, it undergoes alkylation. But in this case, X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which might be a way to perform a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzylic bromide or chloride, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is known to be a way to prepare arsine, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for the hydrolysis of certain groups.

Wait, but in the case of a benzyl chloride, reacting with HI and red phosphorus can lead to the formation of a benzyl iodide. But that's when you have a good leaving group. If X has a good leaving group attached to the benzyl position, then the reaction with HI would substitute it with an iodide.

But in this case, the NMR of X shows a carboxylic acid proton, so perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative. So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, another possibility: if X is a nitrile, the IR would show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here. So X isn't a nitrile.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. Could it be an ester? The presence of a broad peak at 10.5 suggests a carboxylic acid, though. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but then the NMR wouldn't have a proton around 10.5.

So I think X is a benzoic acid. So when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Hmm, another thought: perhaps X is a benzyl ester and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide or chloride, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus converts it into a benzyl iodide, but that's only if X is an alkyl halide.

But the NMR doesn't suggest an alkyl halide. Instead, the NMR suggests a benzoic acid with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is elimination. But I'm not sure.

Let me think of the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI is often used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But if X is a nitrile, then the IR would have a peak around 2200, which isn't present. So that's probably not it.

Another possibility: if X is an acid chloride, then red phosphorus and HI might lead to some reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ester, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the IR of X shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or a carboxylic acid. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak is around 1700 cm-1, but it can vary. However, the broad peak at 10.5 suggests a carboxylic acid.

So if X is a benzoic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's a substitution reaction if X has a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not directly on the acid but on another part of the molecule.

Wait, maybe X isn't a benzoic acid. Perhaps the IR is showing an ester carbonyl. So if the 1720 peak is an ester, then the 10.5 ppm peak might not be a carboxylic acid. But what else could it be? An aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but it's usually a sharp singlet. The broadness here suggests it's an -OH group, like a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol, but the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I think X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options again and see which one fits the data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3). Let me see the NMR of that.

The sec-butyl group would have the following protons:

- The CH2 next to the ring: this would be a triplet (since it's connected to the CH(CH3)), but in the NMR, we have a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) which is a CH group, not a CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure:

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no, wait. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that's not right. Let's clarify:

The butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH3 (primary), -CH2CH(CH2CH3) (secondary?), or perhaps -(CH2)2CH(CH3) (tertiary?).

Wait, the IUPAC name for the substituent in option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. The correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that's a four-carbon chain with the branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, that can't be right because that would be a five-carbon chain. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, making it a secondary substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So the substituent is a butyl group with the branch on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR of the substituent would have:

- The CH group attached to the benzene (Ph-CH-) would show up as a triplet or quartet, but in our NMR, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H). Then the next CH2 (from CH2CH(CH3)) would show up around 1.7 ppm as a quartet or something else, but the NMR shows 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). Then, the CH(CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Hmm, this seems to fit. So the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but the substituent is supposed to be a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Then, the NMR would show the -CH2- as a triplet, but the data shows a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that would be a four-carbon chain, making it a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. That would be a propyl group attached to a CH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But in that case, the NMR would show a CH2 group attached to the ring, which is then connected to a CH that is connected to two methyl groups.

But in the NMR, we have a CH (2.9 ppm, 1H), which would correspond to the CH in the isobutyl group. Then, the CH2 groups would come after. Wait, but the isobutyl group's CH is connected to two methyl groups, so the protons on the CH would split into a septet, but in our case, it's a multiplet, which might fit.

Wait, but the isobutyl group's protons would be: the CH2 group attached to the ring would be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH), and the CH would be a septet (from the two adjacent CH3 groups). But in our NMR, we have a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a single CH, then a CH2 at 1.7 (2H), then a CH(CH3) at 1.4 (3H), and a CH2CH3 at 0.9 (3H).

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3 group. But that would make it a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the options given.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-?

No, that would be a tertiary butyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me clarify:

- A primary alkyl group has the leaving group on the first carbon.
- A secondary has it on the second carbon (branch).
- Tertiary has it on the third.

So a sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group with the branch on the second carbon, making it a secondary substituent.

So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But wait, that would be a butyl group with the branch on the second carbon, so it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but that gives five carbons if attached to the benzene ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Another approach: perhaps it's better to construct the structure based on the NMR data.

The substituent has:

- A CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H).
- A CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (2H).
- A CH(CH3) at 1.4 ppm (3H).
- A CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (3H).

So the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch. The CH at 2.9 is attached to the benzene ring. Then, the CH2 (1.7) is attached to it. Then, the CH(CH3) (1.4) is attached to the CH2, and finally, the CH2CH3 (0.9) is attached to that.

So the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- ?

Wait, no, that would be a five-carbon chain, but we have four carbons (including the one attached to the ring).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would give a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an isobutyl group. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group again.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a cyclopropane ring, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, which would make it a propyl group with a branch on the second carbon. Then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the ring (Ph-CH2-) would be split into a triplet, but in the NMR, the first group is a CH (2.9 ppm, 1H), which is probably not a CH2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then the CH would be at 2.9 ppm, and the CH2CH2CH3 would have their own signals. But that would require the substituent to be a longer chain.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the reaction again. X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What's the outcome?

Red phosphorus and HI is a classic reagent for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, it can be used in the Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes. Another possibility is that if X is a benzyl halide, reacting with HI would substitute the halide with iodide.

But in this case, since the NMR of X suggests a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the acid group but reacts elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: if X has an ester group, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the initial compound would be an ester, and the product would be a carboxylic acid. However, looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, what would X be?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with an ester group and a substituent, and the reaction converts the ester to a carboxylic acid, producing a benzoic acid derivative.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but I don't think HI and red phosphorus are used for that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride or bromide, and the reaction with HI and red phosphorus converts it into a benzyl iodide. But that doesn't align with the NMR data showing a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a good leaving group, and the reaction substitutes it with iodide. But the NMR doesn't suggest such groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage reaction. For example, if X has a tosyl group, the reaction with HI would replace it with iodide.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzoic acid group and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The NMR of option C would have:

- The benzene protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H), which matches the given data.

- The substituent's protons: the sec-butyl group would have a CH2 next to the ring (appearing around δ 2.5-3.0 as a triplet), then a CH(CH3) (as a triplet or something), and the terminal CH2CH3 as a triplet around δ 1.2-1.4.

Wait, but according to the given data, the substituent's protons are at 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). So the substituent's protons don't exactly match a sec-butyl group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me imagine the structure:

Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. But that would give a CH group at the ring, which is attached to a CH2CH2CH3 group. The NMR would have the CH as a triplet, but in the data it's a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3 group. So the structure would be Ph-CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch on the first carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH attached to the ring (Ph-CH-) as a septet (since it's connected to two CH2 groups), but in the data, it's a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which is a tertiary butyl group. But that would have a different NMR pattern.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each option's structure and see which one matches the NMR and IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: benzene ring with -COOH in position 4 and a sec-butyl group in position 1. The substituents are para.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, that would be five carbons. No, wait, a butyl group has four carbons. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, that's four carbons, but I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would be a secondary butyl group.

In that case, the protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (δ around 2.5-3, triplet), then the CH(CH2CH3) (δ around 1.5-1.8, triplet), and the CH2CH3 (δ around 0.9-1.1, triplet).

But in the given data, the substituent's protons are at 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

Wait, the CH2 attached to the ring would be next to a CH(CH2CH3), so the CH2 would be a triplet. But in the data, the first substituent proton is a multiplet (m) at 2.9 ppm, which is a CH group, not a CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Then, the CH2 groups would be next to each other, leading to more complex splitting.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: let me think about the integration.

The benzene ring's substituents account for 4H (two doublets, 2H each). The substituent has 1H (CH), 2H (CH2), 3H (CH(CH3)), and 3H (CH2CH3). So the substituent is a four-carbon group (1+2+3+3=9 H?), but that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring, so the substituent itself must have a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9 H? That can't be right because the substituent is only a butyl group, which should have 9 H? Wait, no, a butyl group has four carbons. For example, a straight butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH3, which has 9 H (each CH2 has 2 H, and the terminal CH3 has 3 H). But with branching, the number of H changes.

Wait, the substituent in X has:

- 1H (CH at 2.9)
- 2H (CH2 at 1.7)
- 3H (CH(CH3) at 1.4)
- 3H (CH2CH3 at 0.9)

So total substituent H is 1+2+3+3 = 9 H. That would be a four-carbon substituent (since 9 H would come from four carbons: 1 (CH) + 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH(CH3)) + 3 (CH2CH3) = wait, but that sums to more than four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a three-carbon group. No, because 1+2+3+3 = 9 H, which is too much for a three-carbon group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is a propyl group attached to a CH. That would give:

- CH (1H, triplet)
- CH2 (2H, triplet)
- CH2 (2H, triplet)
- CH3 (3H, triplet)

But the NMR data doesn't show triplet for the CH2 groups.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should focus on the reaction and the options.

The reaction is X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Let's think about what each option would do.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is option C, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Would it stay the same or change?

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the carboxylic acid. But the options don't include an ester.

Another possibility: perhaps X is a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI becomes a carboxylic acid. But the NMR doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide derivative, and the reaction substitutes the bromide with iodide, but the product would be a benzyl iodide, which isn't among the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. For instance, if X has a good leaving group, like a tosyl group, then HI would substitute it with iodide. But the options don't include such products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if X is a benzene ring with a substituent that can be deprotonated, perhaps the reaction does something else.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from a carboxylic acid, but that's done with SOCl2, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine, but that's done with different reagents.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is a four-carbon group with a branching. The IR supports this. So the compound X is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Now, what would happen when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

I'm trying to recall reactions involving red phosphorus and HI. One reaction I remember is the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But X is already a carboxylic acid, so that's not applicable.

Wait, another reaction: red phosphorus can be used in the presence of HI to effect the substitution of a tosyl group with iodide. But X doesn't have a tosyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide, and the reaction converts it to benzyl iodide. But the options don't include a benzyl iodide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Another thought: perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a good leaving group, like a bromide. Then, the reaction would substitute it with iodide. For example, if X is 4-bromophenylbenzoic acid, the reaction would produce 4-iodophenylbenzoic acid. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of a benzyl chloride to form a benzyl iodide. But again, the options don't reflect that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the reaction part. Maybe I should think about the options' structures and the reaction.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If X is option C, what would happen upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI? Not sure, but perhaps nothing, as it's already a carboxylic acid. But that can't be right because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't option C but another structure. Let me think again about the NMR.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring, which is consistent.

The NMR also shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is the -COOH proton. So X is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

The substituent's NMR signals are:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone, but no, X has a benzene ring. So maybe a CH adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): probably a CH2 next to a CH group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3.

Putting it together, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group? But that would be a pentyl group, which doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isoamyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

But in that case, the NMR would have a CH2 group next to the ring, which would be a triplet.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, maybe it's an isopropyl group. But an isopropyl group would have a CH(CH3)2, which would show up as a singlet. But in this case, the substituent's protons are more complex.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group, which is a isobutyl group. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But again, I'm getting stuck.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR matches a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that has a CH, CH2, CH(CH3), and CH2CH3 groups.


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction between compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the given IR and NMR data. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an -OH group), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl, likely a carboxylic acid), 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (consistent with a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) (indicating a para-substituted benzene ring), and signals for a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH(CH₃) group (1.4 ppm, 3H), and a CH₂CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, 3H). These signals suggest a side chain with a CH, CH₂, CH(CH₃), and CH₂CH₃ groups attached to the benzene ring.

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is not explicitly detailed, but it is likely a substitution or transformation involving the substituent on the benzene ring. Based on the NMR and IR data, compound X is identified as a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. This matches the structure of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The final product is therefore 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Answer: C
