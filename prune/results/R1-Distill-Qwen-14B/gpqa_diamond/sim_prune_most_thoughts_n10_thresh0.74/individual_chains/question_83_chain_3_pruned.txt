Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

First, I need to figure out what the diluted acetic acid concentration is. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the volume. So, initially, there's 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water. The total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. Plugging in, M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. At 25% titration, how much NaOH have we added? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.

The moles of acetic acid initially: volume in liters is 0.04 L, so moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, at equivalence, they neutralize each other to form acetate.

So, for the equivalence point, the solution will be a buffer of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate solution. But wait, first I need to find the concentration of sodium acetate. The moles of NaOH at equivalence will be equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since the total volume is the sum of the diluted acetic acid and the NaOH added. Wait, but how much volume NaOH is added at equivalence?

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (after dilution). The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. The moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. So, the volume of NaOH at equivalence is V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total volume at equivalence is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

The concentration of sodium acetate is moles / volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so its solution is basic. The pH can be found using the Kb of acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The acetate ion (A-) will hydrolyze in water: A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. The Kb is 5.405e-10. Since the concentration is 0.02 M, we can set up the equation:

Kb = [HA][OH-] / [A-] ≈ (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small.

So, x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is about 1.04e-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. Wait, maybe I made a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula for weak base solutions. Maybe the approximation isn't valid here.

The Kb is 5.405e-10, concentration is 0.02 M.

So, Kb = x²/(0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02)

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5 as before.

So the OH- is ~1.04e-5, pOH ~4.98, pH ~9.02. But looking at the options, the equivalence pH values are lower. Hmm. Maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the concentration? Let me check again. The initial acetic acid was 0.025 M in 40 cm³. Equivalence requires adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles of NaOH: 0.01 L * 0.1 M = 0.001 mol, which is correct. So the final volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So sodium acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Wait, but at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is just sodium acetate. So maybe I should consider the hydrolysis of acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate it using the formula:

pH = pKa' + log([A-]/[HA])

But since it's the equivalence point, [A-] is 0.02 M, and [HA] is zero, which isn't helpful. Wait, no, because in reality, you have to consider the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. So maybe using the Kb is the right way.

But the options don't have a pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps at the equivalence point, I should have considered the solution being a buffer where the concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Let me try using the formula for a weak base again.

But maybe the calculation is correct, and the options are wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the 25% titration point first. Maybe that will give me some insight.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH added are 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

So the moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, we have a buffer solution with:

Moles of acetic acid (HA) = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion (A-) = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is
