Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Feynman diagrams and loop integrals in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a scribbled note next to it. The note has some terms: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. They want to know how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, I remember that in Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the topology of the diagram. Each loop contributes a certain factor to the amplitude calculation, especially when you're doing perturbation theory.

The term that comes into play here is the loop integral. I think the general form for a loop integral in a Feynman diagram involves factors of 1/(16 pi²), because each loop typically brings in a 1/(4 pi)^2 term from integrating over the loop momentum in four-dimensional spacetime. But wait, that's for a single loop. So each loop would add a factor of 1/(4 pi)^2.

Looking at the given terms, I see 1/(4 pi)^6. Let me count how many times that appears. It's 1 over (4 pi)^6, which is (1/(4 pi)) raised to the 6th power. Since each loop brings in a (1/(4 pi))² factor, how many loops would that be? Let's calculate: each loop is 2 in the exponent. So 6 divided by 2 is 3 loops. Oh, so the (4 pi)^6 term suggests 3 loops because each loop contributes a factor to the 4 pi in the denominator.

Wait, but wait. Another point: the overall scaling with loops. For a Feynman diagram with L loops, the amplitude typically has a factor of (loop integral)^L. But wait, the loop integral itself is roughly 1/(16 pi²) per loop. So for L loops, it would be (1/(16 pi²))^L, which is the same as (1/(4 pi))^2L. So in the given expression, (1/(4 pi))^6 would imply 2L =6, so L=3. That makes sense.

Let me look at the other terms to see if they support
