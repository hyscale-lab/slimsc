Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured the spin many times on identical systems. 

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, I'm a bit confused about how that's written. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the spin state is usually a two-component vector. So the state vector here is probably χ = [3i, 4]^T, meaning the first component is 3i and the second is 4. 

The Pauli matrices are involved here. Oh right, S_y is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix. So sigma_y is the matrix:
[0, -i;
i, 0]

Wait, so S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by S_y and then multiplied by the state vector again. So mathematically, it's ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. 

Let me write that down. So first, I need to compute the conjugate transpose of χ. Since χ is [3i, 4]^T, the conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3. Wait, no—wait, 3i is already a purely imaginary number. The conjugate
