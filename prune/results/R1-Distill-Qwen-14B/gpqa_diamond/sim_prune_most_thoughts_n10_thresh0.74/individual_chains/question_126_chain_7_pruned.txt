Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will observe in each.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the products of each reaction are. Let's start with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) and then acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Hexan-3-one is a ketone at position 3. So, when reduced, it becomes hexan-3-ol.

But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me think: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2 in the middle. The structure is CH2CH2 with the ketone at C3.

Wait, the structure is CH2CH2CH2... Let me write it out.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-(C=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3. But with a methoxy group at position 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2- C(=O) - CH2 - CH(OCH3) - CH2.

Wait, hexan-3-one has six carbons, with the ketone at C3.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)2-CH3. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, that's hexan-3-one, right? So for 5-methoxy, the substituent is on carbon 5. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the molecule is (S) configuration at C5.

When we reduce this with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, the ketone (C3) will be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, LAH usually reduces
