Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about identifying genes contributing to resistance in white lupine against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and also double mutants. The experiment tested the resistance of these mutants to the pathogen.

The key points from the setup are:
- At least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.
- They tested each mutant and double mutants for their resistance levels.

The results are:
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0% resistance
- g1g2: 0% resistance

And the question is about the interactions between these genes. The options are A to D, each making different claims about which is the transcription factor, if there's pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

Hmm, I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic interactions, the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So epistasis is about the relationship between genes where the expression of one gene affects the phenotype of another. Also, redundancy could mean that the two genes have the same function, so knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype beyond what one knockout shows.

Wait, but looking at the results, the single mutants: g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. G2's knockout is completely susceptible, meaning it's necessary for resistance. Then, the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) all have 0% resistance. That suggests that when both G2 and another gene are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as the worse of the two. But wait, let's think.

In g1g2, both are mutants. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of others, then G1's function might be downstream of G2. But if G2 is the transcription factor, then in the g2 mutant, all downstream genes (including G1 and G3) wouldn't be expressed. That would explain why g2 is 0% because without G2, the downstream genes aren't working, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but for the double mutants: when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' knockouts don't change the resistance. Because in g2g1 (same as g1g2?), the resistance is 0% which is same as g2. So the presence of the g2 mutation masks the effect of the other mutations. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. Because epistasis is when the effect of one gene (epistatic) masks the effect of another (hypostatic). So if G2 is epistatic, then whether G1 or G3 is present doesn't matter because without G2, the system isn't working.

So, looking at the options, which ones say that G2 is a transcription factor and is epistatic? Let's check the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. Wait, but our analysis suggests G2 is the TF. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm, same promoter might mean they're in the same pathway or something. But I'm not sure about that.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene
