Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, do the masses matter here? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant unless it affects the abundance somehow. But I think the key here is the elemental abundance data given using the EW method under LTE.

The given data for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Wait, what do these brackets mean again? Oh right, the square brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to the Sun. The notation [A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B) - log10(n_A/n_B)_Sun. So a positive value means A is more abundant relative to B than in the Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. And 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, how does that work? Let me compute those.

For the Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 ≈ 1e-5.

So in the Sun, the ratio of Mg to Fe would be (nMg/nH)/(nFe/nH) = (1e-5)/(3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316. So [Mg/Fe]_Sun is log10(0.316) ≈ -0.5. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of solar ratios for the stars.

The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

Hmm, but how to get that.

Let me think about each star's abundances.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_Sun = 0.3.

Wait, but what's the solar [Si/Fe]?

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log(nFe/H)= -4.5.

But I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe], but I can
