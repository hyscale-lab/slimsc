Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The problem is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are A to D, each with different units.

Hmm. So first, I remember that the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. When the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the lab here being the Bubble Chamber) will be longer due to time dilation.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) or equivalently (E)/(m c²) since for a relativistic particle, energy E is related to gamma via E = γ m c². Wait, but I'm not sure about that; maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, the problem gives the energy of X⁰ as 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV. So the energy E is 27 GeV, mass m is 3.41 GeV.

So gamma would be E/(m c²). But since we're working in units where c=1 (like in particle physics), E in GeV and m in GeV, so gamma = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see: 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87. 3.41 * 8 is 27.28. So 8 times would get us to 27.28 GeV, which is slightly more than 27 GeV. So gamma is approximately 7.91 or about 8. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 = 27.28. So 27 is 27.28 - 27 = 0.28 less than 8 times. So 27 /3.41 = 7.91495... yeah, approximately 7.915.

So gamma is about 7.915.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀ = 7.915 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's calculate that.

7.915 * 8 = 63.32, so 63.32e-16 seconds. That's 6.332e-15 seconds. Wait, no: 7.915 *8 is 63.32, so τ is 63.32e-16 seconds, which is 6.332e-15 seconds, right? Wait, no, 8e-16 * 7.915: 8 *7.915 =63.32, so 63.32e-16 s = 6.332e-15 s?

Wait, 63.32e-16 is 6.332e-15, yes.

Now, the time the particle exists in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. But what's the formula for the minimum resolution needed?

Wait, the particle's lifetime determines how far it travels before decaying. The length L is c * τ, but wait, wait. Because the lifetime is longer, the particle will move further before decaying. The proper lifetime is τ₀, so without time dilation, it would only live for τ₀. But in reality, it lives longer, so the lab frame sees it moving a longer distance.

But wait, for the decay products to be observed, the decay must occur within the detector. So the minimum resolution is the minimum distance over which the decay can be observed. So the distance the particle travels is L = v * τ, but since τ is gamma tau0, L = v gamma tau0.

But v can be approximated from the energy. Alternatively, since gamma is about 7.915, beta (v/c) would be sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, beta is v/c. So beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma squared). Let me compute that.

gamma is approximately 7.915. So 1/gamma² is about 1/(62.64) ≈ 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 is 0.984, so sqrt(0.984) is about 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, so v = (p c²)/(E) ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the velocity. Since beta = v/c, and gamma = 7.915, then beta can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

Let me compute beta:

gamma = 7.915 → gamma² = approx 62.64.

So 1 - beta² = 1 / gamma² → beta² = 1 - (1/62.64) = (62.64-1)/62.64 ≈ 61.64/62.64 ≈ 0.9839. So beta = sqrt(0.9839) ≈ 0.9919. So about 0.992c.

So v ≈ 0.992 * c. But I'm not sure if I need to calculate this. Because if I can find the length, perhaps I can proceed without explicitly calculating v.

Wait, another approach: the average decay length is L = c * beta * gamma * tau0.

Because, the proper lifetime is tau0, so in the lab frame, lifetime is gamma tau0, and the distance L is v * (gamma tau0) = beta c gamma tau0.

So L = beta gamma c tau0.

We can compute that.

But the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. So perhaps we're looking for the minimum distance that allows us to detect 30% of the particles decaying, meaning the detection must be able to capture a certain fraction of the decay products.

Wait, wait. The minimum resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products. So the decay occurs at a point, but due to the particle's lifetime, the decay products may spread out over a certain distance. The resolution of the detector needs to be good enough to see the decay products as a single point, not spread too much.

Wait, but the problem might be about the minimum separation needed between the interaction point and the decay point so that the decay can be observed as a separate point, rather than being too close. So the minimum distance that the decay can occur from the vertex is determined by the decay length.

But I think the problem is more about the minimum resolution (angular or spatial) required to observe the decay. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the minimum distance the decay products travel so that they can be detected as a separate track.

Wait, another approach: the decay occurs at some point, but the decay products (Y and Z) will have their own velocities. The minimum resolution is the distance over which the decay products can be detected. So if the decay occurs too close, the tracks would be too close to resolve.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum possible distance that the decay could be observed. Because, the decay can only be observed if it happens within a certain distance from the original point, so the detector's resolution needs to be at least that.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the question is saying. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, perhaps this relates to the fraction of decays that occur within a certain distance, which the detector's resolution must be able to distinguish. So, the minimum resolution would correspond to the distance at which 30% of the decays have occurred.

Wait, but in reality, the decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability of decay within a certain distance depends on the decay length.

The decay probability as a function of time is P(t) = 1 - exp(-t/tau). But since the particle is moving at velocity v, the time t is related to the distance L by t = L/(v). So the probability of decay within distance L is P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/(c tau)).

Wait, but tau is
