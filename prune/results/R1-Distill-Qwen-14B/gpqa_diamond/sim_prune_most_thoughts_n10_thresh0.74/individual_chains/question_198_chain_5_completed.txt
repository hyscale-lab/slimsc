Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about cobalt complexes and stability constants, right? Hmm.

So, the problem says we've got a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate is 0.1 M. The stability constants, which are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. They’re asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's a measure of the stability of a complex. A higher β means the complex is more stable. Each β corresponds to a different complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for the second, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

But wait, the cobalt ion is Co^2+. So when thiocyanate (SCN^-) binds, each SCN adds a negative charge. So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) *1 = +1). Second would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. The third would be [Co(SCN)_3]^−, and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. Oh, but wait the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, wait, but β4 is lower than β1. That might mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the first. Interesting. That could complicate things.

The question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, the one with two SCN ligands. So the species in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. We need to find what percentage this species is of all cobalt species.

So the approach is to calculate the distribution of all possible cobalt species and then find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The general approach for such problems involves using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal to find the fraction of each complex. The formula for the fraction of a particular complex is given by the product of the stability constant for that complex and the appropriate power of the ligand concentration, divided by the sum of all such terms for each possible complex.

Wait, the formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n * [L]^n) / Σ(β_k * [L]^k) for k from 0 to 4.

Wait no, wait. The stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise formation constants. Hmm, but wait, the given β's are the overall stability constants, I think. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

So the species are:

Co^2+ (n=0),

[Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1),

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2),

[Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3),

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4).

Each of these has a different stability constant β1, β2, etc.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all these species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

But since the solution is at equilibrium, each species' concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ concentration and the ligand concentration, using the stability constants.

Wait, let me think. For each complex, [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = β_n × [Co^2+] × [SCN^-]^n.

So substituting each into the total cobalt concentration:

c_total = [Co^2+] × [1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ].

So, [Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ).

But in this problem, the total cobalt concentration c_total is given as 1e-2 M. Wait, but I think c(Co) is the sum of all species, so [Co^2+] isn't given directly.

Wait, let me get this straight. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the complex species. So:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2−.

Each of these can be written in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n × [Co^2+] × [SCN^-]^n.

So substituting,

c_total = [Co^2+] × (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

Therefore,

[Co^2+] = c_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4).

Once we have [Co^2+], we can find each species' concentration, and thus the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, but our goal is to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So the plan is:

1. Compute the denominator, which is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

2. Then, [Co^2+] = c_total / denominator.

3. Then, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2.

4. The fraction f_2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / c_total.

But wait, to get the percentage, we can compute the fraction of that species.

Alternatively, the fraction is (β2 [SCN]^2) / (denominator) divided by c_total/c_total, which just leaves (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator) * 100%.

Wait, let me think about that. Because c_total is [Co^2+] multiplied by the denominator, so [Co^2+] = c_total / denominator.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN]^2 = β2 (c_total / denominator) [SCN]^2.

The fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / c_total = (β2 [SCN]^2 / denominator) * (c_total / c_total) ) = (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

Because c_total cancels out.

So the fraction f_2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

So denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

So let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So [SCN] = 0.1.

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

β3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

β4 [SCN]^4 =16 * (0.1)^4 =16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Now sum all terms:

1 (from n=0) + 0.9 (n=1) + 0.4 (n=2) + 0.063 (n=3) + 0.0016 (n=4) =

Let me add them:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator = approximately 2.3646.

Then, the fraction f_2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

β2 [SCN]^2 is 0.4.

So f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%.

Wait, but wait. The options include D)16.9%. That would be the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex.

Wait, but the options say the blue dithiocyanato is which complex? Wait, I think I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is blue. So the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Compute denominator:

β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9

+0.4=2.3

+0.063=2.363

+0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, f_2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

So answer option D is 16.9%, which would be the correct answer.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants are:

- β₁ = 9 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺),  
- β₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^0),  
- β₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]⁻),  
- β₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]²⁻).  

The total cobalt concentration is given as \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, \( f_2 \), is calculated as:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
\begin{align*}
\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] &= 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \\
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 &= 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4, \\
\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 &= 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \\
\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 &= 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing all terms:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction \( f_2 \)
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
\[
f_2 \times 100\% = 0.169 \times 100\% = 16.9\%.
\]

Thus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
