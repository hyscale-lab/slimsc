Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. I'll start by reading the question carefully and then try to piece together the reactions and the possible compounds involved.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions with various substances labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E.

First, let's list out what we know from the problem:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and produces two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. The product is bright red. Red products often make me think of things like copper compounds, maybe copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but that's blue. Alternatively, maybe something like lead dioxide (PbO2) which is dark brown. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a transition metal sulfide or oxide. Oh, wait, another possibility is a nitro compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide or sulfate.

Looking at the next reaction: C + 2 D → E, extremely hazardous. That makes me think E could be something like a toxic gas or a strong acid. Wait, but E is a product of C and D. Let's think about what D could be. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, maybe something else. But wait, D reacting with B to form H. 

Wait, if H is a solvent, and D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps D is an acid or a base. For example, if B is a metal, D could be an acid. Let's think: if B is a gas, possible gaseous metals are maybe H2, O2, but more likely, B is a non-metal. Wait, wait, gas B reacts with solid A. So solid A plus gas B forms C. Let me think of a typical reaction where a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between a metal and a halogen gas. For example, copper (solid) reacting with chlorine gas (Cl2) would form CuCl2, but that's blue. Alternatively, maybe it's lead reacting with something. Or perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong and weak acids commonly include HCl (strong), H2SO4 (strong?), HNO3, and for weak, maybe H3PO4 or CH3COOH. But considering F and G would be produced from the hydrolysis of C, perhaps C is
