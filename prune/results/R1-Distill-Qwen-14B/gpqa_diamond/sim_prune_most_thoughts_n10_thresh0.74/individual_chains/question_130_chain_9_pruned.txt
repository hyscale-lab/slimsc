Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, right, I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when this line is redshifted, its wavelength increases.

Wait, ground-based optical telescopes can't observe ultraviolet light because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs it. So any light that's shifted into the optical range would be what we can see. So the Lyman-alpha line, which is originally at about 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm), needs to be redshifted into the optical range, which is longer than about 400 nm (violet) up to maybe 700 nm (red). Or wait, optical telescopes can detect visible light, which is roughly 400-700 nm.

So the key here is that the Lyman-alpha absorption must be shifted into the visible range. So the rest wavelength λ0 is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed wavelength λ must be greater than or equal to the lower limit of the optical range, say around 400 nm. But I think some sources might consider the optical range starting at 300 nm or so, but maybe 400 is a safer lower limit.

Wait, actually, the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths much below about 300 nm (far ultraviolet), so ground-based telescopes can't see below that. So the Lyman-alpha line, after redshifting, must be visible in the optical, which starts around 300 nm or higher. So the observed wavelength λ must be ≥ 300 nm.

So the redshift z is calculated using the formula z = (λ - λ0) / λ0.

We can rearrange this to find z: z = (λ / λ0) - 1.

We want the minimal z such that λ is just entering the observable range. So the minimal λ would be the lower limit of the optical. Let's take λ = 300 nm. Wait, but wait: 300 nm is still in the near-ultraviolet. So maybe the optical starts at 400 nm? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question uses the Lyman break, which is the transition from Lyman series to longer wavelengths. The Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm. So after a certain redshift, the Lyman-alpha emission (or absorption) moves into the observed frame.

Wait, but the problem is about absorption. So quasars emit light, and if there's a cloud of neutral hydrogen at a certain redshift, it absorbs the quasar's light at the Lyman-alpha wavelength. So the absorption line is observed at λ = (1 + z) * λ0.

So for ground-based optical telescopes, they can't observe wavelengths below about 300
