Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, so first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. I should probably list them all and calculate the energy for each.

Let me list all possible states. I'll denote each state as (S1, S2, S3):

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now for each state, I need to compute E. Let's compute the term inside the energy for each state.

The energy E is -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

1. State 1: All +1s.
   S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State 2: S3 is -1, others +1.
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. State 3: S2 is -1, others +1.
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. State 4: S2 and S3 are -1, S1 is +1.
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

5. State 5: S1 is -1, others +1.
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

6. State 6: S1 and S3 are -1, S2 is +1.
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

7. State7: S1 and S2 are -1, S3 is +1.
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

8. State8: All -1s.
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check a couple of these. For state 2: S3 is -1. So S1S2 is 1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E is J. That makes sense.

Similarly, for state 3: S2 is -1. S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So E is J. Correct.

State4: S2 and S3 are -1. So S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is -1 (S1 is +1, S3 is -1), S2S3 is (+1) because both are -1. So sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So E= J. Right.

Same for state5: S1 is -1, S2 and S3 +1. S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is 1. Sum is -1 -1 +1= -1. E= J.

Wait a second. So how many states have E=-3J and how many have E=J?

Looking back, state1 and state8 have E=-3J. So that's two states.

All the other six states have E=J. So each of these contributes exp(β J) because E is J.

Wait, the partition function Z is sum of exp(-β E) for each state. So for state1 and 8: E=-3J, so exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

Each of the other 6 states: E=J, so exp(-β J) = exp(-β J). But wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the exponential factor is e^{-β E}. So for E = -3J: e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

For E= J: e^{-β J}.

Wait, but in our case, the energy is E = -J (sum), so let's make sure.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So the sum inside is (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2 S3) = let's call it S. So E = -J S.

So for each state, E = -J S → S = -E/(J).

In state 1, S=3 → E= -3J.

In the other states, S = -1 → E= J.

So in the exponent, it's e^{-β E} = e^{-β (-3J)} = e^{3β J} for state1 and state8.

For the other states, e^{-β (J)}.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all 8 states.

So two states contribute e^{3β J}, and six states contribute e^{-β J}.

Wait, wait, but I'm getting two terms: 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: Z=2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because exponents are opposite.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that matches what I have.

Option C: 2 e^{2Jβ} +6 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

Option D: 6 e^{2Jβ} +2 e^{-2Jβ} → No.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait,
