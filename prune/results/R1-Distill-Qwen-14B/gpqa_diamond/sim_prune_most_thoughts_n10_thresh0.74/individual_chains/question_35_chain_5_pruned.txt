Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is Ay, which is given as c multiplied by S. Oh, right, c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question isn't directly asking for those; instead, it's asking which statement among the options is correct during the calculation.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about each step.

First, I need to figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the given matrix, let me write that out.

S matrix:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, multiplying by c, which is h/(4π):

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

So,

Ay = [ (h/(4π)) * 0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
      [ (h/(4π)) * i   (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

So,
Ay =
[ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0    ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues a of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    -a    ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

(-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

So,

a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²)/(4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So it's (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) )

So the determinant equation:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So,

a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots:

a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, because sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π), but with plus or minus.

So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4 π). Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. The matrix S is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, the Pauli sigma y matrix is:

σy = [0 -i; i 0]

So, S is σy. And the intrinsic angular momentum operator for spin-1/2 particles is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Wait, for spin, S = (ħ/2) σ. Because spin angular momentum S is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S. And c is h/(4π). Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Intrinsic angular momentum for a spin-1/2 particle is S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, the components like Sy would be (ħ/2) σy. But in this problem, Ay is c·S, where S is given as a 2x2 matrix with rows (0 -i) and (i 0). Oh wait, that's exactly the σy matrix.

So, S is σy. So, Ay = c * σy.

So, c is h/(4π). So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times those, so ± c.

So, that's ± (h/(4π)).

Wait
