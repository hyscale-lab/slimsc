Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on. Hmm, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into photons. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy and their directions are measured—one is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left. Or wait, no: the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right—so it's moving to the left? Or wait, the direction is relative. Let me clarify.

The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its velocity is positive (say, to the right). The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, so its velocity is towards the left, negative direction.

Wait, but in terms of momentum, the positron has momentum opposite to the electron's? Because it's moving in the opposite direction. But Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilation occurs, and it's equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means higher velocity.

But wait, since both are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum before annihilation would be the sum of their relativistic momenta.

Wait, but let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy and momentum before annihilation must equal the total after.

So the initial system has an electron and a positron moving towards each other. Let's model this in one dimension first, perhaps, but the photons are moving in two dimensions.

Wait, but the problem says that both photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions.
