Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed, so that's an important starting point. I remember something about parallax and distance being related, but let me think this through.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance in parsecs (d) is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), right? So d = 1 / plx. Oh yeah, that's from the parallax formula.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they're asking about the density of stars in terms of parallax. I think this involves some geometry or maybe a volume calculation.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their density in space is constant. So the number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the size of that volume. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

Let me think about the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, right? So a thin shell with radius r and thickness dr would have a volume approximately equal to 4πr² dr. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and multiplying by dr gives the volume of the thin shell.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, and the density is uniform, N = n * V, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). But how does this relate to parallax?

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d. So d = 1/plx, as I thought earlier. Therefore, r (the distance) is 1/plx. Hmm, but I need to express the volume in terms of plx.

Let me substitute d with 1/plx. So the volume of the shell becomes 4π (d)² * (dd), but wait, what's dd in terms of plx? Let's see, since d = 1/plx, then dd/ddx would be... wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of plx. The volume element is 4π d² dd. Now, since d = 1/plx, then dd would be the change in d, which is -1/(plx)^2 d plx. Wait, because if d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). So, when plx increases by a small amount d(plx), d decreases by (1/plx²) d(plx).

So, the volume element dV = 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx, but I can ignore the negative sign since we're dealing with magnitudes.

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. Wait, no, let me re-calculate:

Wait, d =1/plx. So d squared is (1/plx)^2 = 1/(plx^2). And dd is (1/plx^2) d plx. Because plx increases when distance decreases, so when plx increases by d plx, d decreases by that amount multiplied by (1/plx²). 

So putting it all together: dV = 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π / plx^4 * d plx.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. The volume element is dV = 4π d² dd. Since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d. So when d is small, a change in d is related to a change in plx. Let me express dd in terms of d plx.

dd = (dd/d plx) d plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2). So, dd = (-1/(plx²)) d plx. But I can take the absolute value because we're dealing with positive ranges, so dd = (1/(plx²)) d plx.

So substituting into dV: dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx²)) d plx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Therefore, the volume element in terms of plx is proportional to (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit range of plx would be the number density multiplied by the volume per unit plx. Since the number density n is constant, the number of stars per unit plx interval is n * dV. So, that's n * (4π / plx^4) d plx.

Hmm, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if we consider a thin slice of plx from plx to plx + d plx, the number of stars N in that slice is N = n * dV, which is n * (4π / plx^4) d plx.

So, the number per unit plx is N/(d plx) ) = n * 4π / plx^4. So the number density in terms of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no, maybe I messed up. Because when you're considering the number per unit of plx, perhaps I should think in terms of how the number of stars in a slice of plx width d plx depends on plx.

But earlier calculation led to the number of stars in a plx interval d plx being proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx would be 1/plx^4.

Wait, but looking at the options: option A is 1/plx^4, D is 1/plx^3, etc.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because I thought it would be 1/plx^2. Maybe I've made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the density in space. The number of stars per unit volume is n, a constant. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, dr = (dd/d plx) d plx. Wait, d = 1/plx, so dd/d plx = -1/(plx²). So dr = -(1/plx²) d plx. So the volume in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π/(plx^4) d plx.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in the shell is n * 4π/(plx^4) d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is n * 4π/(plx^4). So the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, that would suggest that the number of stars decreases rapidly with plx. But I thought the number of stars per unit parallax would decrease with the square. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up something here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the solid angle. Each star has a certain solid angle.
