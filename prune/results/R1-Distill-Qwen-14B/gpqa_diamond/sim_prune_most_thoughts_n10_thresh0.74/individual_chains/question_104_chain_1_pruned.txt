Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift is periodic, and the size of the shift depends on the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main variables here are the Doppler shifts measured. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method formula involves the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) which is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K, the semi-amplitude, is something like K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) * (1 / (sqrt(a))) ) ... Hmm, maybe I'm mixing some terms here. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass (M*) and the planets have similar masses (M_p), and the orbits are circular (so e=0), the formula might simplify. Also, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M* + M_p)) a³. Since M_p is much smaller than M*, M* + M_p ≈ M*, so P² = (4π²/(G M*)) a³. So a is proportional to (P² G M*)^(1/3).

But how does the RV semi-amplitude K relate to the Doppler shift? K is the star's velocity, which causes the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift (delta lambda) is proportional to K. Because delta lambda (in wavelength) is given by (v/c) * lambda_0, where v is the velocity (K), lambda_0 is the rest wavelength. So delta lambda is proportional to K.

Wait, the problem provides the Doppler shift in terms of milliangstroms. So for planet #1, delta_lambda1 =5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, delta_lambda2=7. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the main variable is the orbital period, but how?

Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K depends on the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital parameters.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) ) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(sqrt(a (1 - e²)))) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should recall a simplified version. For circular orbits (e=0), and M_p << M_*, the formula can be simplified.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / (a^(1/2)) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(
