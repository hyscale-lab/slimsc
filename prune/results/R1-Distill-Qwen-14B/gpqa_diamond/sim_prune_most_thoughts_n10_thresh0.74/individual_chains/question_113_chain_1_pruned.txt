Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. I've got to figure out the chemical formula from the given options. The options are either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

First, I'll look at each piece of data and try to interpret what they might indicate about the structure of the compound. Let's break it down.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually correspond to O-H stretching. If it's very broad, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak. Alternatively, if it's a broad peak but not as strong, maybe an alcohol. Hmm.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, carboxylic acid, or maybe an amide. The 1650 is a bit lower. Wait, what gives that? Maybe conjugated carbonyl groups? Like an aromatic ring with a carbonyl. For example, in a ketone with conjugation, maybe? Or perhaps an ester or another carbonyl compound. Alternatively, sometimes the 1650 region can indicate an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the Hs attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, maybe something like an alkene. So the structure might have both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Looking at the mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what could produce a 45 mass. Common fragments include CH3COOH (45?), but let me check. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of, like, (CH3)2O maybe? Or perhaps a fragment like C3H7O? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like CH3OCH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think: The molecular weight of 45. Let me calculate: 45 is 12*3 + 1*9 + 16*1? No, 12*3 is 36 plus 9 is 45? No, 36 plus 16 is 52. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh, wait, I think a common fragment is the methyl ester group losing some parts. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Wait, maybe it's the tropylium ion? No, that's a bigger fragment.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. For example, if the compound has a benzene ring, but I'm not seeing that in the options. Wait, the options are all C6H..., so the molecular formula would be for molecules like esters, ethers, maybe.

Wait, perhaps the fragment comes from an ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe it breaks into a smaller fragment. Let me think: for instance, if the compound is something like an ester with a benzene ring, but here the formula is C6H10O2 or similar. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, the m/z 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO, which would be 58. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of other possibilities. 

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the four given, so perhaps that can help. Let me list the options:

A) C6H12O2: Degree of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2)/2 = (14-16)/2? Wait, no, wait the formula is 2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here, it's (2*6 +2 - H -0 +0)/2. For each option:

Option A: C6H12O2, so H is 12. (2*6+2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1. So one
