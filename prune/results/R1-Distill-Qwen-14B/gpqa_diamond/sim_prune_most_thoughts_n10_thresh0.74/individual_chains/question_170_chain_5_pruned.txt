Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, in what basis is this state given? Oh right, in spin problems, the states are usually represented as column vectors in the basis of spin-up and spin-down. So the state vector χ is a two-component vector.

So χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right. Now, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as <χ|Ô|χ>, where Ô is the operator in question. Here, the operator is S_y.

Wait, what's S_y? Oh, I remember. The spin operator along y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma matrix σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. And σ_y is the matrix:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So to find <S_y>, I need to compute <χ| S_y |χ>. Let me write this out step by step.

First, let me compute χ†, which is the conjugate transpose of χ. So χ† would be [ -3i, 4 ], because the first component is 3i, so its conjugate is -3i, and the second is 4, which is real.

Wait, no, wait. The original χ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose would be [3i*, 4*]. 3i* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Next, I need to compute S_y acting on χ. Let me write that out. So σ_y multiplied by χ.

So σ_y is:

0   -i
i    0

So multiplying σ_y by the vector [3i, 4]^T:

The first component is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

The second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that multiplication:

First entry: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 -4i.

Second entry: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So yeah, [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

But wait, I think I messed up the order because matrices are multiplied from the left. Let me recheck:

sigma_y is 2x2 matrix, χ is 2x1. So the product is:

First row: 0 * 3i + (-i) *4 = 0 -4i → -4i.

Second row: i *3i + 0 *4 = 3i^2 → 3*(-1) = -3.

Yes, that's correct. So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So S_y χ is (ħ/2) times that. So S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value is χ† multiplied by S_y χ. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ], and S_y χ is [ -4i ħ/2, -3 ħ/2 ].

Wait, no, better to compute χ† (sigma_y χ) first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So χ† σ_y χ = [ -3i, 4 ] * σ_y * [3i,4]^T.

Wait, maybe
