Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z. Oh wait, mu = γS_z, right? And the magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's moment is aligned with the field, which makes sense because that's the lowest energy state.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. Oh, so first it's along Z, then it switches to Y. I wonder how this affects the spin of the particle.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So after the field changes, the z-component starts oscillating. I need to find the frequency of that oscillation.

Hmm, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction. But wait, the system's state might not be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the spin will start precessing, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field B. The energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to mu · B. Since mu is gamma times S, the Hamiltonian should be H = -gamma B S · n, where n is the direction of the field.

Wait, wait, the standard form is H = -μ·B, but since here mu is gamma S, so H = -gamma B S · direction. Oh, but the sign might depend on convention. Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is U = -mu · B = -gamma S · B.

But wait, for a spin in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is usually written as H = -γ B S · n, where n is the direction unit vector. So when the field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_z.

So the initial state is when the field is along Z. The system is in an eigenstate of S_z, so the spin is up or down along Z. But then the field is switched off and turned on along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait a second— the problem says both fields have the same magnitude. So the initial B is along Z, then it's turned off, and another along Y with same B. So after the switch, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but when you change the field, the spin state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the system will start evolving, and the expectation value of S_z will oscillate.

I need to find the oscillation frequency of <S_z>. How do I approach this?

I recall that for a spin in a magnetic field, the expectation value oscillates with the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is given by the energy splitting divided by Planck's constant. The energy levels for spin-1/2 are ±(gamma B)/2 times ħ. So
