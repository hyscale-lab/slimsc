Okay, so I've got this question about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere blocks it. So how does this work?

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift. Redshift (z) affects the observed wavelength. The formula for redshift is observed wavelength (位_obs) equals rest wavelength (位_rest) multiplied by (1 + z). So 位_obs = 位_rest * (1 + z).

But wait, since the neutral hydrogen is in deep space, it's probably moving away from us, so the light is redshifted. The background quasars are being used, so the absorption lines in their spectra are what we detect. The quasar emits light, and the cloud in front absorbs at 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the problem is that ground-based telescopes can't observe UV. So if the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms, but the observed wavelength after redshift has to be in the optical range, which is longer than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) up to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). Because if the observed wavelength is in the optical, we can detect it.

So the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. When it
