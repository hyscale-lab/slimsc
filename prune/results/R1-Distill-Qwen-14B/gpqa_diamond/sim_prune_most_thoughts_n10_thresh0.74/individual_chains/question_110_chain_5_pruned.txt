Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. 

First, I'll read the question carefully. The key points are that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So, the stars must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, no—actually, I think it's the other way around. Let me check: the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO, and "brighter than 16 V mag" with HIRES. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, if it's less than 16, HIRES can see it. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects.

Wait, right, because the magnitude scale is inverted. So a star with V magnitude 15 is brighter than one with 20. So when the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17, that means apparent V mag ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can only go up to 16, and ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So any star that's ≤16 mag will be visible by both. But wait, wait: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Hmm, that's confusing. Do they mean brighter (so less than 17) or fainter than 17? Because typically, a star that's brighter than magnitude 17 would have a magnitude less than 17. For example, the Sun is about -26.7, which is brighter than 17. So if a star is brighter than 17 (i.e., <17 mag), both can detect it. But if it's fainter (≥17), only ESPRESSO can
