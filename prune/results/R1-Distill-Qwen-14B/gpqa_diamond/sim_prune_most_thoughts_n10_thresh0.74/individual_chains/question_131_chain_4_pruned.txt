Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a specific NMR and 13C NMR spectrum. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm. Let's start by thinking about the initial steps.

The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene dehydrates to form an anhydride. So, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid would typically form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride is important here. The NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is downfield. 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Wait, 165 ppm is probably a carbonyl group, like an ester or anhydride. 137 ppm is likely a carbon adjacent to a double bond or maybe an aromatic proton, but I think in this case, it's part of an alkene.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That area is usually for protons near electronegative groups, like maybe the protons on the carbonyl in an anhydride. But wait, anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. Or maybe the single peak is due to two equivalent protons on the same carbon.

Wait, let me think. If the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid, when it dehydrates, the anhydride would have a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected by a bridge. Since the starting acid has a cis-alkene, that might influence the structure of the anhydride. So, perhaps the anhydride is a five-membered ring? Or maybe a bicyclic structure?

Wait, the 1H NMR shows only one peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all the protons are equivalent. So maybe the anhydride has a symmetrical structure. For example, if the anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are across from each other, leading to equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketene anhydride, but I'm not sure.

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165. So, 165 is probably the carbonyl (maybe two carbonyls in the anhydride but they are equivalent, so only one peak). 137 could be a carbon adjacent to a double bond, or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond. Wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so when it dehydrates, perhaps the alkene becomes part of the anhydride. So, in the anhydride structure, there might be a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

Wait, let me sketch this out. Suppose the starting dicarboxylic acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond in the middle. So, perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right because it's not a cis diene. Wait, the starting acid has a cis-alkene. So, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, more accurately, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, but that's a trans configuration. No, the starting material has cis. So, the double bond is between two CH2 groups, and the substituents on each end are the same, making the structure symmetric.

When this dicarboxylic acid dehydrates, it would lose a molecule of water to form an anhydride. The dehydration would likely occur between the two carboxylic acid groups, leading to a cyclic anhydride. So, perhaps it's a five-membered ring, which is common for anhydrides. For example, the structure would be a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and a double bond from the original alkene.

Wait, if the original structure was HOOC-CH2-CH2
