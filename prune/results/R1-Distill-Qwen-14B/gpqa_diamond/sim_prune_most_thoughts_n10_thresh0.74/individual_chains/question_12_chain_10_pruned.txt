Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I think I can figure it out. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. The Pi(+) is stationary, so that probably means it's at rest when the decay happens. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two values, probably the KE of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into other particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after the decay should be zero because the initial momentum was zero.

Wait, the pion is a boson, and it's decaying into a muon and a neutrino. Since the neutrino is a lepton, it's neutral and hard to detect, but I guess it's just another product here. So the decay products are mu+ and nu.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Let me recall the four-momentum approach. The total four-momentum before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, since it's stationary. The four-momentum after decay would be the sum of the four-momenta of the muon and the neutrino.

So, conservation of energy would be the total energy before equals the sum of energies after. Similarly, conservation of momentum would require that the vectors cancel each other out.

Let me think in terms of invariant mass. The mass of the pion is the sum of the energies of the decay products minus any kinetic energy, but wait, no, I think it's more about the invariant mass squared being equal on both sides.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations. Let me denote the muon as mu and the neutrino as nu.

The pion is at rest, so its four-momentum is (E, 0), where E is its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon has energy E1 and momentum p1, and the neutrino has energy E2 and momentum p2. Since momentum must be conserved, p1 and p2 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p1 = -p2.

But wait, since p is a vector, but in this case, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before is zero. Therefore, the vector sum of mu's and nu's momenta must be zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, the magnitudes would be equal, and their directions opposite.

So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, considering energy: the total energy before decay is 139.6 MeV, which is equal to the sum of energies of mu and nu after decay.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But each of these energies is the sum of their rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Wait,
