Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. Knockout mutants were made, and double mutants as well. The experiment measures their resistance to anthracnose. The control has 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The results are:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (so super susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately susceptible)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

I remember that when you have epistasis, it's about how genes interact. If a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests that one gene is downstream of the other. Like, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the double mutant a b has the same phenotype as a. Because gene A is downstream, so if it's knocked out, it doesn't matter what B does.

Wait, I think the other way around—if the double mutant looks like gene B, then gene B is epistatic to gene A. No, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of pathways. If gene A is upstream, then knocking out A would affect the pathway regardless of B. For example, if A activates B, then without A, B doesn't get activated. So the double mutant a b would be same as a.

But in this problem, g2's single mutant is 0% resistance, same as the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3. So what's the conclusion there? It suggests that maybe G2 is downstream, because when G2 is knocked out, it's worse than either G1 or G3.

Wait, the g2 single mutant has 0% resistance, which is the same as when any of the double mutants that include g2. So maybe G2 is at a point in the pathway where it's essential. Like, if G2 is not working, nothing can save it. So perhaps G2 is the last step, or a key transcription factor that activates other genes. Because the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 still have 0% resistance, same as g2. So the presence of other mutations doesn't make it any worse, just the same as g2.

So the hypothesis is that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when you have a mutation in G2, the other mutations don't matter—it can't function, so the resistance is gone.

Now, the fact that g1 is 75%, which is less than the control but not as bad as g2, and g3 is 50%. So G1 and G3 each contribute to some resistance, but not as much as G2.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either individual mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, or perhaps they function redundantly. Because when you knock both out, the effect is additive. Wait, but if they were in the same pathway, maybe knocking both out doesn't make it worse. Hmm.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. But when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse. For example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) have some function. But when both are knocked out, their combined effect is worse than either alone. So g1g3 is 10%, which is lower than both. That suggests that they function in the same pathway but are additive. So that would be redundancy.

So, putting this together: G2 is the key gene here. Its knockout is the most severe, and any double mutant with G2 knockout is as bad as G2 alone. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But the question says at least one is a TF upstream. So maybe G2 is the TF?

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter. Same promoter would mean they are part of a operon—probably not applicable here since plants typically don't have operons like bacteria.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic toward G3. Hmm, not sure. From the data, G2 is epistatic, not G1.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic toward G3. Wait, but from the data, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is worse than either alone. That suggests that they are in the same pathway, perhaps redundant. So when both are missing, it's worse than each alone.

Wait, but in this case, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the epistatic relationship is that G2 is downstream. Because in the double mutants with G2, all have 0% resistance.
