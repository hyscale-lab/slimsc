Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let me think through the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Since both planets have Earth-like masses, I don't think the mass affects the transit probability directly; it's more about the orbital configuration.

Wait, but actually, the minimum mass is known, but the actual mass might be higher since it's determined by the RV method. But for transit probability, the mass of the planet relative to the star probably doesn't matter as much as the size of the planet. Oh, but wait, the question says they've already been detected via RV, so they have their minimum masses. But for transit, what's important is the size of the planet relative to the star because a larger planet (relative to the star) blocks more light when it transits. But in this question, I'm not told about the planet sizes, only their masses. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says both planets have Earth-like masses, but Earth's radius is given, perhaps? Or maybe the radii are same because the question doesn't mention that. Hmm, no, the question doesn't specify the planet radii. Ah, but wait, the star radii are the same. Oh, right, the host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius.

So the transit probability formula I think is P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (something else). Wait, no, the actual formula for the transit probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² times the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The latter part depends on the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.

Wait, but for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the planet transits is roughly R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (or orbital radius) of the planet. Because the transit occurs only when the planet's orbit is edge-on, which has a certain geometric probability.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula more accurately. The transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula I remember is that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is such that the planet passes in front of the star. The latter part is the geometric probability, which is R_s / a_p, where a_p is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

So putting that together, the transit probability P is (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s / a_p) ) = R_p^2 / (a_p R_s).

Wait, that simplifies to (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s). So P is proportional to (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s).

But wait, in this problem, I don't know the planet radii. They're both Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are the same. Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. But maybe in the problem, both planets have the same radius
