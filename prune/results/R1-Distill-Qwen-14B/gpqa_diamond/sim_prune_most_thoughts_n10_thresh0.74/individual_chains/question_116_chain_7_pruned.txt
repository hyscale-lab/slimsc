Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question starts with compound A, which has two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring groups, each with two protons (maybe a CH2 next to another CH2). Similarly, a quartet suggests three neighboring protons, like a CH2 next to a CH3.

So compound A’s NMR suggests it has two sets of groups. The 6H at 0.9 ppm as a triplet—maybe two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon or something. Wait, 6 hydrogens would be three groups of two, right? So maybe a structure like –C(CH3)2– something. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—could that be two sets of two protons each, maybe adjacent to another CH2 group. So putting it together, perhaps compound A is neopentyl something, like 2,2-dimethylbutane or something similar. Wait, wait, let me think. 2,2-dimethylbutane would have a structure like CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH3. But then looking at the NMR, the CH2 groups adjacent to the C(CH3)2 would be split into quartets or triplets.

Wait, another thought. If the triplet is 6H, that's probably two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon, each CH3 having 3 H. So two CH3 groups would be 6 H. The triplet implies that each of these CH3's is next to a CH2 group. So the structure would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH2CH2)C(CH3)2. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted ethyl group where each substituent is CH3.

Wait, another approach: the 6H triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because a CH2 group next to another CH2 would lead to a triplet.
