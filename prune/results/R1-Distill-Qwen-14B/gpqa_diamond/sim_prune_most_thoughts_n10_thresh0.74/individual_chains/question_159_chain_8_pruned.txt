Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cosmology, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to unpack what's being asked here.

The question is about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Hmm, I remember that in astrophysics, the peak of emission or absorption can relate to the redshift of the object. Oh wait, right! The peak wavelength observed is longer than the emitted one if the object is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe. So that's redshift.

The peak at 790 nm suggests that the emitted wavelength was shorter. Let me think, if the rest frame peak is in the optical, maybe around blue or green? Wait, quasars emit a lot across the spectrum, but near-infrared suggests a longer wavelength. Let me think. The peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared, so maybe it's a redshifted version of a rest-frame optical emission line or something. Like the Lyman alpha line or something else? Wait, Lyman alpha is in UV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the so-called Lyman break, where the emitted UV light is absorbed by hydrogen, making a drop in flux below a certain wavelength. Oh! That rings a bell. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm. So if the quasar emits in the UV, but due to redshift, this limit shifts to optical or IR, making a drop
