Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. The options give possible product structures.

First, I need to figure out what the reaction is doing. The starting material is an ether with a substituted butenyl group attached to the oxygen, connected to the benzene ring.

The structure of the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out mentally. The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-Bz? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, structures. Wait, but the substituents are on which carbons? The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but wait, but that's but-1-enyl? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH. No, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl group would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's impossible because butenyl is four carbons. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

But-3-en-1-yl: the parent chain is four carbons long. The double bond starts at C3, meaning it's between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, that's not possible because C3 and C4 are the third and fourth carbons. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH
