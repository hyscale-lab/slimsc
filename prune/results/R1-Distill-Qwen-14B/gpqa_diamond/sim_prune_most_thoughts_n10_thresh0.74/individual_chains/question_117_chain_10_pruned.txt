Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So the question is asking which of the given compounds can exhibit this.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected. So the structure is biphenyl with substituents. I'm thinking about the substituents here. The molecule has two methyl esters (from 2,2'-dicarboxylate) and two nitro groups on the 6 and 6' positions. Wait, the central carbon in biphenyl is connected to two methyl ester groups and two nitro groups on each benzene? Or wait, maybe each benzene has substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is attached to four different groups. Oh wait, no. Because in biphenyl, the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, so each benzene is attached to that central carbon. But wait, in 6,6'-dinitro, that's the position on each benzene. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other substituents? Or is it part of the structure where the central carbon has other substituents? 

Wait, the structure is more like the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond between their 1 positions. Each benzene has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. The 2,2' positions have the dicarboxylate groups, and 6,6' have nitro groups. So looking at the central carbon (the one connecting the two benzene rings), what is attached? Each benzene is attached on either side, and then the substituents at 2 and 6 are on each ring. Wait, but the central carbon is part of each benzene ring, so it's a bridge? No, in biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected at one carbon each. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, but each of those benzene rings has additional substituents. So the central carbon (like position 1 on each benzene) is attached to two other substituents? Let me think
