Okay, so I have this question about a quasar observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically looking at the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The question says there's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at wavelengths shorter than that. I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance of this quasar based on the given cosmological parameters.

Hmm, let's think. First, I remember that in astrophysics, the peak emission of an object can tell us something about its temperature. The peak wavelength is related to the temperature by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is approximately 2.9 × 10^-3 m·K divided by the temperature T. So, λ_max ≈ 2.9e-3 m·K / T. So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is 790e-9 meters, I can plug that into the formula to find T.

Let me calculate that: 2.9e-3 m·K divided by 790e-9 m. Wait, 790e-9 is 7.9e-7 m. So 2.9e-3 / 7.9e-7. Let me compute that. 2.9e-3 is 0.0029. 7.9e-7 is 0.00000079. So 0.0029 divided by 0.00000079 is approximately 3671 K. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again. 0.0029 / 0.00000079 is the same as 2900 / 0.79, which is roughly 3670 K.

So the temperature of the quasar's emission is around 3670 K. But wait, quasars are very bright and complex objects. They have emission lines and a lot of thermal emission, but I think the peak here might be from the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole. So that temperature would make sense for an accretion disk, perhaps.

But how does this relate to the distance? Oh, right, the peak wavelength observed tells us about the redshift. Because if the source is moving away, the wavelength is stretched, so the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength. So we can relate the observed wavelength to the rest wavelength (assuming the peak is from a particular process, like the accretion disk) to find the redshift z.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. So, the peak wavelength is in the near-infrared. Near-infrared is longer than optical, so if the rest frame peak is in the optical, then the observed near-infrared suggests a redshift. Or, if the peak is emitted in the near-infrared, but observed at a longer wavelength, that would imply more redshift.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the emitted light is at 790 nm, but observed at a longer wavelength, that would suggest redshift. But the question says that the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. So perhaps the peak is in the near-infrared as observed. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about whether the peak
