Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about annihilation. Hmm, the question says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. I remember that in annihilation processes, like when particles and their antiparticles meet, they convert their mass into energy, usually producing other particle-antiparticle pairs. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact mechanics here.

So the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So, considering conservation laws, which ones apply here? Well, charge must be conserved. The proton has a charge of +e, the antiproton is -e. So total charge is zero. On the right side, each A+ is +e, and A- is -e. So 2*(+e) + 2*(-e) equals zero. So charge is conserved, that's good.

Also, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Oh wait, but in that case, maybe we can approximate things using non-relativistic mechanics? Or perhaps not, since the resulting particles might be moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving"—so maybe it's non-relativistic. But the products are A particles, whose rest mass is 300 MeV. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², I think. So the A particles are lighter than protons. So if the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, their rest mass is 938 each, so total rest mass is 1876 MeV. The products are four A particles, each 300 MeV, so their total rest mass is 1200 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products is less than the initial, which means there's plenty of energy for kinetic energy.

But wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can model this as a collision where the initial kinetic energy isn't too high. Or maybe considering the center of mass frame. Oh, right, because in annihilation, the conservation of energy and momentum works in the center of mass frame, where the total momentum is zero.

Wait, no. Because the proton is at rest, I think. Or is the proton also moving? Oh wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So probably, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it.

Wait, the initial setup: the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with low speed. So initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. After annihilation, the products (the four A particles) must carry away momentum. But the problem asks for the velocity of each A particle, so perhaps they are all moving in the same direction, or maybe two pairs moving in opposite directions. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the system is symmetric. Since the reaction produces two A+ and two A-, perhaps they form two pairs moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each pair (A+ and A−) is moving in opposite directions with the same velocity. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of particle A. So each A must be moving at the same speed? Or maybe each pair (like two A+ and two A−) are moving together. Or perhaps the problem is symmetric in a way that each A has the same velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle has the same speed as the others because of symmetry. So I think we can assume each A has the same velocity, say v.

But let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial frame: the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately its rest energy plus kinetic energy, but since it's moving slowly, maybe we can model it non-relativistically. Wait, but if the products are moving relativistically, the initial system's energies might be better handled with relativistic equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be approached in the center of mass frame. Because in that frame, the total momentum is zero. So after annihilation, the total momentum must also be zero. So the particles would have to move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other out.

In the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after annihilation must also be zero. So for the four A particles, their momenta must add up to zero.

So let's model this. Let's say that two A+ and two A− are produced. Since each A+ and A− have opposite charges, maybe they are moving in opposite directions, but perhaps in pairs.

Wait, but each A has the same mass, so each has the same rest mass. Suppose that two A+ are moving in one direction, and two A− are moving in the opposite direction, each pair with the same speed. So their momenta would cancel each other.

Alternatively, maybe each A+ and A− are moving in opposite directions, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, but that would give a total momentum, which can't be, because the initial frame's momentum is zero. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe in the center of mass frame, the products are symmetric. So maybe the four A particles are moving in pairs. For example, two go in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, each with the same speed. So their momenta would cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps two A particles are moving in one direction, and two in another, but arranged symmetrically. For simplicity, perhaps each pair has the same speed but opposite directions.

Let me think about the conservation equations.

In the center of mass frame, initial momentum is zero. So after annihilation, the total momentum must be zero.

Assuming all four A particles have the same speed magnitude, but arranged such that their momenta cancel out.

Suppose two A particles are moving with velocity v in the +x direction, and two are moving with velocity v in the -x direction. Then the total momentum would be 2γmv - 2γmv = 0, which satisfies momentum conservation.

But wait, each A has charge, but the velocity direction doesn't affect the momentum. So the momentum from each is γmv in their direction. So two in +x, two in -x, each with same speed: their momenta cancel.

Now, the energy must also be conserved.

The initial energy in the center of mass frame is the total rest energy of the proton and antiproton: 2 m_p c². Because in the center of mass frame, each has energy m_p c², so together 2 m_p c².

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles.

Each A has energy E = γ m_A c².

So total energy after: 4 γ m_A c².

So setting initial equal to final: 2 m_p c² = 4 γ m_A c².

We can solve for γ.

Wait, but γ is a factor for each A's velocity. So:

2 m_p c² = 4 γ m_A c²
Divide both sides by c²:
2 m_p = 4 γ m_A
Divide both sides by 4 m_A:
γ = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A)

So γ = m_p/(2 m_A) * 1

But wait, the given m_A c² is 300 MeV. And m_p c² is about 938 MeV.

So m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So γ = (938) / (2 * 300) = 938/(600) ≈ 1.5633.

So γ is approximately 1.5633.

Now, γ is 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Let's solve for v.

First, take reciprocal: 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.64.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.64.

Square both sides: 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ (0.64)^2 = 0.4096.

So (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

Take square root: v/c ≈ sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768.

So v ≈ 0.768 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(600) = 1.563333...

So γ = 1.563333.

1/γ² = (1 - v²/c²) → (1/ γ² ) = (v²/c² )'s complement.

Wait, wait: (v/c)^2 = 1 - (1/γ² )

So 1/γ² = (1 - v²/c²)

Wait, no. Wait, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ².

So v²/c² = 1 - (1/(1.5633)^2 )

Compute 1.5633 squared:

1.5633 * 1.5633 ≈ let's compute:

1.5633 * 1.5633:

1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25.

But more accurately:

1.5633^2 = (approx) 2.445.

So 1/γ² = 1/(2.445) ≈ 0.409.

So v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.

v/c ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769, so 0.77c.

So that's option A.

But wait, another thought: since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial assumption about the frame is incorrect. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton at rest), then the center of mass frame might not be the same as the lab frame.

Wait, but the problem asks for the velocity of the A particles. If in the lab frame the antiproton is moving slowly, but considering that after annihilation, the products are moving relativistically, perhaps we need to consider the lab frame rather than the center of mass.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because in the lab frame, the initial momentum is only from the antiproton.

Wait, perhaps I should think in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity u, which is small.

So in this frame, the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy.

The initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum, since the proton is at rest.

After annihilation, the four A particles must have total momentum equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton.

But how can four particles have their momenta sum to that initial value? Since they're produced symmetrically, perhaps two are moving in each direction. But this could get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that in the center of mass frame, the velocity is v, and that's the speed we're looking for. But why would the A particles all be moving at the same speed in the center of mass frame? Because when the initial particles are annihilating, they produce products that are symmetric.

But wait, in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the products must move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other. So for four particles, perhaps two pairs moving in opposite directions, each pair with velocity v and -v.

But each A has the same mass, so the momenta would be ±γ m_A v. So for two moving +v and two -v, the total momentum would be 2γ m_A v - 2 γ m_A v = 0.

So then, the energy must be the sum of four γ m_A c².

So the initial energy in the center of mass frame is 2 m_p c² (proton and antiproton each have m_p c² rest energy), so 2 m_p c² = 4 γ m_A c².

Which simplifies to γ = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) )= m_p/(2 m_A) = 938/(600) ≈1.5633.

So then, as before, v is 0.77c, so option A.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So in the lab frame, the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ_antiproton m_p c².

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ_antiproton ≈ 1 + (p^2)/(2 m_p^2 c^2), but if u is small, then p = γ m u ≈ m u (since γ≈1). So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p u², which is small compared to m_p c².

So the initial energy in the lab frame is approximately m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton) + (1/2) m_p u².

Which is about 2 m_p c² plus a small amount.

But the problem is, in the lab frame, after annihilation, the four A particles have some energies and momenta that must match the initial energy and momentum.

But this seems complicated, because in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero, and the products must have momenta that sum to that initial value.

So perhaps it's better to work in the center of mass frame, where the initial momentum is zero, and then the products have a total momentum of zero, leading to the velocities I calculated earlier.

But wait, the problem is asking for the velocity of the A particles in which frame? The question doesn't specify. But I think it's in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest. Because that's the usual setup unless stated otherwise.

But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be solved in the center of mass frame, and the velocity found is the same in all frames. But no, velocity depends on the frame.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the center of mass frame, and thus the velocity v is 0.77c. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, let's think: in the center of mass frame, each A has velocity v ≈0.77c.

But in the lab frame, where the antiproton is moving slowly, the velocities of the A's would be different due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the question didn't specify the frame, but in physics problems, when not specified, it's usually the lab frame.

Wait, but without more information, perhaps the intended approach is to use the center of mass frame, leading to option A.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because the statement that the antiproton is moving slowly suggests that the initial kinetic energy is small, so perhaps the center of mass is not too far from the lab frame. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be better. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate the process as non-relativistic, but that might not work because the products could be moving relativistically.

Wait, but the rest mass of the A is 300 MeV, and the initial rest mass is about 938 MeV each. So the total rest energy is 1876 MeV. The rest energy of the products is 4*300=1200 MeV. So the available energy is 1876 MeV, so each A particle could have significant kinetic energy, meaning they might be moving at relativistic speeds.

So back to the initial approach: perhaps we can model this in the center of mass frame, leading to the velocity 0.77c.

But wait, going back to the initial setup. Let's model the process in the lab frame, where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity u, which is small.

So initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ_{u} m_p c².

Since u is small, γ is approximately 1 + (u²)/(2 c²).

The initial momentum is p_initial = γ_{u} m_p u ≈ m_p u, since u is small.

After annihilation, the four A particles have some energies and momenta, but their total must match the initial.

But this seems complicated, because we have four particles with unknown velocities and directions. Perhaps it's easier to consider that in the center of mass frame, the calculation is manageable, leading to the velocity v as 0.77c, and then perhaps applying a Lorentz transformation to get the velocity in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved assuming that all the kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass of the A particles, which isn't the case, but maybe as an approximation.

Wait, but that approach might not give the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that in the center of mass frame, the four A particles each have the same speed, and thus we can calculate their velocity as in the center of mass frame, which would be option A.

But the question is about the velocity in which frame? The problem statement doesn't specify. It just says "what is the velocity of particle A".

If we assume the velocity is in the center of mass frame, then option A is correct. But if it's in the lab frame, the velocity would be different.

But in most cases, the question likely expects the center of mass approach.

Wait, but in reality, when a proton and antiproton annihilate, they produce a variety of particles, but in this case, four A particles, each with 300 MeV rest mass.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in the center of mass frame, leading to the velocity v ≈0.77c.

I think that's the intended approach. So the correct answer is option A, 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Key Assumptions and Conservation Laws
1. **Charge Conservation**: The total charge before and after the annihilation is zero, ensuring the reaction is valid.
2. **Energy and Momentum Conservation**: These must hold in the center-of-mass (COM) frame, where the total momentum is zero initially. After annihilation, the total momentum of the products must also be zero.

### Energy Analysis in the COM Frame
- The initial energy in the COM frame is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton:  
  \[
  E_{\text{initial}} = 2 m_p c^2
  \]
  where \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).

- After annihilation, the total energy is distributed among the four \( A \)-particles. Each \( A \)-particle has energy \( \gamma m_A c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The total energy of the system is:  
  \[
  E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
  \]

- Equating the initial and final energies:  
  \[
  2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma m_A c^2
  \]
  Simplifying for \( \gamma \):  
  \[
  \gamma = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633
  \]

### Momentum Analysis in the COM Frame
- In the COM frame, the total momentum of the system is zero. After annihilation, the four \( A \)-particles must move symmetrically to conserve momentum. For simplicity, assume two \( A \)-particles move in the \( +x \)-direction and two in the \( -x \)-direction, each with the same speed \( v \). This ensures their momenta cancel out.

### Solving for \( v \)
From \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):  
\[
\gamma = 1.5633 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} = \frac{1}{1.5633} \approx 0.64
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = (0.64)^2 \approx 0.4096 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
\]
\[
v/c = \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.769 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion
The velocity of each \( A \)-particle in the COM frame is approximately \( 0.77c \). This matches option **A**.
