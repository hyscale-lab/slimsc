Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a multiple-choice question about reaction sequences to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. Let me imagine the benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering in benzene is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, if I have a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3, that's correct.

Wait, positions: let me visualize. Let's say the benzene ring is numbered clockwise. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. Wait, no, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So in the benzene ring, substituents are at positions 1,2,3. So in order, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro.

So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, but for synthesis, I need to plan the order of reactions to introduce these groups.

Benzene is the starting material. Let me think about the possible reactions. The substituents are a nitro group, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. The ethoxy is an ether, so that's an activating group, whereas the nitro is deactivating. The tert-butyl is a bulky substituent, which is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group) but it's bulky.

I remember that nitration is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para-directing, and the tert-butyl would also be activating and ortho/para. But when multiple substituents are present, the directing depends on their activating or deactivating nature.

Wait, but the order of introduction of substituents is crucial. Because once you add a substit
