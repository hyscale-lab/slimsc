Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about IUPAC nomenclature. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me break it down.

Alright, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group (which is an aldehyde), and a cyano group, all meta to each other. So meta positioning means each is separated by two carbons. Wait, no, meta is 1,3 positions. So all three are at positions 1, 3, and 5? Wait, no. Wait, the question says all meta to one another. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Because three substituents can't all be meta to each other in a benzene ring. Wait, maybe two of them are meta, and the third is in another position. Hmm, perhaps I misread that. Let me read again.

Oh, wait, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. So each is separated by two carbons. So if one is in position 1, the others would be in 3 and 5? But that would make them all meta to each other. Wait, because 1,3,5 are all meta positions relative to each other. So that makes sense. So they're at positions 1,3,5. But wait, the numbering of the ring could vary based on substituents,
