Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. That means the angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (since it's s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the electron is going from n=3 to n=1, which is a two-step transition because n must change by 1 each time (since Δn can be ±1 for dipole transitions). So first, it goes from 3→2, and then 2→1.

Now, the first transition is from 3,0,0 to 2, something. What l and m can it have? Since l must change by ±1, so initial l was 0, so after transition, l must be 1. So the first state must have l=1.

So the first transition is to a state with l=1. So the possible m values for that state would be m = -1, 0, +1. Because from m=0, m can change by ±1 or 0. Wait, no, wait. The selection rule is Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, you can go to m'= -1, 0, or +1. But wait, the l for the first state is 1, so m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition is to a state with l=1 and m=0, +1, or -1. Then, each of those needs to transition to the final state |1,0,0>.

Wait, the final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So from the first transition state (n=2, l=1, m=?), it needs to transition again. So for the second transition.

What are the possible l and m for the second step? For the second step, n goes from 2→1, so Δn = -1. l must change by ±1 again. So from l=1, l can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state has l=0, so for the second transition, l must go to 0. So from l=1, it must go to l=0. So the second state's l is 0.

Now, the m for the second transition must be such that from whatever m it was in the first state, it changes by 0, ±1. But the final state's m is 0. So, the first state's m must allow a transition to m=0 in the second step.

Let's think about each possibility.

First transition possibilities:
1. From |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>
Second transition: |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> ?
Check m: initial m is 0, so can go to m=0 ±0, ±1. So m=0 is allowed (since Δm=0). So yes, this path is possible.

2. From |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>
Second transition: |2,1,1> → |1,0,0> ?
Here, m is 1. Final m is 0. Δm would be -1, which is allowed. So this is also possible.

3. From |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>
Second transition: m is -1 → 0. Δm= +1, allowed. So this is also possible.

Wait, but the problem states that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the question is, which of these options correctly shows the transition route and has the correct probability.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1> → 1/4.

Option D: It says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 2/3.

Wait, but the options for the probabilities vary. So the question is, which sequence is possible, and what's the probability.

Wait, but the problem is about decay via two transitions, but I think the probability is about the chance of each possible transition path. Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability of the total transition from 3→1 via two steps.

But I think that each transition has its own probability, and the total is the product. But I'm not exactly sure about that. So perhaps I should think about the possible possible transition paths and their probabilities.

Wait, in the first transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. The possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So there are three possible states for the first transition.

Then, from each of these, the second transition must go to |1,0,0>.

So for each of the three possibilities:

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,0>:
Second transition: l=1 → l=0. So m=0 can go to m=0. So allowed.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1,1>:
Second transition: m=1 must go to m=0. So Δm = -1. Allowed.

Case3: First transition to |2,1,-1>:
Second transition: m=-1 → 0. Δm=+1. Allowed.

So all three paths are possible. Now, what determines the probability? The selection rules are about which transitions are allowed, but the actual probabilities depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which in turn depend on the integrals of the wavefunctions.

But perhaps we can approximate that each allowed transition has the same probability. But I don't think that's necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules allow certain transitions but the probabilities are different.

Wait, in the dipole approximation, the transition probability is proportional to the
