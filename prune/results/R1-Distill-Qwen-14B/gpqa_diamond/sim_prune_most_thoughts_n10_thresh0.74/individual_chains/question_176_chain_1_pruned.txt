Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I should probably normalize that. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors, meaning their norm is 1. Let me calculate the norm. So the components are -1, 2, and 1. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is actually 1/sqrt(6) times (-1, 2, 1). I'll need that for calculations.

Then there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their matrix operators. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me jot it down:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And the matrix for Q is:

First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring Q just after measuring P. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the order of measurements is important. They measure P first, then Q. But wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the sequence is P first, then Q. But wait, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the state after measuring P will be an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q would be done on this new state.

But wait, wait, the problem says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first, when measuring P, the outcome is 0. Then measuring Q, the outcome is -1. So the overall probability is the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and then -1 in Q given that P was 0.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Because the state is initially given as (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6). Let me denote this as |ψ>.

First, I need to find the probability of measuring P=0. To do that, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of |ψ> onto each of these eigenvectors, square the norm, sum them for all eigenvectors of that eigenvalue.

Then, given that P was measured to be 0, the state collapses into this eigenvector. Now, I need to measure Q on this new state and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the measurement of Q is done on the original state after P's measurement, which is an eigenstate of P. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Let me first find the eigenvalues and eig
