Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, that relates to the excitation of electrons in atoms, which has to do with thermal energy. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) )

So in this case, the energy levels are E_i and E_j. The ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_i) to the ground state (n_j) depends on the energy difference and the temperature.

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio n1_i / n1_j is 2. For star_2, let's say the ratio is 1, because it's half as excited? Wait, no, the problem says star_1 is twice as excited, so star_2 would be half that? Or maybe I need to set it up more carefully.

Let me restate: for star_1, (n_i)/(n_j) = 2. For star_2, (n'_i)/(n'_j) = 1. Because star_2 is less excited, so the ratio is lower. 

So for each star, we can write the Boltzmann factor. Let me write the equations.

For star_1: (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )
For star_2: (n'_i / n'_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, since they're the same element. So g_i/g_j is a constant, same for both.

So let me denote (g_i/g_j) as some constant C. Then, equation for star_1: 2 = C * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And for star_2: 1 = C * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, if I take the ratio of these two equations, perhaps. Let me divide the equation for star_1 by the equation for star_2.

(2 / 1) = [ C exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ C exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

The C cancels out, so 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which simplifies to 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, let me see: -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So that's the exponent. So ln(2) equals [ΔE/(k)] * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, because taking ln on both sides: ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me rearrange that a bit. Let me write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k ) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting that in:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k ) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but do I know the value of ΔE and k? Well, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38e-23 J is exactly the value of Boltzmann's constant k. Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, yes, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K. So substituting ΔE = k:

ln(2) = (k / k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Simplify, k cancels, so:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be written as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, let's see option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct equation is option D.


The question involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J, which matches the value of Boltzmann's constant \( k \). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the excitation of energy levels to temperature:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)
\]

For star_1, the excitation ratio is \( \frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \), and for star_2, it is \( \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = 1 \). Assuming the statistical weights \( g_i/g_j \) are the same for both stars, the ratio of the two equations gives:

\[
\frac{2}{1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)
\]

Simplifying the exponent:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = k \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches the form of option D. The correct equation for the effective temperatures is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
