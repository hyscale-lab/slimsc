Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable, P, and getting a value of 0 at a given time t. 

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically column vectors, and they should be normalized. Oh wait, but wait a second. Let me calculate the norm of this state vector. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2, which is 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors have to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the magnitudes is 1. So, I guess I need to normalize the state vector first. 

Wait, but the problem statement says the state is given by that column matrix. So maybe I should proceed by normalizing it. Alternatively, perhaps the vectors are given in some non-unit form. Wait, but I think the observable's matrix is given, and perhaps the state is the given vector, but it's not normalized. So I need to normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The norm squared is 6, so the normalized state would be |ψ> divided by sqrt(6). So each component is divided by sqrt(6). 

But wait, maybe the state is already normalized. Let me check again. The components are -1, 2, 1. Sum of squares is 6. So sqrt(6) is the norm. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) times the vector [-1, 2, 1]. 

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Hmm, I should write that out as a matrix.

So P is:
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)      0    ]
[ 1/sqrt(2) 0        1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0        1/sqrt(2)      0    ]

Now, in quantum mechanics, to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue, you need to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator. But wait, how is this operator defined? Is it a Hermitian matrix? Because observables are represented by Hermitian operators, which have real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors.

Let me check if P is Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Let's compute the conjugate transpose of P. Since all entries are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So P^T:

First row becomes first column: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row becomes second column: 1/sqrt(2), 0
