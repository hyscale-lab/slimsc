Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to figure out the correct one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh right, identical particles mean that they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle because they're fermions (spin-1/2 implies they're fermions). So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin. Since they're spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states.

So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest energy states without violating the exclusion principle. Let's think about how to arrange them.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. That means the lowest possible n values, each with both spins filled.

Let's list out the possible states:

Each energy level is E_n = n² E.

In the ground state:
- The first energy level is n=1. Since we have two particles with opposite spins, we can place two particles here. Wait, no. Wait, each particle needs a unique set of quantum numbers. So for spin-1/2, each n can have two particles (m_s = +1/2 and -1/2). So n=1 can have two particles. Then n=2 can have two as well, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because each n can have two particles because of the two possible spins. So the first two particles can be in n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two would have to go to higher n. Let me think again.

Wait, no, for four particles, the lowest possible way is to fill the lowest possible n's with as many as possible.

The ground state would be the lowest possible configuration. Let's see:

The first particle goes to n=1, spin up. The second goes to n=1, spin down. The third particle can't go to n=1, so it has to go to the next available n, which is n=2, spin up. The fourth goes to n=2, spin down.

So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), the ground state is when the first two are in n=1, and the next two in n=
