Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. I remember that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits, and that it depends on things like their radius, temperature, and other factors.

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but mass and radius don't directly determine luminosity unless we consider other factors. Oh right, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L depends on R squared and T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That’s an important point.

If T is the same for both stars, then the luminosity difference can be calculated based solely on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² T^4, and T is the same, L is proportional to R squared.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Since R1 is 1.5 R2, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A or D, but wait, there's more. Oh wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Let me re-read that part.

The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving away or towards us at
