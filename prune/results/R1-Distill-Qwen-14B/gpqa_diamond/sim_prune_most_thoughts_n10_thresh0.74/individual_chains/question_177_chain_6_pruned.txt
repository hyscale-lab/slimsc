Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm. I remember that luminosity is related to the star's radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. Let me think.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh wait, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. Or perhaps it's a red herring.

The other thing mentioned is that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength emitted by a black body is determined by Wien's Law. Wien's Law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, that's important. Because if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity depends only on the radius and temperature. Stefan-Boltzmann law is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So since L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth, and T is the same, L depends on R squared.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4). Since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1²)/(R2²) = (1.5 R2)^2 / (R2)^2. The R2s cancel out, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

But wait, the options have some other numbers. Let me check the options again. Option A is ~2.25, which matches what I just calculated. But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s.
