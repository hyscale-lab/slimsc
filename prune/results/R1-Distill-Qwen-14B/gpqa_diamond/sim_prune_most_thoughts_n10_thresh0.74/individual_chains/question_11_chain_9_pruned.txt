Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking which of the statements A, B, C, D is incorrect. So I need to find the exception among correct statements.

Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: It says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in mismatch repair. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to nsp10 to form an active exonuclease. Wait, I remember that SARS-CoV-2 has an RNA proofreading ability, which is because of its ExoN activity. The ExoN is part of the nsp14 protein, and I think it works as a heterodimer with another protein. Oh right, nsp10 is a cofactor for nsp14's ExoN. So their complex acts as a 3'â†’5' exonuclease, which corrects base-pairing errors during replication. So A sounds correct.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, which involves death receptors like Fas, TNF. Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic pathway, mitochondrial. The statement says that since Bcl-2 levels aren't affected, it's extrinsic. I'm a bit confused because I thought SARS-CoV-2 can trigger both pathways. ORF3a might activate RIPK3, leading to necroptosis, but does it cause apoptosis via caspase-8? I think some studies suggest that ORF3a can induce apoptosis, but whether it's through extrinsic or involves both pathways. Alternatively, maybe ORF3a primarily affects the mitochondrial pathway. Wait, another thought: if it's activating caspase-8, which is extrinsic, but Bcl-2 is intrinsic, and the statement says Bcl-2 expression isn't affected. So the mechanism is extrinsic. Hmm. I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe this statement is wrong? Or not. I'll need to think more.

Option C: Frameshifting rate correlates with the number of pseudoknot conformations. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two conformations under tension. I remember that the frameshifting mechanism involves a pseudoknot structure in the viral RNA that causes the ribosome to shift by one nucleotide. The number of conformations affects how efficiently the frameshifting occurs. So if they both have two, their rates are similar. That sounds correct. So C is a correct statement, so not the exception.

Option D: Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near the 5' end, using slippery nucleotides and pseudoknot. Wait, SARS-CoV-2's frameshifting occurs near the 5' end, right? The ribosome shifts back, creating a -1 frameshift. The statement says that SARS-CoV-2's frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV. I think both have a similar mechanism, so D is correct. So D is a correct statement.

So the incorrect statement is either A, B, or maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me think again. Option A says the complex prevents breakdown of dsRNA. Wait, the ExoN is an exonuclease that removes nucleotides to correct errors, so it's involved in proofreading. So the statement says it prevents dsRNA breakdown. Wait, exonucleases usually break down nucleic acids. So if the ExoN is active, wouldn't it cause breakdown? But the complex is supposed to correct errors by removing incorrect bases, not necessarily preventing breakdown. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the nsp14-ExoN is an exonuclease that works with nsp10. It's responsible for the proofreading activity during replication. So when replication makes errors, the ExoN removes the
