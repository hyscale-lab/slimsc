Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”that is, infinities that pop up in calculations. These divergences are problems because you can't have an infinite result in a physical theory. Regularization introduces a temporary 'cutoff' to make calculations finite, after which you can take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way.

So, the options are:

A) Superstring Theory
B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
D) Classical Electrodynamics

Wait, I need to figure out which one doesn't require regularization. Let's go through each option.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED has processes like electron-positron pair production, and it does have divergences. Because of this, renormalization is necessary, and since regularization is part of the renormalization process, QED requires regularization. So option C is out.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's also a quantum field theory, so similar to QED, it has divergences. But wait, I think QCD is asymptotically free. That means at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes weaker. Wait, but does that mean it doesn't have the same problems? No, I think QCD still requires regularization because it's a non-abelian gauge theory with elements like confinement, but that doesn't eliminate the need for handling divergences. So option B is also out.

Classical Electrodynamics (option D) is a classical theory. It doesn't involve quantum mechanics, so it doesn't have the same issues with divergences that quantum theories do. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have infinities in the same way because it's not a quantum field theory. But wait, I thought even in classical E&M, there are issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge. Oh right, but in practice, classical theories don't require regularization because they don't use perturbative expansions with loops where divergences occur. Or wait, do they handle it differently? Hmm. I'm a bit confused
