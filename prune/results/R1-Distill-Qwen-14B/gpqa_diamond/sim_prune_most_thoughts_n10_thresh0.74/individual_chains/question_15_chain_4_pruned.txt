Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits, and I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me break it down step by step.

So the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 has a much shorter orbital period, meaning it's closer to its star.

The stars both have the same radius. Wait, even though one host star (Planet_1's) is twice as massive as Planet_2's host, their radii are the same. Interesting. So, more massive stars can have the same radius? Hmm, maybe because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but same radius as Planet_1's host, which is a main-sequence star perhaps.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So higher probability to transit means it's more likely to pass in front of its star from our point of view. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit and the size of the planet relative to the star, I think.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I remember that the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (a / (a * sin i)), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the probability of a transit is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) over the star's diameter, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a_p) / (a_p * sin i) ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe another approach.

I recall that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but wait, that seems off. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)² × (1 / (a_p / R_s)) )? No, wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, from what I remember, the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1)
