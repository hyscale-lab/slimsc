Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down each reaction.

First reaction: Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, what's happening here? I think this is some kind of nucleophilic addition reaction.

NaCN is a source of CN- ions. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, typically it undergoes nucleophilic addition. For example, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can be protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. The CN- then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. So, the product should be a cyanohydrin, which is exactly what's formed here—2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the reagent A is needed for that. So what's A? In the preparation of cyanohydrins, usually a strong acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ is used as a catalyst. So A is probably H3O+ or another strong acid. Let me look at the options. Options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. But wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. It's a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is from sulfuric acid). But in the case of the cyanohydrin formation, I think H+ is needed to protonate the ketone. So perhaps A is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, I'm leaning towards A being H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (and water) to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So, from a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, especially with H2O, the nitrile group (-CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using HCl as a catalyst might be involved.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. Let me see the structure: 2-hydroxybut
