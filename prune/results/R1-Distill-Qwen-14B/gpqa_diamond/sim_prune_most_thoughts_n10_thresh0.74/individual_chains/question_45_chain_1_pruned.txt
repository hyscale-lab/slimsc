Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies in terms of E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each a set of three numbers. 

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels of a single particle are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit as given. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...).

But wait, there are four particles here. And they are identical fermions because they're spin-1/2. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But since the particles are in a 1D well, they only have one quantum number each, which is n. So in this case, each particle must have a different n value because they can't share the same n. 

Wait, but wait again. In a 1D infinite well, each state is characterized by the principal quantum number n. So each particle must have a distinct n. So for four particles, the possible n values would be 1, 2, 3, 4. Because each higher n corresponds to a higher energy state, and they can't have duplicates. 

So the total energy of the system would be the sum of each individual energy. So the ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible n values, which are n=1,2,3,4. So the ground state energy would be E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4. Let me compute that. 

E_1 is (1²)E = 1E.
E_2 is (2²)E = 4E.
E_3 is 9E.
E_4 is 16E.

Adding them up: 1 +4 +9 +16 = 30E. Oh wait, but wait, that's the ground state. But wait, what's the question again? The question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited. So if the ground state is 30E, what comes next?

Wait, no, wait. Because in the ground state, the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels with each having a unique n. So the ground state is 30E. But then, the first excited state is when one of the particles is promoted to the next available n. But wait, how do the excited states work here. Because in a system of multiple particles, the first excited state would be the state with the lowest possible energy higher than the
