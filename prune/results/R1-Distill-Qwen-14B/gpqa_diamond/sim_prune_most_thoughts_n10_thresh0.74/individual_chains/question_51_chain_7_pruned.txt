Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Alright, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves the work done to bring charges together, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details here.

The setup is a charge q placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. The sphere is grounded, which I think means it's connected to the Earth, so its potential is zero. Wait, but what does that imply about the charges on the sphere? Oh right, when a conductor is grounded, any excess charge on it will go to ground. So if the charge q near the sphere induces any charges on it, they might redistribute or even not stay on the sphere. Hmm, no, wait. Oh wait, no. For a conducting sphere, the charges induced by an external charge will reside on the surface. But since it's grounded, any induced charges would cause a flow of current until the sphere's potential matches the ground's. So in this case, maybe the induced charges on the sphere adjust until the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, the sphere is conducting, so the potential is the same everywhere on its surface. And because it's grounded, that potential is zero. So any charges induced on the sphere must arrange themselves so that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. But I'm not sure how that affects the system's potential energy.

Potential energy of the system. So I think the potential
