Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator, denoted as A_y, is given by a matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

First, I remember that the angular momentum operators like A_x, A_y, A_z are related to the spin matrices. For spin-1/2 particles like the muon, the spin matrices S usually represent the components of the spin angular momentum. But wait, wait, in this case, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so A = c·S, where c is h/(4π). I think the factor c comes from the conversion between angular momentum units. Because the spin matrices S have units of ħ/2, so when multiplied by c, they give the correct units for angular momentum.

Wait, let's think about the units. The spin matrices S (like the Pauli matrices) typically have eigenvalues ±1/2 times ħ. So if A = c·S, then A's eigenvalues would be c multiplied by those. Let me compute c: c is h/(4π), and h is Planck's constant. Wait, no, actually, ħ is h/(2π). So c would be h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So A = (ħ/2) S. Therefore, A's eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1/2 (because for Pauli matrices, like σ_y, the eigenvalues are ±1), wait no wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so if S is proportional to σ_y, then S would have eigenvalues ±1. Or wait, maybe S is the actual spin matrix, which would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Let me clarify. The spin matrices S for a spin-1/2 particle are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So S = (ħ/2) σ. So for example, S_y would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. But in the problem, S is given as a 2x2 matrix with first row (0 -i), and second row (i 0). Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so that's exactly the S matrix here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Therefore, S is σ_y, and the operator A = c * S would be c * σ_y.

Wait wait, but the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0 -i), second (i 0). So that's σ
