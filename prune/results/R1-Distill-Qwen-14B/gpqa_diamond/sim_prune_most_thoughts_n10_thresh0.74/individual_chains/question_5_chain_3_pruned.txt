Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The problem states that the operator is P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in x-z, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? Because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane corresponds to θ varying from 0 to π/2 and 3π/2 or something.

Wait, the operator P might be a spin operator since it's given in terms of components with ħ/2. Oh right, spin-1/2 systems typically have operators like Sx, Sy, Sz, which are ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So P here could be the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So the eigenvectors would be the spin-up or spin-down states along a particular direction.

So the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) |ψ⟩. But wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the operator P is being considered along an arbitrary direction n. Oh wait no, actually, the operator given is for each component, but when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you have to construct it as a combination of the components.

Wait, the operator P is given as a vector operator. So the operator along direction n would be P · n, where n is a unit vector. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Wait, actually, the direction in the x-z plane is usually described with θ from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? No, wait, actually, in the x-z plane, the angle would be φ=0 or π maybe? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it can have components in x and z (and y=0). So n = (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1.

The operator P along n is P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since P_y's component is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane.

Wait, no, the dot product is n · P, which would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator whose eigenvector we're seeking is P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so:

(P
