Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and complexes? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is usually something like CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- after it's deprotonated.

So the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex, but I want the free calcium ions. The formation constant, K, is given. I think the formation constant is Kf, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in various protonated forms. But the problem says pH is ideal, so I guess I can assume that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so [EDTA^4-] is constant and I don't have to worry about the different species. That makes things easier.

So, the complex is CaY²- which dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

Because the complex dissociates completely? Or wait, no. At equilibrium, only a tiny amount dissociates because Kf is very large, meaning the complex is stable. So most of the Ca-EDTA remains as the complex, and only a little dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, EDTA^4- would also be x, and the concentration of the complex would be approximately 0.02 - x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), x should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression becomes Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formation constant is [complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand. So here, [CaY²-] is 0.02, [Ca²+] is x, and [EDTA^4-] is x as well.

So Kf = (0.02)/(x^2) =5e10.

Wait, no, because in solution, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the dissociation is CaY²
