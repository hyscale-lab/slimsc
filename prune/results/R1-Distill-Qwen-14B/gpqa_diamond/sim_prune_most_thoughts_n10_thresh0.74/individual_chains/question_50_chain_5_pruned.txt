Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process and the terms in the perturbative expansion. Each loop usually adds a factor of the coupling constant or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's break it down.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * (1/(4pi)^6) * (Q/M)^2. I need to relate this to the loop count.

Wait, I think the general formula for the amplitude scaling with loops is something like (loop factor) * (coupling terms). Each loop typically contributes a factor of (something like 1/(16 pi^2)) for each loop in four dimensions, but maybe it's more involved here.

Alternatively, I remember that the number of loops relates to the superficial degree of divergence and the scaling of the amplitude. The superficial degree of divergence is given by D = 4 - L*(d), where d is the dimension, but maybe that's more for renormalization group stuff. Not sure if that applies directly here.

Wait, another approach. The number of loops L in a Feynman diagram is connected to the number of integrals you have to evaluate. Each loop adds an integral over a momentum, but the exact scaling depends on the diagram.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the dependence on the coupling constants and the overall factors. Let's consider each part:

The given expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * (1/(4pi)^6) * (Q/M)^2.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity. I think in QED, each photon propagator contributes a factor of alpha, and each loop might involve some power of alpha.

Wait, but in terms of loop expansion, each loop brings in a factor of (alpha/(4 pi))^{L/2} where L is the number of loops. Or maybe it's (alpha)^L. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the expansion parameter. In perturbation theory, each loop contributes a factor of the coupling constant to some power. For example, in
