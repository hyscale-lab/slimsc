Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. The reactions involve some rearrangements, specifically the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is something about dienes rearranging when heat or light is applied. Let me think.

The first reaction starts with a compound: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. So, that's a benzene ring attached to a (CH2OCH2CH(CH2CH3)) group. Wait, no, let me structure it correctly. The molecule is benzene with a substituent: the substituent is a (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group. So, maybe it's (CH2-O-CH2CH(CH2CH3)) attached to benzene? Wait, no, the substituent is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Oh, right, that would be CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl group attached to benzene. So, the main part is benzene with a substituent: the substituent is a CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but wait the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the oxy is in the middle. Let's break it down:

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, the butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond starting at position 2. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, perhaps better to write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but double bond between 2 and 3. So the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. So, the oxy is attached to the first carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure is: the benzene ring has a CH2-O-group attached. The O is connected to
