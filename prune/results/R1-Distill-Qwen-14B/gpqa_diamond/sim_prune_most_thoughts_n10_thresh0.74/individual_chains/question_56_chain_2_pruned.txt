Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, selection rules for dipole transitions... Oh right! The selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are: Δn can be any integer except 0 (so n changes by at least 1), Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh, and the m values can change by 0 or ±1, but not more.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So n goes from 3 to 1, which is a Δn of -2. But wait, the selection rule says Δn can't be 0, but it can be ±1, ±2, etc. So that's allowed.

But wait, no—wait a second. Oh, no. Wait no, the dipole selection rules for hydrogen specifically require Δl = ±1. Because the transition must change the orbital angular momentum by one unit. So l must change by ±1. So from l=0 (s orbital), the next possible l is 1 (p orbital).

So when the electron is in |3,0,0>, l=0. To transition via dipole, it must go to l=1. So the first transition would have to go to a state with l=1. Then, from l=1, the next transition must go to l=0 again, because the final state is l=0.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It can dipole transition to a state with l=1. But then, from l=1, it has to go to l=0, which is the final state's l. So the process is two steps: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m? → 1,0,0.

Wait, but wait, when transitioning, n can change by more than 1, but each dipole transition can only change n by ±1? Or no, wait,
