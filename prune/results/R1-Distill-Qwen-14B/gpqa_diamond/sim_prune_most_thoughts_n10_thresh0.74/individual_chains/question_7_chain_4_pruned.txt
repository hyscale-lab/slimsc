Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The task is to find the energy of these gamma-rays where their lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of a particle is limited by processes that can cause its decay or annihilation. In this case, the gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. So the lifetime here would be determined by the inverse of the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate depends on the probability of the gamma-ray interacting with a CMB photon.

I think the cross-section for this process might be important. Oh right, the cross-section σ is a measure of the probability that a photon-photon interaction will occur. The formula I remember for the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron pair production is something like σ ~ (α² / (s)) * (something), where α is the fine-structure constant, and s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

Wait, more specifically, the cross-section for two photons producing a pair is given by the formula σ = (4πα²)/(9s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy (s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, but since photons are massless, s = 4 E1 E2 (1 + cosθ), where θ is the angle between them. But if the gamma is much higher energy than the CMB photon, perhaps we can approximate something here.

Wait, but the CMB photons are at a much lower energy. So E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy. So E1 is much larger than E2, because gamma-rays are high energy and CMB photons are about 1e-3 eV. So E2 = 1e-3 eV, and E1 is our gamma-ray energy, which we'll call E.

So the cross-section equation is σ = (4π α²) / (9 s). But s is the square of the center of mass energy. Wait, the
