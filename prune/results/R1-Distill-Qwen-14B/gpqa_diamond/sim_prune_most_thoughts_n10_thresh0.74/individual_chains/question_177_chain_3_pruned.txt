Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read through the details again to make sure I get all the facts straight.

Alright, so Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Interesting, but I'm not sure how mass plays into this because the question is about luminosity. Luminosity usually relates to radius and temperature, right? Oh, wait, the problem says they both radiate as black bodies, so I can probably use the Stefan-Boltzmann law here.

The problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, T is same.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. If λ_max is the same, then T = b / λ_max. So same λ_max implies same T. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

Now, we're told about their radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, so the observed λ_max is same, but their actual temperatures might be different? Wait, no. Let me clarify this.

Wait, the question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. But if one is moving towards us or away, that would shift the observed wavelength. But Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So, using the Doppler effect, the observed wavelength would be different unless there's some other factor.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me think. So if Star_2 is moving towards us (
