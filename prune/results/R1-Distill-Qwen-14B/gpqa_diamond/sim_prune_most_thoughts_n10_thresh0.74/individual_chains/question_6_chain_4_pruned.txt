Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read the question again.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given by (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²(θ). I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be solved by separating variables or recognizing the form as known systems. Let me think about the structure of the potential here.

The potential has two terms: (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks a bit like a harmonic oscillator potential but with an additional angular component. Oh, right! The first term is like the radial part of a 2D harmonic oscillator, which has energy levels proportional to n_x + n_y + 1/2, but wait, in 2D, the harmonic oscillator is usually treated in terms of n = n_x + n_y, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. That's cos squared theta multiplied by r². Let me think about how this affects the potential. Cos squared theta can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of angular momentum or something.

Wait, wait a second. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the (1/2)k r² term. That would give V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, because (3/2) is 3 times (1/2), right? So yes, that's correct.

So, [1 + 3 cos²θ] can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + cos(2θ))/2. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, we get:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

Wait, so V(r,θ) becomes (1/2) k r² [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ]. Or simplifying, (5/4) k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but how does this help me? I remember that when a potential depends on cos(2θ), it suggests that the angular part of the wavefunction might involve higher-order angular momentum components. Alternatively, could this be a case of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes in 2D, polar coordinates can be converted to Cartesian to simplify the problem.

In polar coordinates, x = r
