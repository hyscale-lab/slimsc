Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the surface area is covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so their temperature is 5000K. The astronomers are observing this star, and when it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the interesting part is that this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the same brightness changes. The question is asking: if instead, the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same light curve amplitude? So, we're comparing the effect of the planet blocking some light to the effect of the spots changing the star's brightness.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit causes the same dip in brightness as the star's spots do when they rotate into view.

Wait, but wait. The way the spots affect the brightness is a bit different from a planet's transit. When the planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip. The depth of that dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. The star's spots, on the other hand, are cooler regions, so when they are facing towards us, they make the star appear dimmer. But when they rotate away, the brightness goes back up. So the observed brightness variation depends on how much the spots contribute to the overall brightness.

Wait, but the question says that the situation (spots) can resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what we'd see if a planet were transiting. So the amplitude of the brightness variation (the depth of the dip) is the same in both cases.

So the first thing I need to calculate is the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude caused by a planet transiting, to find out what planet size would give the same dip.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness would change as the spots rotate into and out of view. Since one hemisphere is covered, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, more of the cooler spots are visible, making the star appear dimmer. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted side is facing us.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is rotating, so each spot comes into view as the star spins. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the front, so the observed brightness decreases. When the other hemisphere comes into view, the spots are on the back, so the brightness returns to normal. So the brightness variation depends on how much the spots contribute to the total flux.

The star's effective temperature is Teff = 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of the surface area is covered by spots.

The star's total flux when spots are visible will be the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

The flux from a star is proportional to the surface area and the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). So the total flux F is F = σTeff^4 * A, where A is the surface area. But when spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

So the total flux when the spots are facing us would be F_total = F_normal - F_spots + F_spots_lower.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The star's total flux when the spots are visible (as we're seeing them) would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part plus the flux from the spotted part.

The unspotted area is (1 - filling factor) times the total surface area. The spotted area is the filling factor times the surface area.

So the normal flux (without any spots) would be F0 = σ * Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2), but since we're looking for relative changes, the 4π Rstar^2 can be factored out.

The flux when spots are visible is F = (1 - f) * σ Teff^4 * (4π Rstar^2) + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4 * (4π Rstar^2), where f is the filling factor, and ΔT is 1000 K.

So the relative change in flux (ΔF/F0) is:

ΔF/F0 = [ (1 - f) Teff^4 + f (Teff - ΔT)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1

Simplify that:

= (1 - f) + f ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 - 1

= -f + f ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4

= f [ ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 - 1 ]

Wait, no. Let me compute it again.

Wait, the expression is [ (1-f) * Teff^4 + f * (Teff - ΔT)^4 ] / Teff^4 - 1.

Expanding that, it's (1-f) + f*( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ) - 1.

Which is (1-f -1) + f * [ (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ]

= (-f) + f * [ (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 ]

= f [ ( (Teff - ΔT)/Teff )^4 - 1 ]

Wait, no, wait: (1-f)*Teff^4 + f*(Teff - ΔT)^4 → that's the numerator. So dividing by Teff^4 gives (1-f) + f * ( (Teff-ΔT)/Teff )^4. Then subtract 1 to get the relative change.

So the relative change is (1-f) + f * x^4 -1, where x = (Teff - ΔT)/Teff.

Which simplifies to (-f) + f x^4 → f (x^4 -1 )

So yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.20, Teff = 6000 K, ΔT = 1000 K → (Teff - ΔT) = 5000 K.

x = (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

x^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So x^4 -1 is approximately -0.51775.

So f*(x^4 -1) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) ≈ -0.10355.

So the relative change in flux is about -10.355%. So the star's brightness decreases by about 10.355% when the spots are visible.

But wait, when the spots are on the far side of the star, the brightness returns to normal. So the brightness variation is this dip of about 10.35% when the spots are visible.

Now, the exoplanet transit causes a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip is given by the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk. Since the planet's radius is Rpl and the star's radius is Rstar, the area ratio is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light equal to the area ratio. So the relative dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So we want this dip to be equal to the dip caused by the spots, which is 0.10355 (10.355%). So:

(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, wait. Wait. Wait a second. Because the spot effect causes a 10.355% decrease in flux. So the planet's transit must cause the same 10.355% decrease.

But wait, in the case of the spot, the dip is due to a change in the star's emission. The planet blocks some light, so that dip is (Rpl^2)/(Rstar^2).

So, set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check my calculations.

Calculating x^4: (5/6) is 0.833333.

(5/6)^4: let's compute that.

5^4 = 625, 6^4 = 1296.

625/1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So x^4 -1 = 0.482253 - 1 = -0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.2: 0.2 * (-0.517747) ≈ -0.103549.

So yes, the flux dip is about -10.355%.

So the planet's dip would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we compare the relative flux changes caused by the spots and the planet.

### Step 1: Brightness variation due to the star's spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and 20% of its surface is covered by cooler spots with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The total flux when the spots are visible is:

\[
F_{\text{total}} = (1 - f) \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
\]

where \( f = 0.20 \) is the filling factor. Dividing by the normal flux \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \), the relative flux is:

\[
\frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} = (1 - f) + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
\]

The relative change in flux is:

\[
\Delta F / F_0 = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{F_0} - 1 = -f + f \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4
\]

Substituting \( f = 0.20 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
\]

\[
\left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823
\]

\[
\Delta F / F_0 = -0.20 + 0.20 \cdot 0.4823 = -0.20 + 0.0965 = -0.1035
\]

Thus, the relative flux change due to the spots is approximately \( -10.35\% \).

### Step 2: Brightness variation due to a planet's transit
The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The relative flux change is:

\[
\Delta F / F_0 = \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

We set this equal to the flux change caused by the spots (\( -10.35\% \)):

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest match is:
