Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and the results a scientist got. Let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on qPCR, but I'll think it through.

The question says the scientist ran a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did three technical replicates for each of the serially diluted samples. The efficiency was 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, which implies a perfect linear relationship, so the data should fit the curve perfectly.

Looking at the data, each concentration's CT values are in a range that's about a 3-4 cycle difference. For example, at 100000 copies, the CTs are around 34, then 30.6 at 10000, 27 at 1000, 24 at 100, and 20.7 at 10 copies. Each concentration's CT is about 3.3 cycles lower than the previous one. Wait, wait, because lower CT means more copies, right? Because it takes fewer cycles to reach the threshold.

The options are A to D. I need to find which explains the discrepancies in the results. Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies. Oh, but all the CT values are pretty consistent within each concentration, and the trend is linear. So the issue must be in the setup, not the data fitting. Because the R² is perfect, maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not right because qPCR is used for quantification all the time. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says Ct values aren't in agreement with target amount. But the data seems to fit a perfect curve—like each tenfold dilution drops the CT by about 3.3 cycles. Since efficiency is 100%, each dilution should drop by log2(10) ≈ 3.32 cycles. That's what we're seeing here, right? So B is incorrect because the Ct values do agree.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, a tenfold dilution (each sample is 1/10th the previous) should, with 100
