Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the question is about identifying a compound X after a reaction. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. The options are four different oxirane derivatives, which I think are epoxides.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. It's a bulky base, right? So it might be involved in some kind of acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but wait, under what conditions? Oh, in nonpolar solvent and at a high temperature, 403 K. Hmm, that's like a reflux condition, maybe. Wait, 403 K is about 130°C, so probably a high-boiling solvent, maybe something like toluene or something similar.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? If compound X is an epoxide, and it's reacting with a base like this, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via a different mechanism. Or perhaps the reaction isn't about ring-opening but something else.

Wait, the product is the result of the reaction. So, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening. But wait, if the product has an epoxide, then maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening followed by some kind of cyclization or rearrangement.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, two singlets for 3H each. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a ring. But looking at the options, some compounds have methyl groups attached to an epoxide ring.

Then, the aromatic region shows doublets and such. Let's see:

The aromatic protons seem to be in a pattern that might suggest a substituted benzene ring with substituents that cause coupling. The 6.75 (d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (d), and 7.71 (2H, d) probably form a para-substituted system, maybe like a styrene group.

Wait, the 13C NMR data might give more clues. Let me look at those.

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (s, 1C)
- 28.4 (s, 1C)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm, the two methyl carbons at 21.3 and 28.4. Wait, 21 is about a CH3 attached to something, maybe an oxygen, like an epoxide? Because in epoxides, the adjacent carbons are usually around 40-50, but wait, no, wait. Let me think: in an epoxide, the carbons are usually deshielded and appear around δ 40-60 in 13C NMR. But here, the two are at 21 and 28, which might be CH3 groups attached to something else, perhaps.

The carbons at 126.9 (2C) and 127.1 (1C) suggest aromatic carbons. The 129.1 (2C) and 130.3 (1C) might be adjacent to substituents, maybe. Then, 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons attached to substituents, possibly carbonyls or oxygenated carbons. The 197.7 is a high value; that's characteristic of a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an epoxide?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, epoxide carbons in 13C NMR are usually lower than that. Wait, wait, a carbonyl is around 170-220. So 197.7 is a carbonyl, maybe an ester, ketone, or something else. Hmm, but an epoxide is not a carbonyl. So maybe the product has a carbonyl group.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe... Wait, no, all options are oxirane derivatives. So perhaps the product is an epoxide, but the NMR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of the starting material, but I thought the reaction is with an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. If the base used is 1,4-diazabicyclo[
