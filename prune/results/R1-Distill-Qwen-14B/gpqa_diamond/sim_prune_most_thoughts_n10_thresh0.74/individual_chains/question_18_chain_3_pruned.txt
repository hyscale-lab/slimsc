Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about elemental abundances in stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, probably the mass doesn't directly affect the elemental abundance ratios here. The problem is about their photospheric compositions using LTE and the EW method.

The given data for the stars are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5

Wait, but I think [X/H] is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. Or is it the other way around? Let me get that right. Oh wait, the notation [X/Y] means log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/H] would be log(nX/nH) - log_sun(nX/nH) = log(nX/nH) - (12 + log10(nX/nH)_sun) ? Wait no, wait. Let me recall: the [X/H] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the element's abundance relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun's. So [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

But wait the given data for the Sun is provided as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, which implies log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly, for Mg, it's log10(nM
