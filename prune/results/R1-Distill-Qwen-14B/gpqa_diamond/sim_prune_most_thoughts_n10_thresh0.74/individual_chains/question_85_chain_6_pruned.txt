Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature usually relates to how much energy a planet absorbs from its star and how much it radiates back. Let me think about the factors involved.

The problem gives a bunch of data. The star has 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Each planet has its mass and radius. But wait, the masses might not be directly needed for the equilibrium temperature calculation. Oh, right, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that cancels out in the ratio.

So, the formula for equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^0.5, where A is albedo. Since A is the same for both, the (1-A) term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So T_eq ratio is sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ) * (Luminosity ratio of star? Wait, no. Wait, the star's L is L = 4πR_star^2 σ Teff^4. So maybe I should consider the star's luminosity in terms of its Teff and radius.

Wait, but wait. The equilibrium temperature formula can also be written as T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^0.5. So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) * ( (1-A)/(1-A) )^0.5. The (1-A) terms cancel, so it's sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) = a2/a1. So the square root of that is sqrt(a2/a1), so T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Wait, but wait, no. Because the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So for each planet, T_eq is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2a)). So when taking the ratio T1/T2, it's sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because R and 2 are constants, so sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1).

But wait, I'm supposed to find T1 over T2. So T1 is proportional to sqrt(1/a1), T2 proportional to sqrt(1/a2). So T1/T2 is sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1).

But how do I find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets?

The problem states that both the transit and radial velocity methods detected the planets. The radial velocity method gives information about the mass of the planet and its distance via the Doppler shift. The transit method tells us the radius
