Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and sometimes their light is absorbed by other materials in space. The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, the absorption is at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon at about 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. So that's in the ultraviolet range.

But ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet well because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of that light. So if the absorbed light is shifted into the optical range, the redshift must have been enough to move this UV line into visible light.

How does redshift work again? The redshift z is calculated by the formula (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1. Or wait, another way: observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). Right.

So for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in optical wavelengths, which I think are about 400 nm to 700 nm. Let's pick the lower end because that's the lower limit. So 400 nm is the lower end of visible light.

The rest wavelength λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So we want λ_obs >= 400 nm (but wait, actually it should be 4000 Angstroms). Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm.

Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. And visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength should be at least 4000 Angstroms.

So, the observed wavelength λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms. The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms.

So plug into the formula:

z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1

So λ_obs is 4000, λ_rest is 1216.

Compute 4000 / 1216 ≈ let's see. 1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000 - 3648 is 352. So 3.352/1216 ≈ 0.28. So approximately 3.28.

So z ≈ 3.28. So the lower limit on redshift would be around 3.28. But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9
