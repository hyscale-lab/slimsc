Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the four given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, as I remember, refers to compounds that have non-superimposable mirror images, which means they are chiral. Chiral compounds have a stereocenterâ€”a carbon atom attached to four different groups. So, the key is to look for structures with such centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring. Wait, but how about the substituents? The groups are nitro and carboxylate. The structure probably looks symmetrical. Let me visualize: each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. Are there any chiral centers here? The molecule has two phenyl groups connected. The substituents are on adjacent positions, but the central carbon is connected to what? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the biphenyl structure itself is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So each ring is attached to the central bond. Now, the substituents are on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are any of these positions leading to a chiral center?

Wait, no, because the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are themselves symmetric. Unless there's a branching point elsewhere. Wait, no, the substituents are on the rings, so maybe the central bond is between two carbons, but each is attached to two phenyl groups. So, if the substituents on each benzene are in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical, like perhaps if the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that create asymmetry, maybe the molecule can have stereoisomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents leads to a chiral center in the biphenyl system
