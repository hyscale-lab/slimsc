Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, with different dependencies on 1/plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about the volume of space at a certain distance.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars should depend on the volume available in a shell at a particular distance. A shell in 3D space would have a surface area proportional to r² and a thickness dr. So the volume is approximately 4πr² dr.

But wait, parallax is inversely related to distance. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Let me express r in terms of plx. So r = 1/plx. 

The volume (dV) for a thin shell is 4πr² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, so dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr in terms of plx: since d = 1/plx, dr is the change in distance when plx changes by dplx. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but we can ignore the sign for the magnitude.

So substituting dr into dV: dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [-(1/plx²) dplx]. Wait, but dV should be positive, so maybe I should consider the absolute value. So dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. If plx increases by dplx, the distance d decreases by (d d) = - (dplx)/(d plx/d d) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the number of stars in a range of parallax between plx and plx + dplx. The number of stars N in that range would be the volume of the shell between d and d + dd, multiplied by the number density of stars.

Wait, number density is stars per unit volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, number density n is constant. So N = n * Volume.

The volume between two spheres of radius d and d+dd is (4/3 π (d+dd)^3) - (4/3 π d^3) ≈ 4 π d² dd. Because when dd is small, (d+dd)^3 ≈ d^3 + 3d² dd, so the difference is about 4 π d² dd.

So Volume = 4 π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, d = 1/p, where p is pl
