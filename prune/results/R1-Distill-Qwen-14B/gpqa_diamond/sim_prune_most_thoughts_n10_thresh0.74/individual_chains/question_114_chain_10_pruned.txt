Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different possibilities for A and B.

Wait, so I think these reactions are about the formation of nitriles and then their conversion into something else. Let me think about what reagents do what.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is a ketone. Adding NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. Oh, right, in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- and a strong base? Or maybe it's the other way around. So when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones typically react with nucleophiles in a nucleophilic addition-elimination mechanism. But for that, usually a base is needed to deprotonate and activate the nucleophile.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone has added a cyanide, but wait, where's the OH coming from? Oh, because after the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, perhaps there's a protonation step, but I'm not sure. Wait, when a ketone reacts with CN- in a nucleophilic addition, you get a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. So when a ketone reacts with CN- in the presence of an acid catalyst, it
