Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, I remember that the molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the structure better. The formula is C8H9NO. To calculate the degree of unsaturation, the formula is Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero, N is 1. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which gives 4, since three double bonds and one ring), a double bond, and maybe some other rings or double bonds. But since the NMR shows some aromatic signals, I think there's at least one benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. Triplet suggests coupling with two protons. 9.7 is a high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps an aromatic proton in a specific environment. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But a triplet there is interesting. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a phenol, but phenols are usually broader around 5-7 ppm, maybe. Or maybe an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): That's a doublet, two protons. Sounds like aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted, as in a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. So maybe substituents at positions 1 and 3, but that's not para. Wait, no, para is 1 and 4. So maybe ortho or meta, but doublet suggests two neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the structure is a bit more complicated. Let me think about the other NMR signals. 

-6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. So maybe another set of aromatic protons. If there are two doublets, maybe we have a para-substituted benzene ring. Let me think about a benzene ring with two substituents. For example, if one substituent is at position 1 and another at position 3, but that would give some coupling. Alternatively, if I have a substituent at position 2 and another at position 6, making it para-substituted. Hmm, but wait, two substituents might lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions. Let me not get stuck here yet; maybe I can come back.

-6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. That's a bit tricky. Broad suggests maybe exchange with water, like an -OH group. Or maybe it's a conjugated diene? Or perhaps allylic protons. Or if it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, but I'm not sure.

-3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. This looks like a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe next to an oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2 group or part of an ester or something. Or maybe it's part of an ether or an alcohol. Alternatively, a ketone adjacent? Wait, but it's a doublet, meaning each proton is coupling with one other. So maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else.

Putting this together, I'm thinking about a benzaldehyde derivative. The aldehyde proton is around 9
