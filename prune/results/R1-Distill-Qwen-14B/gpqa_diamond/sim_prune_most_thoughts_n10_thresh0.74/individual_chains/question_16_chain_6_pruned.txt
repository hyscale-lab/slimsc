Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's chirality in the molecule. Chirality arises when a molecule has a stereocenter, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Or sometimes, it could be due to other factors like a planar chirality, but I think for this question, we're just dealing with stereocenters.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, butene is four carbons. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, butene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂Cl? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-. But wait, 1-chloro would be on the first carbon. So structure is ClCH₂-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, wait but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-, but 1-chloro would be on the first carbon, which is the same as the double bond. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2.

Wait, (Z) configuration. So for a double bond, if the substituents on each end are arranged in a way that determines E/Z. But optical activity in this case—does this molecule have a stereocenter? Let me see. The molecule is ClCH₂-C(CH3)=CH₂. Wait, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the central carbons: C1 (Cl, CH2), C2 (CH(CH3), double bond). No, C1 is Cl-CH₂- with a double bond. So C1 is connected to Cl, CH₂-, and two double bonds? Wait no, C1 is Cl, CH₂-, and a double bond to C2. So C1 is Cl, two CH₂ groups, and a double bond? Wait, no. Let me think again: but-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is the same as the double bond. So the structure is Cl-
