Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. So the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values.

Right, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. And the decay distance would be the lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle, right? So the formula for mean decay distance (L) is L = c * τ, where τ is the lifetime. But how do I find τ?

Wait, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ * τ ≈ ħ, but I think the exact relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, maybe Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ. Let me make sure. Oh right, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. So yeah, that's the key.

But wait, wait. Because the decay width Γ is given in MeV, and the reduced Planck constant ħ has units of energy·time. So I need to convert everything to compatible units. Let me get the constants right.

So, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait,
