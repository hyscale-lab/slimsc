Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I remember from my studies that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term, and I need to figure out the possible decay channels of the boson X at the lowest order.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Oh right, the interaction term is probably something like λ times some fields. Let me think: the general form for Yukawa interactions is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So here, it's written as f-bar ψ_f multiplied by (ῡ + X), which might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be (ῡ + X), but perhaps that's part of a mass term? Or maybe it's the interaction term. Hmm, perhaps the exact form isn't critical for determining the decay products, but more about the coupling to fermions.

Wait, the problem says the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So X can decay into fermion pairs, but the fermion masses must be less than half of X's mass because that's the threshold for pair production. Because, for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So the maximum mass of each fermion would be m_fermion * 2 <= m_X. So m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses: Let me recall. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Up quark is around 2 MeV, down maybe 4-5 MeV. Then strange is about 100 MeV, charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is around 4.5 GeV, and top is way heavier, around 173 GeV. The electron is about 0.0005 GeV, muon is ~0.1 GeV, tau is ~1.78 GeV. So for X mass 6 GeV, each fermion in the decay must satisfy 2m_f < 6 GeV → m_f < 3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass less than 3 GeV?

Electron: yes, muon: 0.1 GeV, tau: 1.78 GeV. So all leptons except possibly the tau? Wait, tau is about 1.78, which is less than 3. So tau can be included.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Up and down are way below 3 GeV. Strange is around 100 MeV, so yes. Charm is ~1.5 GeV, so 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So X can decay into c c-bar, because 2m_c is about 3 GeV. Wait, but for decay to happen, the mass must be less than 6 GeV? Oh, wait, because the X is 6 GeV, and for a decay into two particles, each must have energy at least their rest mass. So the sum of the two rest masses must be less than or equal to the X's mass? No, wait, the invariant mass must be equal to X's mass. So the threshold is when the fermions are at rest, so 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So for quarks, all up, down, strange, charm are allowed. Because their masses are less than 3 GeV. But bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. Similarly, top quark is way too heavy.

Wait, but wait—when considering decay into quarks, we have to
