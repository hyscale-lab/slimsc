Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (from H3PO4 losing a proton) and the conjugate acid of PO4^3- (which gains a proton). 

I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, wait. Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. It dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate? Wait no, it's Na2HPO4 with two waters. So that would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes me think it's a buffer solution. Because a buffer is a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). In this case, H2PO4^- is the weak acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the pH of the solution would be around the pKa2 of H3PO4.

Wait, wait. Let me check the pKa values. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.
