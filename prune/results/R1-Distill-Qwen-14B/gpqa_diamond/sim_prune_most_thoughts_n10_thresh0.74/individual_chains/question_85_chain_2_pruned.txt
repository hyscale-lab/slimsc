Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says there are two planets orbiting a star, detected using the transit and radial velocity methods. The star has certain properties: mass 1.5 times the Sun, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and effective temperature 6300 K. Then, each planet has their own mass and radius. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important for equilibrium temperature calculations.

The question is about finding the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So, T1 over T2. The options are A to D.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

But wait, wait. The star's effective temperature is given, so maybe I can use that. The star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star² σ T_eff⁴. So L is proportional to R² T_eff⁴. But the equilibrium temperature of the planet, T_eq, is given by the formula where the incoming flux equals the outgoing flux. So the incoming flux is L/(4πa²), and the outgoing is σ T_eq⁴ (times (1 - albedo) because of the albedo). So setting them equal: L/(4πa²) = σ T_eq⁴ (1 - A), where A is albedo.

Wait, but I can rearrange this to find T_eq. Let's see:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

But L is the star's luminosity, which can be expressed as L = 4π R_star² σ T_eff⁴. So substituting:

T_eq = [ (4π R_star² σ T_eff⁴ (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4π cancels with 16 π as 4/16 = 1/4. So 4π R² σ T^4 (1-A) divided by 16 π sigma a².

Wait, let's compute the constants and variables:

After substituting L, the expression becomes:

[ (4π R_star² σ T_eff⁴ (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4π / 16 π = 4/(16) = 1/4. So 1/4 * (R² σ T^4 (1-A))
