Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm, okay. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base, so the titration should form acetate ions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C1) can be calculated using the dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2.

Wait, wait, acetic acid is diluted, so the moles of acetic acid remain the same. So moles before and after dilution are the same.

Moles of acetic acid initially = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the volume needed to reach 25% of the equivalence point? Or wait, the question says 25% titration, so that's when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH.

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH.

So first, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid: that's 0.001 moles, as I found earlier. So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles.

Each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³.

But wait, the total volume in
