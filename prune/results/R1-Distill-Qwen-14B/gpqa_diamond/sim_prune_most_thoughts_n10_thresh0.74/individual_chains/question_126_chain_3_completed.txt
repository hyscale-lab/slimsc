Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. 

So, Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually LiAlH4. I remember that ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols with LAH. So, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at C3, a methoxy group at C5, and the configuration is S. 

Reducing the ketone at C3 would turn it into a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait wait, no—wait, when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. The configuration—the starting material is S, but when you reduce the ketone, does the configuration change? Let me think. The ketone is a planar sp² hybridized carbon. When you reduce it to an alcohol, which is sp³, the groups around it will determine the configuration. 

The starting molecule is (S) configuration. The ketone is at C3. So when it's reduced, the OH group will be added. Let me draw the structure. 

Original molecule: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is CH2CH2(COCH2CH2OCH3), but wait, maybe I should number it. Let's see: 

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6
So, position 3 is the ketone. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2- something? Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately. 

Actually, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But in this case, the substituents are at position 5 as methoxy. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one would be CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methoxy at C5, which is the fifth carbon. So the substituents are:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O (from hexan-3-one)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Or is it CH2CH2?

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO) in the middle. So the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's seven carbons. Oh, no, hexan-3-one is six carbons, with the ketone at position 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4,5,6. So positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH2
6: CH3?

Wait that's not correct because 3 being the ketone would have groups on both sides. So hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. Hexane is six carbons. So hexan-3-one would be:

CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's seven. No, wait, each "CH2" is a carbon. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one structure: the chain is six carbons, ketone at C3. So it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? But that would be seven carbons, that can't be right. Maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons before the ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps the exact structure isn't necessary for determining the product.

So, when LAH reduces the ketone, it becomes an alcohol. So the product is 3-hexanol derivative with the methoxy. But wait, the starting material is (S)-configured. When the ketone is reduced, the configuration at C3 will be determined by the groups around it. Wait, the starting compound is (S) configuration at C5? Or at C3?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the stereocenter is at C5. Because the 3-ketone is at C3, but the 5-methoxy is on C5. So the structure is: 

Carbon 1: CH2CH3 (but wait, hexan-3-one's structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents. The methoxy is on C5, which is the fifth carbon. So the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one: 

So positions:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe it's (S) configuration at C5. So the groups around C5: one CH2 from C4, a methoxy group, and the rest. Let me think about the structure. The C5 is attached to a CH2 group from C4 (which is CH2 connected to C3, the ketone), a methoxy (OCH3), a CH2CH3 (since C5 is connected to C6, which is CH2CH3?), and another CH2 group? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of priorities. For the configuration, the substituents around C5 would be:

- The two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6)
- The methoxy group (OCH3)
- The hydrogen (since it's a chiral center, so maybe a hydrogen is there? Or perhaps not.)

Wait, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the methoxy is on the fifth carbon, which is part of the (CH2)3CH3 group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, that's five carbons after the CO. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Anyway, when it's reduced with LAH, the ketone (C=O) at C3 becomes an alcohol (C-OH) at C3. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, will the configuration change? The starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So when the ketone is reduced, does the configuration at C5 change? Or does the reduction affect another center?

Wait, when we reduce the ketone at C3, that carbon goes from being a carbonyl (sp²) to an alcohol (sp³). So the configuration at C3 was not a stereocenter before (since it was trigonal planar), but after reduction, it becomes a stereocenter with four different groups: the two CH2 groups, the OH group, and the adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the starting material has a stereocenter at C5 (the methoxy), but after reduction, a new stereocenter forms at C3.

Wait, but wait: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So C5 is a stereocenter, but the ketone is at C3. So in the product, when C3 becomes an alcohol, it's a new stereocenter.

So the product will be (something) at C3 and (S) at C5? Or will it be a mixture? Wait, wait LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in this case, it's a ketone. LAH would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Since the ketone is planar, when it's reduced, the OH group can attack from either face. But wait, LAH would typically give a racemic mixture, but wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer. So will the reduction lead to a retention or inversion of configuration, or maybe a new stereocenter?

Wait, the starting material is (S)-configured at C5. The C3 ketone is being reduced. So the product will have an alcohol at C3, which is a new chiral center. So the product will be a single enantiomer at C5, but the C3 will have both R and S forms, leading to a mixture?

Wait, no. Because LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the ketone is planar. Attack can occur from either face, leading to the creation of both enantiomers at the new chiral center (C3). So the product will be a racemic mixture at C3, but the C5 configuration remains the same.

Wait, but the starting material is an enantiomer (S) at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a chiral center, and for each molecule, the configuration at C3 will be a 50-50 mix of R and S because the attack is from both sides. So the product would be a mixture of diastereomers.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product would have two stereocenters: C3 and C5. But since the attack on C3 is from both sides, the C3 would have both configurations, making four possible stereoisomers (but maybe some are the same). Wait, but if the starting material is only (S) at C5, then the product will have C5 as S, and C3 as R and S. So each product would have two stereocenters.

Wait, but actually, for each molecule, when you reduce the ketone, you get a specific configuration at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, but the reduction creates a new stereocenter, the product would be a mixture. Let me think, for each molecule of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the LAH would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, but the reduction process is not stereoselective, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3. So for each molecule, after reduction, you'll have two possible configurations at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

Wait, but the starting material has a single configuration at C5, so the products would have C5 as S, and C3 as R and S. So the product would be a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers: (S, R) and (S, S) at C3 and C5, respectively. Hmm, but wait, wait, that's not correct. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, but the C3 is a new stereocenter. So the product would be a 50:50 mixture of two compounds: one with R at C3 and S at C5, and the other with S at C3 and S at C5. Wait, no. Because the C3 is a new stereocenter, the product would have two stereoisomers: C3 R and C3 S. Each would have the same configuration at C5, which is S.

Wait, but no, because the C5 configuration doesn't change during the reduction. So the product would have two stereoisomers: each with C5 S, but C3 R and S in equal amounts. So when the reaction is 100% complete, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 remains S.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so when you reduce it, you end up with a product that has a new stereocenter which is a racemic mixture. So the product would be a mixture of two diastereomers: S at C5 and R at C3, and S at C5 and S at C3. So two diastereomers, each being a racemic pair? Or is each product a single enantiomer? Because the reduction is from a single stereocenter in the starting material, but the new stereocenter is formed with equal R and S. So the product would have two stereoisomers: 50% (S,R) and 50% (S,S) at C5 and C3, respectively.

Wait, but wait, the C3 is the new stereocenter. So the starting material is (S) at C5, and after reduction, C3 becomes a stereocenter with both R and S configurations. So the product would consist of two enantiomers from each possible configuration at C3. So the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but with C5 still being S.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. For the sake of this problem, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a single product. Wait, no, because LAH is a strong reducing agent and the ketone is planar, so attack can occur from either side, leading to a racemic mixture at the new stereocenter.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer but the new stereocenter is created with equal R and S. So the product would have a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers at C3, while C5 remains S.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider the actual reaction. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol. The C3 will have four different substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), the OH group, and the adjacent groups. So it becomes a chiral center. Since the ketone was planar, the attack by the hydride can be from either side, leading to a racemic mixture at C3. So the product will be a 50:50 mix of the R and S configurations at C3. But the C5 remains S.

So the product from Reaction I is a mixture of two stereoisomers: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with C3 as R and C5 as S, and C3 as S and C5 as S. So two stereoisomers in equal amounts.

Now, moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CH2, I think. So it's a diketone: O=C-CH2-CO-CH3. So when you reduce this with NaBH4, which is a weaker reductant than LAH, but in this case, excess NaBH4 is used. Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce ketones as effectively as LAH, but in this case, it's used in excess. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4. So when treated with NaBH4, each ketone would be reduced. 

Wait, but NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones. So each ketone group would be reduced to an alcohol. So pentane-2,4-dione (structure: CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3) becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 upon reduction. But wait, would it form a diol?

Wait, wait, but when there are two ketone groups, each would be reduced. So pentane-2,4-dione would become 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure is HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH3, so the structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-CH3. Reducing each ketone gives CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait—does NaBH4 reduce both ketones? I thought that in some cases, like 1,2-diketones, which are alpha-diketones, NaBH4 can reduce them, but sometimes under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's more efficient with LAH. But the question states that it's treated with excess NaBH4, so perhaps both ketones are reduced.

So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a diol with two adjacent OH groups? Wait, no, the OH groups are on C2 and C4. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. So two secondary alcohols on the same carbon chain.

Wait, but wait. Pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical, so the reduction would produce a compound that's also symmetrical. So 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So each OH is on C2 and C4, which are symmetric positions.

So the product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is a single compound with an internal plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. So when you run it on a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak, but on a normal-phase column, it would also be a single peak.

Wait, but let me confirm. Pentane-2,4-dione would reduce to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So the product is a single compound, not a mixture. So when the reaction is done, you have just one product from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait. When two identical ketones are present and reduced, does the product have any stereoisomers? For pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is at C2 and C4. Each reduction would create a new stereocenter, but because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups would be mirror images of each other. So the product is a meso compound, meaning it's not chiral. So the product is a single enantiomer, but it's a meso form, so it's achiral. Therefore, it would give one peak on both normal-phase and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. No. Wait, the product is a meso compound, so it has two stereocenters but is achiral. So when you analyze it on a chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, a meso compound would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral. On a normal-phase HPLC, it would also be a single peak because the compound is not chiral and doesn't have any stereoisomers. So Reaction II gives a single product with a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Now, the two reactions are done, and the products are combined. So what are the products?

From Reaction I: a 50:50 mixture of two stereoisomers: (S,R) and (S,S) at C5 and C3, respectively. So two diastereomers, possibly.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, and after reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 remains S. So the products are (S,R) and (S,S) at C5 and C3, respectively.

But wait, the product after Reaction I is a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 is fixed as S. So it's a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers. Each diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers? No, because if it's a racemic mixture at C3, then each C3 configuration would have an R and S, but because C5 is fixed as S, each product is a single stereoisomer. Wait, no. Wait, the product from Reaction I is a mixture of two enantiomers at C3, but in terms of the whole molecule, each has C5 as S and C3 as R or S. So two stereoisomers: (S,R) and (S,S) at C5 and C3. These are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, so the product would be a 1:1 mixture of these two diastereomers. So when combined, the total products would be:

- Product from Reaction I: two diastereomers (each with their own R/S at C3, but same S at C5)
- Product from Reaction II: a single meso compound.

So when the products are combined, the mixture would contain three compounds:

1. From Reaction I: diastereomer 1 (S,R)
2. From Reaction I: diastereomer 2 (S,S)
3. From Reaction II: meso compound (single)

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each at 50% (since it's a racemic mixture at C3). Reaction II produces a single compound. So combining them, you have three different compounds in the mixture.

Wait, but when you run them on HPLC, how many peaks would you see?

On normal-phase HPLC, which separates based on polarity (retention time based on polarity), each distinct compound would show as a peak. So the three compounds would give three peaks on normal-phase.

On chiral HPLC, which is used to separate enantiomers, each enantiomer would give a separate peak. But the meso compound is achiral, so it would give a single peak. The two diastereomers from Reaction I would each have their own peaks on chiral HPLC because they have different configurations. Wait, but wait. The two diastereomers are not enantiomers; they are diastereomers. So in chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, diastereomers would elute at different times because their interactions with the stationary phase (which is chiral) are different. So each diastereomer would be a separate peak on chiral HPLC.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: chiral HPLC is used to separate enantiomers. So if a compound has a plane of symmetry (meso), it would not be separated by chiral HPLC because it's not chiral. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are chiral, so they would each have their own peaks on chiral HPLC. Similarly, the meso compound would be a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Wait, but the two diastereomers from Reaction I are chiral, so each would be a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no: diastereomers are not necessarily mirror images. Let me correct that: the two diastereomers are two different stereoisomers, each with their own configuration. So in chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, diastereomers would have different retention times and would be separated into separate peaks.

Wait, no. Chiral HPLC is used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers are not mirror images, so they would not be separated on a chiral column. Wait, no, that's not correct. Chiral columns separate enantiomers because they have different interactions. Diastereomers have different physical properties and would elute at different times on any type of column, including a chiral one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. If you have two diastereomers, they are already different compounds, so they would separate on any HPLC column, regardless of whether it's chiral or not. So in this case, the two diastereomers from Reaction I would each show as separate peaks on both normal-phase and chiral columns. The meso compound would also show as a single peak on both.

Additionally, the two diastereomers from Reaction I are each chiral, but they are not enantiomers of each other because they are diastereomers. So for each diastereomer, if you run it on a chiral column, each would have its own peak. So the total peaks would be:

- From Reaction I: two diastereomers (each chiral)
- From Reaction II: one meso compound.

So on normal-phase HPLC, you would see three peaks: two for the diastereomers and one for the meso.

On chiral HPLC, each of the two diastereomers would be a single peak because they're not enantiomers. The meso compound would also be a single peak. So total of three peaks on chiral HPLC as well.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

But wait, Reaction I gives two diastereomers, each of which is a chiral compound. So on a normal-phase HPLC, each would be a separate peak. Reaction II gives one meso compound. So total for normal-phase: 2 (from I) +1 (from II) =3 peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer is a separate compound, so they would each elute as a peak. The meso would also elute as a peak. So 3 peaks on both columns.

Wait, but the options don't have 3 on both. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3.

So option D says 3 on both. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let's reevaluate. Did I make a mistake in the number of products from Reaction I?

Wait, Reaction I produces a racemic mixture of the product. So the product is 50% (S,R) and 50% (S,S) at C5 and C3. So the product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers. So when combined with Reaction II's product, which is a single compound, the total compounds are three.

So on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as a separate peak. So three peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer (two) would elute as a separate peak, and the meso as another. So three peaks.

Thus, the answer would be option D:3 peaks in both.


The problem involves two reactions and the analysis of their products using HPLC. Here's the breakdown:

### Reaction I:
**(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one** is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, forming a new stereocenter at C3. The starting material is (S)-configured at C5, and the reduction creates a racemic mixture at C3. Thus, the product is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers: **(S,R)** and **(S,S)** at C5 and C3, respectively.

### Reaction II:
**Pentane-2,4-dione** is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. The diketone is reduced to **2,4-pentanediol**, a meso compound due to its internal plane of symmetry. This product is achiral and forms a single compound.

### Combined Products:
After combining the products from both reactions, the mixture contains:
1. Two diastereomers from Reaction I: **(S,R)** and **(S,S)**.
2. One meso compound from Reaction II.

### HPLC Analysis:
- **Normal-phase HPLC**: Separates compounds based on polarity. The three distinct compounds (two diastereomers and one meso compound) will elute as three separate peaks.
- **Chiral HPLC**: Separates enantiomers. The two diastereomers from Reaction I are chiral and will elute as separate peaks. The meso compound, being achiral, will elute as a single peak. Thus, three peaks are observed.

### Conclusion:
Both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns will show **three peaks** in total.

ANSWER: D
