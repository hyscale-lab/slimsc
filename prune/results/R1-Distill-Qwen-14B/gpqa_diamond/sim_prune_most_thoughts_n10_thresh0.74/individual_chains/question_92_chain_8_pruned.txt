Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound's structure is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question provides some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is usually calculated using bond energies. Oh right, the formula is something like taking the sum of the bond energies of the reactants and subtracting the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of the elements in their standard states and subtracting the bond energies of the molecule.

Wait, maybe I should think about it step by step. The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But in this problem, I don't have the standard enthalpy of formation values; instead, I have bond energies. So I need to use the bond energies to calculate it.

I think the method involves using the concept that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. So the formula is:

ΔHf = [Sum of bond energies of reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, actually, I think it's the opposite. Because when bonds break, you're adding energy (endothermic), and when bonds form, you release energy (exothermic). So for the formation reaction, you're starting from elements (like CO2 and H2O for combustion, but here it's about forming the molecule from its constituent atoms).

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formation of the molecule from its constituent atoms. So, the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (which are the elements) minus the energy released when the bonds in the product (the molecule) form.

Alternatively, another approach is: the enthalpy of the molecule is equal to the sum of the enthalpy of atomization of all the atoms minus the sum of all the bond energies within
