Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is about.

Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm. So I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- I think. Wait, no, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, let's think. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. Then when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and then PO4^3- (phosphate).

So the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So these are two different salts that will contribute to the phosphate species in solution.

Let me think about this. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (I think). So when it dissolves, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water of crystallization, but that's part of the formula, so the sodium comes out as ions). So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So the concentration of orthophosphate ions in solution comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Hmm, perhaps orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, that's not the case here. Because in solution, phosphate is in various forms depending on pH. So we have a buffer here because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4, but it can also donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait,
