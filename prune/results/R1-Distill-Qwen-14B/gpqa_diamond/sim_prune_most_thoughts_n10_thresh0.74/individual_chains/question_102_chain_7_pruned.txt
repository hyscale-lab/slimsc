Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read it again and take notes. 

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, CBA is a strong promoter, I think. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor could be expressed as a separate protein after the ligand? Or maybe they're co-expressed using different mechanisms.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Oh, right, so without Cre, that stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. So, the ligand and receptor are each under their own regulatory elements but in the same vector.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The total proteins show actin loading, so the blot is working. So the question is why, after breeding mice and using SOX10-Cre, there's no green signal. Green is from eGFP, which is on the receptor.

Wait, mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Cre would recombine the loxP sites. Let me think about the construct. 

In the vector, the ligand is first. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The stop cassette with loxP would be after the ligand ORF. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has an IRES upstream. The IRES would help in the expression of the receptor, which is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it would excise that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor.

Wait, but when they used a bicistronic vector, both ligand and receptor should be expressed. But wait, the setup is that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. Hmm, IRES-driven expression might be in a different tissue or under different conditions.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So perhaps the ligand is expressed under CBA, and the receptor is co-expressed using the IRES. So when they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is a tissue-specific Cre, it would activate both the ligand and receptor.

But the problem is that in the offspring, under the confocal, there's no green signal. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

What could cause that? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I'm not sure how that affects expression here. If they were paracrine, maybe one is secreted and the other is on the surface, but if the construct is in the same cell, they might be autocrine. Not sure this explains the lack of eGFP.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, so no fluorescence. But why would the Cre cause that? Or maybe the construct isn't properly processed. But then why would the ligand's mCherry show up? Because the question says they used the antibodies on Western blot. So if the ligand is expressed (mCherry detected), but the receptor isn't (no eGFP), then maybe the receptor isn't getting expressed.

Option C: Missing enhancer for ligand and receptor expression. Without an enhancer, they wouldn't be expressed. But the vector uses a strong promoter (CBA for ligand, and IRES for receptor), so maybe in the presence of Cre, the enhancer is needed. Wait, but in the vector, if the promoter is strong, maybe an enhancer isn't the main issue. Or perhaps the Cre isn't recombining correctly, so the constructs aren't being expressed.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal. Or maybe the stop cassette wasn't excised correctly, so the eGFP isn't made.

Wait, in the vector setup: ligand is first, followed by a stop cassette (loxP), then mCherry
