Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It usually involves 1,5-dienes converting into another 1,5-diene, but with the groups shifting positions. The reaction typically forms a more substituted double bond because of Zaitsev's rule.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a bridge with two carbons and another with two, connected by a bridge of one carbon. So the structure is a norbornene derivative. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 2, and an azabicyclo suggests a nitrogen atom in the ring somewhere.

Wait, the numbering is 1S,4R. So the molecule is norbornene, with substituents at positions 2 and 5. The 2-azabicyclo part might mean that one of the bridgehead carbons has a nitrogen. Wait, no, the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me draw it out mentally. The bicyclo system has seven carbons. The bridgeheads are carbons 1, 4, and 5? Or maybe 1, 4, and another. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has bridgeheads at positions 1, 4, and 5, I think. No, wait, the structure is such that there are two bridges: one of two carbons and another of two, and the third bridge is one carbon. So the bridgehead positions are 1 and 4, connected by a bridge of one carbon, and then the other bridges are longer.

So the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So at position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), no, wait, it's 2-vinyl, so a CH2CH2 group attached. But wait, the actual structure would have a double bond in the vinyl group. So the vinyl group is =CH2 attached to position 2.

Now, the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene. So in this molecule, where is the diene? Let me think. The bicyclo structure has a double bond at position 5 (hept-5-ene), so that's one double bond. The vinyl group adds another double bond. So the structure is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. Wait, but the Cope rearrangement requires a conjugated diene, perhaps as a 1,5-diene.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a conjugated diene system that can undergo [3,3] shift. Let me think about the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 maybe. Then the vinyl group is at position 2, so that's another double bond. So the two double bonds are not conjugated. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the molecule
