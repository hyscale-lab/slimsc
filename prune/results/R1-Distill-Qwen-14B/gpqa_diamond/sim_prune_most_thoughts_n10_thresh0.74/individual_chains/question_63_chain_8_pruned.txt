Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using rotation-vibration models. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model or the non-rigid rotor model. 

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given as A, B, C, D with specific values.

First, I think I should understand the energy levels in this model. I recall that for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the problem mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, I'm guessing that the molecule needs to transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, in such models, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So, the next state might involve a change in either the vibrational or rotational quantum number.

But wait, the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' The lowest possible energy next state would probably be the next vibrational state, because vibrational energy transitions are higher in energy than rotational ones, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition from the ground vibrational state with some rotational energy to a higher vibrational state with minimal rotational change. Or perhaps the model considers the energy levels as a combination of both, so the next state could be the first excited vibrational state, or the next rotational state.

Wait, the question specifies that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the lowest energy transition would be the smallest possible energy increment, which for vibrations is typically smaller than that for rotations. Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ħω. For rotations, the energy is ( J (J+1) ) / (2I) where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia. So, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1, for example, would be something like (1*2)/(2I) - 0 = 1/(I). Let's compute that.

Wait, but I think the vibrational energy spacing (ΔE_vib) is ħω, and the rotational energy spacing (ΔE_rot) is on the order of ħ²/(2I) for each step. But which is smaller? Let me compute.

Given the data:
Mx = 20 amu
My = 2 amu
Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, the moment of inertia I for the molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So, first compute μ.

The masses are given in amu, so I need to convert them to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So, mass of X: Mx = 20 amu = 2
