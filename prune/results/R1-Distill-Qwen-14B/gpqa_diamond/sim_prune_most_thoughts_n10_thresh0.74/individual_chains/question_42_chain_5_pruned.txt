Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me information about three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But wait, TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by the variations in the timing of transits when a planet passes in front of its star. So, these planets are discovered through that method, but how does that affect the problem? Maybe the method isn't directly relevant here, so perhaps I can set that aside for now.

The problem gives me the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 and Planet2 have a ratio of about 1.4, meaning Planet2's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet1. Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet3 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet2. Wait, no, wait—equilibrium temperature is usually inversely related to the distance from the star. Because the temperature depends on how much light they receive, which depends on the distance squared. So, a higher temperature would mean they're closer to the star.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature also depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo. Oh, wait the albedo is given as 0.3 for all three, same as Earth. So albedo is fixed here. So the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the temperature is proportional to sqrt(L) / D^(1/2), because T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4) times sqrt( (1-a) ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature equation is:

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) * D^(-1/2). Since the albedo a is the same
