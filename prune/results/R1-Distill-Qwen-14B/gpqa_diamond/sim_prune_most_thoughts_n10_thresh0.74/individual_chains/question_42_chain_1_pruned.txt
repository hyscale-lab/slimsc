Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, their masses, and the albedo. The question is about finding the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, wait: actually, the problem states the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, so T1 is 1.4 times T2? Or is it T2 over T1? Hmm, let me read again. It says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So I think that's T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3.

Wait no, wait, no. Wait, the way it's worded: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So it's T1 divided by T2? Or the other way around? Hmm. Well, if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then T2 would be T1 / 1.4. Alternatively, if it's T2 over T1, then T2 is 1.4 times T1. I'll have to figure that out as I go.

Also, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15, meaning M1 is 15% more massive than M2. Similarly, M2/M3 = 1.35, so M2 is 35% more than M3. So M3 is M2 divided by 1.35, which would be about 74% of M2.

But wait, how does mass relate to orbital period? Well, Kepler's third law
