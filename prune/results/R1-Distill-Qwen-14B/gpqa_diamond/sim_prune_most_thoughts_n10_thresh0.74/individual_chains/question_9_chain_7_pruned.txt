Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think this through.

First, what is C3h symmetry? I remember that the notation for molecular symmetry includes a letter (like C, D, etc.) and a subscript. The C stands for cyclic, and the number is the order of rotation. So C3 would mean the molecule can be rotated by 120 degrees around an axis, and it would look the same. The h in C3h probably refers to a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the h stands for horizontal, so it's a symmetry that includes a horizontal mirror plane plus the rotational symmetry. Or maybe it's the combination of rotation and a horizontal mirror.

So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a threefold rotation axis and also a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's the combination of C3 and a horizontal mirror, which would imply certain symmetry elements.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
Option C: triisopropyl borate.
Option D: quinuclidine.

I need to figure out each molecule's symmetry.

Let's start with triisopropyl borate, option C. Triisopropyl borate has a structure where a boron atom is connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is a symmetrical substituent. The molecule is planar around the boron, right? Because each isopropyl is the same and arranged symmetrically. If each substituent is arranged 120 degrees apart around the central atom, that would give a C3 rotational symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Wait, for C3h, the molecule must have a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, so it's
