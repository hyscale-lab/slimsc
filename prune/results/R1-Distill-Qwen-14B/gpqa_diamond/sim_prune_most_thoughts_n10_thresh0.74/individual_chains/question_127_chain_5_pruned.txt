Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain substituents, they can undergo some kind of rearrangement. Oh wait, it's probably a Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe a different type of pericyclic reaction. Wait, no, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. But in this case, heating might cause a different kind of reaction.

Wait, wait, the molecule in question is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw the structure. Nona means nine carbons in a chain. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because it's nona-2,6-diene. So the positions are 2 and 6: 

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Wait, perhaps I should number from the other end. Let me think: nona is nine carbons, so 1 to 9. The double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7 (since double bonds are between 2 and 3, and 6 and 7). So the structure would be like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH3?
