Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions and isotopes. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm. Let's start by trying to figure out what X could be. Since X reacts with a liquid Y to produce a gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. So W's molecule must be something where protons equal neutrons. Let me think, what gases fit that?

Wait, if a molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like CO2? No, that's not right. Let's see: for example, water (H2O) has H (1 proton each) and O (8 protons). So H2O would have 2*(1) + 8 = 10 protons. Neutrons would be 8 for oxygen and 0 for H, so 8. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe something like NH3? But that would be 14 (N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons; H has 1 each. So NH3 is 14 protons, 3 H's with 1 each, so 17 protons total. Neutrons: 7 (from N) + 3*(0) =7. Oh wait, that's not equal. So protons are 17, neutrons 7. No match.

Wait another approach: if the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, perhaps it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has same protons and neutrons. Like O2? Oxygen has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O2 molecule would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, same number. Or maybe O3? No, same idea. So W is O2 or O3? Or maybe H2O, but earlier that didn't fit.

Wait
