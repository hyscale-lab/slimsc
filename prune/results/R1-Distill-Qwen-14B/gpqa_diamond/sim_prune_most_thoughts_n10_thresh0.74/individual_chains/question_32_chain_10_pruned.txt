Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then it's Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So, first I need to figure out the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I remember that each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are about 939 MeV/c², but wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, maybe for calculation purposes, it's okay to approximate them as roughly similar, but perhaps I should just use the exact values or the average? No, better to use the exact. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is:

Mass (protons) = 3 * 938.272 MeV
Mass (neutrons) = 3 * 939.565 MeV

Wait, but wait, maybe I need to calculate the total mass correctly. Let me compute that.

3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = let's see, 938.272 *3 = 2814.816 MeV
3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Total mass = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I should consider the binding energy because when nucleons come together, the mass might be less due to the mass defect. Oh wait, but the problem probably expects me to use the sum of the individual rest masses. Because in the absence of specific binding energy data, it's a common approximation. Alternatively, maybe the mass of the nucleus is given, but I don't have that. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give me any data about the nucleus's mass, so perhaps I should proceed with the sum of the individual nucleons' masses.

So, proceeding with the total rest mass energy (m0c²) as 3*(proton mass + neutron mass)/2? Wait, no, that's not right. Each proton and neutron is counted separately. So protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV, neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. So total is 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, but wait again. I think I'm making a mistake here. Wait, because the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus is different from the sum of individual nucleons. But since the question doesn't give me that data, perhaps I should proceed with the sum. Alternatively, maybe I should just use the molar mass or the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 g/mol, but wait, that's for one mole. So for a single nucleus, the mass would be 6.014
