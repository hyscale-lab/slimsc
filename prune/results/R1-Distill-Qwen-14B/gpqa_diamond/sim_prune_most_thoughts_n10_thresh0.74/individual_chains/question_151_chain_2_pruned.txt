Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait a second—those numbers are just the components of a vector, right? So the state vector is a 3-dimensional vector, which makes sense since the observable matrix P is 3x3.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable will yield 0. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable (operator) matrix. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the expectation value is found by the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. But no, the probability is related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let's think.

The probability of getting a specific eigenvalue (say, 0) when measuring the observable is the sum of the squares of the amplitudes of the state in the eigenspace corresponding to that eigenvalue.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: in the case where the observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, which it should be since it's an observable. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Looking at P:

The elements are real except for any fractions, but the entries are all real. So the conjugate transpose would be the same as the transpose. So let me check if P equals P^T.

Looking at the first row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. The first column is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], so that's good. Second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], so the second column is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. Wait, the second column is the same as the second row? Yes, because the matrix is symmetric. Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], and third column is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So yes, P is symmetric, hence Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real.

So the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of P. I need to find the eigenvalues of P to see if 0 is one of them. Because if 0 is an eigenvalue, then the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude associated with that eigenvector.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value, but that's not directly giving the probability. Wait, no—the expectation value is the average outcome, but the probability is linked to the eigenvectors.

Hmm, perhaps I should
