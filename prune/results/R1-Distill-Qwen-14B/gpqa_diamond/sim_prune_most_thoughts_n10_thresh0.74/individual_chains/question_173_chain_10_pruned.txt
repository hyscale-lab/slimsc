Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. Let me think about what I know.

The problem states that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE.

Wait, right. The uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I guess we'll take the equality as the minimum case, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

Oh wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Its value is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes, in these calculations, people approximate it as around 1e-34 for simplicity. I'll proceed with that approximation.

So from Δx * Δp = ħ/2, I can solve for Δp. Let's plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh, wait, nanometers to meters. 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 m = 1e-10 m.

So, Δp = (ħ)/(2Δx). Plugging in the numbers: ħ is approx 1e-34 J·s, and Δx is 1e-10 m. So Δp = (1e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = (1e-34)/(2e-10) = (1/(2)) * 1e-24 kg·m/s. Because J·s is kg·m²/s, and when you divide by m, you get kg·m/s. So that gives Δp approximately equal to 0.5e-24 kg·m/s, which is 5e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 1e-34 divided by (2 * 1e-10) is 1e-34 / 2e-10 = (1/2) * 1e-24 = 5e-25. Yep, that's right.

Now, how does this relate to the uncertainty in energy ΔE? Hmm, I think the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in momentum, because momentum and energy are related. Since the electron is moving, its kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which depends on the uncertainty in p. Let me think about the relationship.

Using the formula for kinetic energy: KE = p²/(2m). So if p has an uncertainty Δp, then ΔKE ≈ (2p Δp)/(2m) )? Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me be precise.

The kinetic energy is KE = p²/(2m). So the differential d(KE) would be (2p dp)/(2m) )= p dp/m. Wait, no, differential of p²/(2m) is (2p dp)/(2m) )= p dp/m. So d(KE) = (p/m) dp. Hmm, but that assumes p is large compared to Δp, but maybe in this case, we're looking for an order of magnitude estimate.

So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. Because d(KE) = (p/m) dp. So if Δp is the uncertainty in p, then the uncertainty in KE is approximately (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, I don't know the exact value of p. I know the speed v is given. The momentum p is m*v. So p = m_e * v.

The mass of the electron m_e is approximately 9.109e-31 kg. So let's compute p: m_e = 9.109e-31 kg, v=2e8 m/s. So p = 9.109e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 9.109e-31 * 2e8 = 1.8218e-22 kg·m/s.

So now, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But p/m is (m_e*v)/(m_e) ) = v. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

Wait, that's a neat simplification. Because (p/m) is v, so ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So plugging in the numbers: v is 2e8 m/s, Δp is 5e-25 kg·m/s. So ΔE ≈ 2e8 * 5e-25 = 1e-16 J.

Wait, 2e8 *5e-25 is 10e-17, which is 1e-16 J. So the uncertainty in energy would be approximately 1e-16 J.

Looking at the options, option D is ~10^-16 J. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Did I consider all the proper approximations?

Another approach: using the uncertainty principle. The minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). So for Δx = 1e-10 m, Δp ≈ 1e-34/(2e-10) = 5e-25 kg·m/s as before.

Then, the kinetic energy uncertainty ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m). Because KE is p²/(2m), so the uncertainty would be (Δp)^2/(2m). Let me compute that.

(5e-25)^2 = 25e-50. 25e-50 / (2 * 9.1e-31) = (25e-50)/(1.82e-30) ) = (25 / 1.82) * 1e-20. 25/1.82 is approximately 13.73. So 13.73e-20 is about 1.37e-19 J.

Wait, hold on. That's different from the previous approach. Now I'm getting around 1e-19 J, which would correspond to option C.

Hmm, why the discrepancy? Where did I go wrong?

Ah, maybe the correct approach is to compute ΔE using the uncertainty in p, not via the derivative approach. Because when you have Δp, the uncertainty in energy is (Δp)^2/(2m), because E = p²/(2m). So the standard deviation in E would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). So perhaps the second approach is more accurate.

Wait, but in the first approach, I assumed ΔE ≈ v * Δp. But where did that come from? Let me think. The first approach was taking the differential of E = (p^2)/(2m), which is dE = (p/m) dp. So if
