Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read it again.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute that for each part of the operator.

First, let me break down the operator. 10σz + 5σx. So the expectation value is the sum of 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩.

I think I can compute each expectation separately and then add them together.

Starting with the σz part. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy. σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

The state vector ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨σz⟩, it should be |0.5|^2 times (+1) plus |√3/2|^2 times (-1).

Let me compute that. |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |√3/2|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5. Multiply by 10: 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. I think σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So I can't directly use the same approach as σz.

Wait, the expectation value of σx can be found using ψ. Let me write ψ in terms of components. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, actually, it's a column vector, so 0.5 in the first component, sqrt(3)/2 in the second.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the formula for expectation value of σx. I remember that σx can be represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so when I multiply it by ψ, I get a new vector, and then take the inner product with ψ.

Alternatively, I can write ψ as a column vector: [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Now, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx * ψ would be [ (1* sqrt(3)/2), (1 * 0.5) ]^T, because the first component is 0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2), and the second component is 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2).

So σx|ψ> is [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Then, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ψ† σx ψ. So it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Calculating that: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) =
