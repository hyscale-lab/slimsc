Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm, I need to figure out what X is. Let's go through each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. So, they react violently, releasing gas W. The gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about gases that have this property. The number of protons is the atomic number, and neutrons would be the atomic mass minus protons. For a molecule, maybe it's a diatomic gas because it's released as a gas.

Wait, if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in each atom. Wait, no, the molecule as a whole has the same number of neutrons and protons. Or maybe each atom in the molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons?

Wait, let me think. For example, if the molecule is H2, that's 2 atoms of hydrogen each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. What about another gas? Like O2? Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom. Oh! So each O atom has 8 protons (atomic number 8) and 8 neutrons (mass number 16). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for O2, the molecule has 2 atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the total protons would be 16, and neutrons would be 16. So equal numbers. So W could be O2. But wait, oxygen is a common gas, but under what reaction conditions would it be released?

Wait, but another possibility is CO2? No, because CO2 has a molecule with different numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about other gases. Maybe another diatomic gas. Let's see, what about Cl2? Each Cl atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons (since Cl has two main isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37). Wait, but then Cl2 would have 34 protons (17 each) and 36 neutrons (18 each). Or wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Let me compute:

If the molecule is O2, each O has 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons (assuming O-16), so O2 has 16 neutrons. Then 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So W is O2.

But then, what's the reaction that produces O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2? No, because CO2 has a different structure. Or maybe H2?

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is approximately 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, that's near the melting point of some substances. Let me think: water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 degrees C. So 277 K is 4°C. Hmm. What substance melts near there? Maybe something like ice or another crystalline solid? Or perhaps another solid. Wait, another possibility: maybe B is a solid with a higher melting point. Wait, wait, 277 K is about 4°C. What solid melts around that temperature? Maybe something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the solid is something like sodium hydroxide
