Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

First, the setup: They're tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and giving them to mice orally. So, the mice are getting these proteins via their stomach, right? Then, they're using in vivo imaging to see what happens. From the imaging, they saw that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so maybe the proteins didn't survive that. But some of them made it past the stomach and got stuck in the intestinal mucus. Then, these reached the secondary lymphoid organs, like the Peyer's patches. So the Peyer patches are where they found the fluorescent spots.

They isolated the proliferating cells there and looked at the variable heavy chain genes. And these genes showed high variability. I remember that variable regions in antibodies are really diverse because of something called V(D)J recombination. But wait, what's happening here?

So, the process in question is about the variability in the heavy chain genes. Somatic hypermutation (option A) occurs after B cells have already been activated. It's a process that introduces point mutations, increasing diversity in the variable region, especially during the germinal center reactions. But if this is happening in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, maybe it's related to generating diverse B cell receptors.

Option B is complement activation. That's more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not about gene variability. So probably not this one.

Option C is class switching recombination. That's when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. It's more about the type of antibody, not the diversity of the antigen-binding site. So maybe not C.

Option D is V(D)J recombination. I think V(D)J is for the initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's how the variable regions are first formed, combining V, D, and J segments. But wait, this is after the B cell is mature but before activation, right? Or does this happen during the initial stages?

Wait, but in this case, the cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches. So I'm thinking about secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses are initiated. If the GFP proteins are getting taken up and presented, maybe the B cells are activating there. In the immune response, when the B cells are activated, they undergo somatic hypermutation to increase their affinity for the antigen. Because the variable regions are being hypermutated, that increases diversity, leading to higher-affinity antibodies.

But wait, the question says that the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. So if it's during the initial setup of the B cell receptor, that's VDJ. But VDJ happens in the bone marrow, during B cell maturation. So the B cells in the Peyer's patches have already undergone that. So what happens later?

Ah, I think when the B cell is activated by an antigen, especially in the germinal centers, it undergoes somatic hypermutation. This process creates more diversity, allowing for a better immune response. So the high variability in the variable regions would be due to somatic hypermutation.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A. Because the cells are proliferating and their variable regions are changing, leading to more variability.

Wait, but another thought: when the rotavirus proteins are taken up, perhaps the B cells are presenting them and then undergoing their own mutations. So the variable regions are being hypermutated, which is somatic hypermutation.

Alternatively, could it be VDJ? No, because VDJ is during development. The cells in the secondary lymphoid organs have already gone through that. So I think the process is somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed to survive stomach acid and intestinal mucus, eventually reaching the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer patches. Fluorescent cells in the Peyer patches are isolated, and their variable heavy chain genes show high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the options are analyzed:

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where B cells undergo point mutations in their variable regions to increase diversity and affinity for antigens. This aligns with the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes in the proliferating B cells in the Peyer patches.

- **Option B (complement activation):** This process involves the complement system attacking pathogens and is unrelated to the variability in antibody variable regions. It is not relevant here.

- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This process changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.

- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This process generates initial diversity in B cell receptors during early development in the bone marrow. However, it occurs before the B cells reach secondary lymphoid organs and is not responsible for the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in secondary lymphoid tissues like the Peyer patches. This process increases the diversity and affinity of B cell receptors in response to antigen exposure.

Answer: A
