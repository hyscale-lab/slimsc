Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me see. The question is about a small peptidic compound that has been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum shows something unusual. The user says that all the peaks look as expected except for two that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what you'd expect. So together, it's like one proton. But why are they split into two?

The user also mentions that based on the coupling pattern, spin-spin coupling isn't the reason. Spin-spin coupling usually causes splitting into multiple peaks, but in this case, the two peaks are from the same proton. Hmm, maybe it's something else causing them. Oh wait, maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomers? Because enantiomers would have the same NMR shifts, but wait, no, that's not right. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So if they were enantiomers, the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton. So that probably isn't the issue here.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So it's not due to enantiomers because those would look the same. Maybe it's diastereomers? Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR peaks would split. But wait, the integral is adding up to one proton, meaning each peak is integrating to about 0.5 each. Oh wait, diastereomers would have the same number of protons in each environment. So each diastereomer would have one alpha proton, but if you have a mixture, each peak would integrate to 0.5 each if they're present equally. But the question says the two peaks have roughly equal integrals, adding to 1H. So that makes sense if there's a 50-50 mixture of two diastereomers. Each would contribute half a proton. So that could be an option, D.

Alternatively, what about the LC-MS part? The
