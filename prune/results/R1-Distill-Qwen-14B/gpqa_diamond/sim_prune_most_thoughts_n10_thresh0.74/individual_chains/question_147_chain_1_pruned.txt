Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let's see, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Hmm, I remember that protons and antiprotons annihilating each other often produce other particles. But wait, here it's creating these A particles, both positively and negatively charged. So I guess each A must have a charge of +1 and -1, but I'm not too sure about that right now.

The question says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, no, wait—no, the antiproton is slowly moving. So the initial setup is that the proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe both are moving? Hmm, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its velocity is not too high, so relativistic effects are minimal. Or perhaps I should consider them as the initial state with some kinetic energy.

Wait, but the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. So the rest mass energy of particle A is 300 MeV. I'm trying to find the velocity of particle A after the annihilation. The options are all velocities as a fraction of c, so it's a relativistic problem.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are important. The proton and antiproton have the same mass, right? So the rest mass energy for each is about 938 MeV, I think. So combined, that's about 1876 MeV.

In the annihilation, they produce two A+ and two A− particles. So four particles in total. Each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass energy after the reaction is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

Wait, but wait. If the initial rest mass is 1876 MeV, and the final rest mass is 1200 MeV, then there's a lot of energy left over. So this energy must go into kinetic energy of the A particles, or perhaps some photons? Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention photons; maybe it's just considering the kinetic energy.

But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial kinetic energy isn't too large. Hmm, but how do I approach this?

Let me think about the initial frame. If the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial total momentum is small. Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is much less than that of a relativistic particle.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. So maybe the problem is considering the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity. Or vice versa.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the initial system's center of mass is not the lab frame. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame, considering that the initial particles (proton and antiproton) have some kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible, so the initial energy is approximately 2 * m_p c
