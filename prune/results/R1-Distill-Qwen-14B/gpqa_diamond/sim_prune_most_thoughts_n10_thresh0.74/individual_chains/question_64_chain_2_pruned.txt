Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, it's about heating a mixture of salts and then analyzing the gases that form. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says that salts A and B are equimolar and weigh 7.20 grams in total. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, the gases produced are passed through some tubes. Tube 1 has Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, and tube 3 has red-hot copper. The weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g respectively. Tube 2's weight didn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

Wait, so what's happening here. When salts are heated, they might decompose. The gases formed could be various things—like CO2, H2O, maybe something else. The tubes are probably for detecting these gases.

Let me think about the setup:

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, I think. Or maybe it reacts with certain gases. If a gas reacts with Mg(ClO4)2, what could it be? Well, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, but it can also react with moisture. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is used in drying because it's deliquescent. So if there's water vapor, it might get absorbed. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is itself a hydrate sometimes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it reacts with acid gases. Hmm, perhaps SO3 or something similar? Or maybe it's reacting with NH3 or something. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is acidic? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps if the gas is HCl, but I don't think so because Mg(ClO4)2 plus HCl would produce MgCl2, HClO4? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO2. But Mg(ClO4)2 is a magnesium salt; perhaps it doesn't react with CO2. Wait, but maybe the gas is something like water vapor. If the salts decompose to produce water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. That makes sense because Mg(ClO4)2 is used as a drying agent. So if the gas is H2O, then the increase in tube 1's weight is due to water being absorbed.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2 and there's no change in weight, that suggests that the gas doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. For example, CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But if the weight didn't change, perhaps the gas didn't react. Alternatively, maybe the gas was H2O again, but H2O is a liquid at room temperature (since the setup is without cooling), but if it's passed through a solution, maybe it dissolves but doesn't react
