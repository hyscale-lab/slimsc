Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's read through the question again carefully.

The problem states that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, wait, actually, it says it's proportional, so I need to normalize it, right? Because any quantum state vector has to be normalized to 1.

Then, the question is about measuring the probability of the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by Aij where Aij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, this matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states.

First, let's think about the operator. The matrix A for a two-level system would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, Aij is hbar/2, else zero. So, this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, what's the significance of this operator? Oh right, this is the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) times that.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin states along the x-axis. So, when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes correspond to the eigenvalues of A, which would be plus and minus hbar/2. Because the eigenvalues of X are ±1, so when multiplied by hbar/2, they become ±hbar/2.

But wait, the problem is phrased a bit differently. It says "the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is A". So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probability of measuring each would be the square of the amplitude of each component in the state |alpha> when expressed in the |+x> and |-x> basis.

Alternatively, since the operator A's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, we can compute the probability by projecting |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates.

But before that, I need to find the normalized state |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, find the normalization factor.

So, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> to find the normalization.

The inner product is (1 - i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. So for each term, the coefficient is c1 = (1+i) and c2 = (2 -i).

So |c1|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2, and |c2|^2 is (
