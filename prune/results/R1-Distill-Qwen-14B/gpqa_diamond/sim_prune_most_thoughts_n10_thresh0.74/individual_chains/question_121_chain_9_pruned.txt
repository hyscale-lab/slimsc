Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out what product forms when a specific epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi. Let's break it down.

First, the starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane. Wait, bicyclo [4.1.0] heptane... I think that's a norbornane structure. Norbornane is bicyclic with two rings, right? The 7-oxa means there's an oxygen in the ring, making it an epoxide. So the structure is a norbornene oxide.

The molecule has substituents at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Wait, the formula is 1,3,4-trimethyl, so methyl groups are on carbons 1, 3, and 4. And 6S indicates the configuration there. But wait, the bicyclo numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me sketch this.

Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but this is bicyclo[4.1.0], so it's a different arrangement. Oh, wait, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a seven-membered ring with bridges of 4, 1, and 0. Hmm, maybe it's a bicyclo system where one bridge is longer. Maybe it's similar to norbornane but with a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The 7-oxa means that two carbons are connected by an oxygen, forming an epoxide. So in the bicyclo structure, two adjacent carbons have an oxygen bridge, making an epoxide ring.

Now, when epoxides react with organocuprates like Me2CuLi, it's a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically attack the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. But wait, the question says that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. Oh right, so in the reaction, the methyl group from the cuprate will add to the less substituted or less hindered carbon of the epoxide.

But wait, there's also something about inversion of configuration. The question states that in dis
