Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the ability to detect a star depends on its apparent brightness, right? Because a brighter star (lower magnitude number) is easier to observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detectable by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 mag. Because if a star is brighter than 16, both can see it. Wait, no—wait, ESPRESSO can go up to 17, meaning it can see stars as faint as 17. So for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17? No, wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Oh wait, no. Wait, the V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star's V mag is brighter (lower) than 17, then it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Hmm, wait the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so that would include all stars with V < 17 mag. Because brighter means lower magnitude. So for ESPRESSO, the limit is V < 17.

Similarly, for HIRES, the limit is V < 16. So a star needs to have V < 16 to be observed by HIRES. So any star that's brighter than V=16 can be seen by both, but wait, because ESPRESSO can go fainter. Wait, I think I've got this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed"—so that's any star with V <17. Because higher magnitude is fainter. So ESPRESSO can handle up to 17 mag. HIRES can handle up to 16 mag. So any star with V mag <=16 can be
