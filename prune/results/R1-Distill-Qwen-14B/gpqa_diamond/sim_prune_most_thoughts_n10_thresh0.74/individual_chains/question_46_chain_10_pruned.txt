Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions, right? Metathesis breaks and reforms double bonds. So, the question is about how many possible products we get when this specific alkene is treated with Grubbs catalyst, not counting ethene.

Let me think. The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what does that structure look like? Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, let me visualize: pent means five carbons. 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. 3-methyl means a methyl branch on C3.

So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Numbering from the double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So, carbon chain is 1,2,3,4,5. Carbon 1 is double bonded to 2. Then carbon 3 is CH(CH3). So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would make it five carbons. Let me count: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). So yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but wait the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃? Hmm, no, wait. Let's count the carbons: 1 (CH₂), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH₂), 5 (CH3). So that's five carbons in total. So the structure is correct.

But wait, the molecule is racemic, meaning it's a 50-5
