Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting because in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. So how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Let me recall what Maxwell's equations are. There are four of them, right? I think they describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and how they're generated by charges and currents.

The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This relates the electric field to the charge density.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0. This one states that there are no isolated magnetic charges, so the divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This connects changing magnetic fields to electric fields.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). This links magnetic fields to currents and changing electric fields.

So in our universe, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, holds because we don't have isolated magnetic monopoles. But in this alternative universe, they can have isolated North or South poles. That means the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore because there would be magnetic charges.

Wait, right. If a magnet can have isolated poles, that implies the existence of magnetic monopoles. So the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's law for E includes electric charge.

So looking at the options, the first equation (Gauss's Law for E) wouldn't change. But the second equation (Gauss's Law for B) would change. So which options involve changes to that?

The question is, which of Maxwell's equations are different in this universe? Because in our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B=0. If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would become ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

Wait, but the question is about which equations are different. So equation 2 is definitely different. Are there any other equations that would change?

Let me think about Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Faraday's Law? Faraday's Law is about the curl of E being related to the time derivative of B. I don't think the existence of magnetic monopoles affects this directly, unless there's a dual version. Oh wait, I remember that with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So Faraday's Law would have a source term, similar to how Ampère's Law includes a current term.

Wait, no, Faraday's Law in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Let me think. In our universe, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic charges, would there be an additional term here? Alternatively, perhaps the equation for the divergence of E and the curl of B would change.

Wait, maybe I should think about duality transformations. In a universe with magnetic mon
