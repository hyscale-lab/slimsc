Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? So the main way the Sun produces energy is via the pp chain, where protons fuse into helium. The pp-III branch is one of the steps, maybe involving boron or something like that. Oh right, in the pp-III branch, a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton to become carbon-9, which then decays into lithium-7 and a positron or something like that. And in that process, neutrinos are emitted.

So, if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, that would affect the production of those specific neutrinos. Neutrinos come from various sources in the Sun. The main ones are probably the pp chain and the CNO cycle. But the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stopped, others remain as they were. So other reactions, like pp-I and pp-II, and the CNO reactions, are still happening.

Wait, but how do the neutrinos' energies relate to the reactions? Neutrinos produced in the pp chain have certain energy ranges. For example, the Beryllium-7 neutrinos (like in the pep branch) are lower energy, around a couple of MeV, while the CNO neutrinos are higher, maybe around 15 MeV. But wait, the question is about 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. That's in the lower end, so maybe from the pp chain.

In the pp chain, the dominant neutrinos are the ones from the pep reaction (pep branch) which produce lower energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV. Wait, but 700 keV is 0.7 MeV. So if the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher than that, stopping the pp-III would affect the higher energy part of the neutrino spectrum.

Wait, let me think about the neutrino energies from the pp chain. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the Beryllium-7 neutrinos (which are the most numerous), and then the Boron-8 neutrinos. Oh, wait, the pp chain produces Boron-8, which then decays into Carbon-9, which then emits a positron and becomes Lithium-7, and in that process emits a neutrino. Those are the high-energy neutrinos, about 15 MeV, I think. Or maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

No, wait, the Be-7 neutrinos are from the pep branch, which is a part of the pp chain. The Be-7 nucleus captures a proton to make Carbon-8, which then emits a positron and a neutrino. The neutrino from that is around 1.4 MeV. But the neutrinos from the Boron-8 decay (pp-III branch) are higher energy, maybe around 15 MeV? Or wait, maybe that's the CNO cycle. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the Boron-8 neutrinos are the highest energy ones, around 15 MeV, but I
