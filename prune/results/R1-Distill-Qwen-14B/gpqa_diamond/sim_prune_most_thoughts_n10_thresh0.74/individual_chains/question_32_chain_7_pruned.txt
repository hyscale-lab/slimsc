Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the question is about finding the energy of the collider. I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations. But wait, which one exactly? Oh, right, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times its rest mass energy, E = γmc². And gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Given v = 0.96c, so let's compute gamma first. Let's plug that in. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 ). Simplify that, the c^2 cancels, so it's 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2). Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96. Let me compute that again. 96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is indeed 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, that's an approximation. Let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28, which is 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next step: find the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass of Li-6 is needed in some unit. Since energy is given in GeV, we probably need the rest mass energy in GeV. So I think the mass of Li-6 is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons.

Wait, or do I need the exact atomic mass? Maybe I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. But since I don't have that, perhaps I can approximate it using the mass of a proton and neutron. A proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(938 + 939.565) MeV/c². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass of each proton and neutron: protons are about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons are about 939.565 MeV/c². So, 3 protons: 3 * 938.2
