Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system with a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says a charge q is placed at a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, potential energy between charges. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring the charges together from infinity. But since it's a charge near a conducting sphere, I need to think about how the sphere responds.

The sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth, so electrons can flow in or out. Conducting spheres have charges reside on their surfaces. So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge would cause the sphere to either gain or lose electrons. Let me think, the charge q outside the sphere would induce an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and a same charge on the far side, but since it's grounded, the sphere can adjust its charge to maintain neutrality unless it's isolated. Wait, no, in this case, is the sphere initially neutral? The problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere, but doesn't mention if it's initially charged. Hmm, probably it's neutral initially, right?

So, when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charges would be: the near side would have -q induced charge if it's a positive charge, or +q if it's negative. But wait, the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges would redistribute. But because it's grounded, any excess charge can leave the sphere. Wait wait, no, wait. If the sphere is grounded, any induced charge would cause a flow of electrons. For example, if the external charge q is positive, it attracts electrons towards the near side of the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, electrons can move freely. So electrons would accumulate on the near side, making that part negatively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can leave the sphere to the ground, right? Or wait, no, the sphere is conducting and grounded. So any excess charge would leave the sphere. Wait, but in the case of a neutral sphere, when you bring a charge near it,
