Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Hmm, let's see. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. All other reactions remain the same. I need to find the ratio of neutrino fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, so I have to choose which ratio it is.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain has several branches. The main one is pp-I, which produces helium-4. Then, there's pp-II and pp-III. Oh right, pp-III involves reactions that produce beryllium-7, which later captures a helium-4 nucleus to form carbon-12. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but I know that pp-III is a minor branch compared to pp-I.

So, the question says that the pp-III branch stops. That means that any neutrinos produced by reactions in that branch won't be happening anymore. But wait, solar neutrinos are mainly from the pp chain, specifically the pp-I branch. Oh, but neutrinos are mostly from the fusion reactions. Let me think. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp chain, which produces positrons and neutrinos when a proton captures a positron or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, the pp chain's dominant
