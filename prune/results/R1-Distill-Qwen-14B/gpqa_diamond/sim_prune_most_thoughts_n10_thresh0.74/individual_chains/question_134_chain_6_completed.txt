Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And then we have to find the enthalpy change, right? The options are given, but I need to figure it out.

Wait, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually exothermic, so the answer should be negative, which matches the options given.

But first, I need to figure out how much acid and base we're dealing with, and whether one is in excess or if they completely neutralize each other. Because the enthalpy of neutralization depends on the amount that actually reacts.

Let me break it down. Each acid contributes H+ ions, and the base contributes OH- ions. The reaction between H+ and OH- is what gives the enthalpy of neutralization, typically around -57 kJ/mol (or about -13.6 kcal/mol, since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ) per mole of H+ neutralized.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate one H+ per molecule. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. In aqueous solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, but the second one might not. Wait, no, in dilute solutions, both H+ from H2SO4 dissociate. So, H2SO4 can contribute 2 H+ ions per molecule. So when 0.3 M H2SO4 is used, each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
3. Determine the limiting reactant (which will determine how much neutralization occurs).
4. Calculate the heat released based on the amount of H+ or OH- that reacts.
5. Use the enthalpy of neutralization per mole to find the total.

Let me compute each step.

First, moles of HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 mol/L, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Since HCl is monoprotic, that's 0.1 mol H+.

Second, moles of H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3, so 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, the base: Ba(OH)2. 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 mol/L, so moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH- per mole, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

So in this case, OH- is the limiting reactant because there's only 0.2 mol of OH- available to react with 0.28 mol H+. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain unreacted.

So the amount of H+ reacting is 0.2 mol (same as OH-). Therefore, the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ (or OH-). I think the standard value is -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or 13.6 kcal/mol). Wait, because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). Let me double-check: 57 kJ /4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. So, each mole of H+ neutralized releases 13.6 kcal.

So for 0.2 mol H+, the heat released would be 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative. So the enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid or base. For H2SO4, if it's a diprotic acid, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second might not be, but in solution, perhaps both are considered. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy is calculated per mole of H+.

Wait, but I think the question is treating the neutralization as the H+ from all acids and OH- from the base. So whether it's HCl or H2SO4, each H+ contributes to the neutralization. So my earlier approach should be correct.

Wait another point: the enthalpy of neutralization is typically for 1 mole of H+ with 1 mole of OH- producing 1 mole of water. So the calculation should be correct.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's what I got. Option D is in kJ, which is -16 kJ. That's about -3.8 kcal (since 16 kJ is 16 /4.184 ≈ 3.81 kcal). So maybe I should check whether the standard enthalpy is per mole or per reaction.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the standard enthalpy of neutralization. I think it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So 57 kJ/mol.

Wait, but 57 kJ per mole of H+ would be 57,000 J per mole. So 0.2 moles would be 11,400 J, which is 11.4 kJ. Oh, wait, but 57 kJ is per mole. Wait, no, 57 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 mole would be 57 * 0.2 = 11.4 kJ. That would be -11.4 kJ. Which is option B (-11.42 kcal?), wait no, option B is -11.42 kcal? Wait no, option B is -11.42 kcal? Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, my initial calculation using kcal: 0.2 *13.6=2.72, so -2.72 kcal (option A). But when using kJ, it's 57 *0.2=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16 kJ, which is about 3.8 kcal (since 16 *4.184=66.944 kJ, which is 16 kJ is 16,000 J, which is about 3.816 kcal). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up kJ and kcal. Let me clarify. 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (57 /4.184 ≈13.6). So if the neutralization is 57 kJ per mole of H+, then 0.2 moles would be 57 *0.2=11.4 kJ, which is approximately 2.72 kcal (11.4 kJ * (1 kcal/4.184 kJ) )= 2.72 kcal.

Wait, no: 11.4 kJ divided by 4.184 kJ/kcal is approximately 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

Alternatively, if the calculation were done in kJ, it would be -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that.

Wait, so perhaps I need to recheck the moles.

Wait, let me double-check the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L =0.1 mol → Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- → 0.2 mol OH^-.

So OH- is 0.2 mol. So the neutralization involves 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O.

So 0.2 mol of H+ neutralized.

At 57 kJ per mole: 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ (exothermic).

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ, but they have option D as -16.0 kJ, and option B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait. No, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so if I calculate 0.2 moles ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is considered differently. Oh wait, perhaps for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy is about -57 kJ per mole of acid. No, that's not right. Because, for HCl, which is monoprotic, each mole contributes one H+. For H2SO4, each mole contributes two H+.

Wait, but when you have a diprotic acid like H2SO4, the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second may not be, especially in dilute solutions. But in this problem, since it's a neutralization reaction, both H+ ions from H2SO4 are considered available for reaction. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+.

So back to the calculation: the reaction is 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-. The OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 H+ reacts with 0.2 OH- to make 0.2 H2O. So 0.2 mole of H+ neutralized.

So then, the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (ΔH per mole of H+). If ΔH is -57 kJ/mol, then it's 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ, which is approximately option D (-16.0 kJ? No, that's -16.0 kJ isn't 11.4). So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the standard enthalpy value. Wait, maybe the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -13.6 kcal/mol (since 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal). So 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal. So that would give -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But then, why is option D -16.0 kJ? Because that would be about 3.82 kcal. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization isn't just the H+ and OH- combining. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the stoichiometry of the reaction between the specific acids and the base, considering their molarities and the neutralization reactions as they would proceed with each other.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we should write the balanced equations for each reaction.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → ?

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → ?

Wait, but in the mixture, all the H+ ions and OH- ions are in the same solution, so they'll just combine, regardless of their source. So the source (whether from HCl or H2SO4) doesn't matter; the total H+ and OH- will neutralize to form water.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, so all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but the options have both kcal and kJ. So perhaps the answer is either in kcal or kJ. Let me recheck the calculation.

If the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -57 kJ, then 0.2 mol → -11.4 kJ. Which is not an option except B, which is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, option B is -11.42 kcal, but that's about 48.5 kJ (11.42 ×4.184≈48.05 kJ). Which is higher than 11.4 kJ.

Wait, maybe I got the wrong standard enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think: I thought it's about -57 kJ per mole H+ or about -13.6 kcal per mole H+.

Wait, maybe the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of acid, but that would be for a monoprotic acid. So for HCl (monoprotic), each mole contributes 57 kJ. For H2SO4 (diprotic), each mole contributes 114 kJ (since two H+). But wait, that's not correct because the second H+ doesn't fully ionize. Wait, but in the context of neutralization, perhaps each H+ contributes to the neutralization, so two H+ per H2SO4.

Wait, but in this problem, we have three solutions being mixed, so all the H+ and OH- are available to react, regardless of their source.

So maybe the correct approach is: total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So 0.2 H+ reacts, so 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

So the heat released is 0.2 × (ΔH per H+).

If ΔH is -57 kJ/mol H+, then 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles?

Let me recalculate:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.5 *0.2=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M → 0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is not 57 kJ but higher. Let me think again. Maybe I should use a more precise value. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57.1 kJ/mol H+ (at 25°C). So 0.2 mol × (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ. Oh, wait, that would be approximately -11.42 kJ.

But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.2 kJ (-11.42 ×4.184 ≈-48.1 kJ). So that's not matching.

Wait, but if the calculation is done in kJ, then it's -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total neutralization of all possible H+ and OH-.

Wait, no. Because OH- is 0.2 mol and H+ is 0.28 mol. So only 0.2 H+ will be neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization releases heat based on the total moles of H+ and OH- that react, which is 0.2 mol. So the total enthalpy change is -57 *0.2= -11.4 kJ. So the answer in kJ is -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Oh wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recheck:

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L *0.2 =0.1 mol → correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L *0.3 =0.09 mol → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L *0.5 =0.1 mol → correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction in a different way. For example, if Ba(OH)2 is a diprotic base, then each mole gives two OH- ions, so each mole can neutralize two H+ ions.

Wait, but that's already accounted for in the calculation. 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH- → which can neutralize 0.2 mol H+.

So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal which is about -48.5 kJ, but my calculation gives -11.4 kJ. So that's not matching any of the options except perhaps if the value is in kJ.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → approximately -11.5 kJ (since 2.72 *4.184≈11.4 kJ).

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than that. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid-base reaction, but considering the stoichiometry of each acid and base.

For example, HCl is a 1:1 acid, H2SO4 is a 2:1 acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a 2:1 base.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization is considered for each acid and base separately, but I think that's not the case because all ions are in solution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is 57 kJ per mole.

Wait, but when 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, 0.2 moles of H2O are formed. So 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ. So same as before.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ as an option except option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Did I mix up the way the reaction is written? Because sometimes enthalpy is given per mole of acid used, but that's not the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the problem and see if I missed any steps.

Wait, another thought: the concentrations are given in mL. Oh wait, I converted them to liters correctly.

HCl: 500 mL → 0.5 L → correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL → 0.3 L → correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL → 0.2 L → correct.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy change per liter of solution. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total enthalpy change in the mixture, but the units are in different terms. So, the options have both kcal and kJ, which complicates things.

Wait, let's compute the result in both units and see.

If 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, and the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole:

0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

If it's -13.6 kcal per mole:

0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal.

So the answer could be either option A (-2.72 kcal) or in kJ, but the options don't have -11.4 kJ. So perhaps the answer is option A.

But why is option B -11.42 kcal? That's approximately -48.5 kJ, which would be for 0.84 moles (48.5 /57 ≈0.85 mol). But we have only 0.2 moles reacting. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So each mole contributes two H+.

But when mixed with a base, the neutralization is as follows:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So regardless of the source, each H+ neutralizes one OH-.

So the calculation is correct as before.

So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But the option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.82 kcal. Wait, 16 kJ is about 3.82 kcal (since 16 /4.184 ≈3.82). So that would be if 0.1 mol of H+ were neutralized (since 0.1 *57=5.7 kJ, but 0.1 *13.6=1.36 kcal) which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is that the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, releasing 0.2 ×13.6=2.72 kcal. So the answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:** A monoprotic acid. Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:** A diprotic acid. Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \), and each mole contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:** \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit. Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{mol/L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \), and each mole contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \). Since 0.28 mol H⁺ reacts with 0.2 mol OH⁻, OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, and only 0.2 mol of H⁺ will be neutralized.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.
   - Using \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \):  
     \( \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Verify against the options:**
   - Option A is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which matches the calculated value.
   - Other options do not align with the calculation. For example, option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) corresponds to approximately \( 3.82 \, \text{kcal} \), which is inconsistent with the reaction.

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization for the given reaction is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

Answer: A
