Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and other factors like albedo. Oh wait, the question says all planets have the same albedo, so that part is taken care of.

The planets are in orbital resonance and their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. Since they're in resonance, their orbital periods are in the given ratios. But wait, how does the orbital period relate to the distance from the star?

Oh right, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So the formula is P² ∝ a³. But since all these planets are around the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for all, so we can compare their periods to find the distance ratios.

Let me assign variables. Let Planet_1's period be P. So:

Planet_1: P
Planet_2: 2P
Planet_3: 2.5P
Planet_4: 3.5P
Planet_5: 5P

Wait, but Kepler's law is P² proportional to a³. So, the ratio of the distances a is the cube root of the ratio of their periods squared.

So for any planet n, a_n is proportional to (P_n)^{2/3}.

So for Planet_2, a2 = (2P)^(2/3). Planet_4, a4 = (3.5P)^(2/3).

But wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ a²) ) )^½, but I think a simpler way is considering that T is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because, T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4), but if the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, then T ∝ a^(-1/2).

Wait, let's get the exact relation right. Equilibrium temperature equation is:

T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^½ * (1 / sqrt
