Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, meaning the gene's function is likely disrupted. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations. The sequencing shows changes in the first exon area of all mutants. So I'm looking at the first exon sequences of each mutant and comparing them to the intact gene.

The intact gene's sequence is given as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the exons are exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but the question is about the first exon, so the first part of the sequence.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact: The third nucleotide. Wait, let me count. The intact starts with ATGTTTCTC... So the first few nucleotides are ATG TTT CTC GCT... Hmm, wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are.

Wait, the question is about the first exon. So the first exon is part of the mRNA, so any mutation here might affect the protein product.

Let me look for where the mutations are. Let's see each mutant's change.

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGC... The intact is ATGTTTCTCGC... So at some point, the wild type has TTT and CTC, and the mutant has TCT and ACG? Wait, perhaps wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation. If a mutation introduces a premature stop codon, it could disrupt the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact gene: starts with ATG (start codon) followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG...

Mutant 1:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATG...

So let's compare each base:

Position 4: Intact is T, mutant has T? Wait, let me line them up.

Intact: positions 1-10: 1:A, 2:T,3:G,4:T,5:T,6:C,7:T,8:C,9:G,10:C...

Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps the first difference is at position 6 or so.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note the exact changes.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C... Wait, maybe I should look for where the change is.

Wait, let me go step by step.

In the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT
