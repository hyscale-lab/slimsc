Okay, so I have this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving, and the light is going through it. Normally, when we talk about the speed of light in a medium, it's v = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But here, the medium (glass) is moving, so does that affect the observed speed?

I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities add up in a certain way when you change frames. Like, if an object is moving at speed u in a frame moving at speed v, then in the lab frame, it's u + v, right? But wait, that's for objects, not light. Because light's speed is always c in any inertial frame according to Einstein's postulate. Or wait, is that only in vacuum?

Wait no, the speed of light in a medium isn't c. So maybe this problem is considering the medium's motion affecting the observed speed. Hmm.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass's velocity is v, and the light's velocity in the glass is c_glass = c/n, but relative to the glass.

Wait, but when the glass is
