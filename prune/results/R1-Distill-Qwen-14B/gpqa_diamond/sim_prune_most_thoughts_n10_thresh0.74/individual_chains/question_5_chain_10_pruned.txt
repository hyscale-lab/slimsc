Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the operator is P, which is a vector operator. It's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, spin operators have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-½ particles like a muon.

The components of P are given. P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0), which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled. And P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, which is diagonal with 1 and -1 on the diagonal.

Wait, no, actually, the Pauli matrices are usually scaled without the ħ/2 factor. So P must be the spin operator S scaled by something. Oh, but the problem says it's operator P, which is in terms of the components. So each component is (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix.

So the operator P is given in terms of its components. Now, because the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), since it's in x-z plane. Wait no— in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe we can express the operator along n as a combination of x and z components.

Wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product: P·n. So P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator becomes P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

But wait, in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

But since P_x and P_z are known matrices, I can write this operator as (ħ/2) [ σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ ], where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So I'm looking for eigenvectors where this operator multiplied by the state equals (ħ/2) times the state.

Now, the eigenvalues of the operator P·n should be ±ħ/2, since for spin-½ systems, the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2) times the magnitude of the operator (which here is 1, since it's normalized by the factors of ħ/2).

So the eigenvalue for the up state is +ħ/2. That makes sense because the problem states we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The operator inside the brackets is σ · n', where n' is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but scaled by ħ/2. Wait, no, the operator is (σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ), and it's multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of the matrix (σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). The eigenvalues of that matrix, being a 2x2 Hermitian matrix, would be ±1, so the eigenvalues of P·n are ±ħ/2, which aligns.

So to find the eigenvectors, I can look at the matrix (σ_x sin
