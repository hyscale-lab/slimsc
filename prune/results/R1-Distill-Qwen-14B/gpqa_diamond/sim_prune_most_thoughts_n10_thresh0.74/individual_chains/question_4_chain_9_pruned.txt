Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. I think that's because of some of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations, right. There are four of them. Let me try to remember each one. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which in our world says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. Oh yeah, because there are no isolated magnetic poles, so the net magnetic flux through any closed surface must be zero. So the equation is ∇·B = 0.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of induction, which deals with the curl of the electric field. It says that a changing magnetic field produces a circulating electric field. The last one is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which involves the curl of the magnetic field and the current plus displacement current.

So, the question says in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles. That must mean that the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, would change. Because in our world, ∇·B = 0, but if you can have isolated poles, like magnetic monopoles, then maybe the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to some magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's Law for electricity includes electric charge.

Wait, but the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. So the second equation (Gauss for B) would change, but what about the others? The other equations involve the curl of E and B for Faraday and Ampère's laws. Faraday’s Law in our world is about the curl of E being -dB/dt, and Ampère's Law is about the curl of B being μ₀(J + ε₀ dE/dt). Those equations relate to the fields' curls and their time derivatives.

If magnetic monopoles exist, how does that affect the other equations? Well, I think Faraday's Law would still hold because it's about how changing B fields create E fields. But wait, I'm not sure. If there's a magnetic current, maybe Ampère's Law would change. Oh wait, Ampère's Law in our universe includes the displacement current because Maxwell added it
