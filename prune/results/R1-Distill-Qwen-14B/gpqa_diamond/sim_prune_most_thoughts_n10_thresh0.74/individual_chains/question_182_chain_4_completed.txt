Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I remember that equation is related to the dark current in semiconductors. Dark current is the current that flows even when there's no light, right? And it's especially important in devices like LEDs and photodiodes.

The question asks about the validity conditions of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think this equation applies in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. So, what does that regime imply?

From what I recall, in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge itself. That means the electric field created by the accumulated charge is so strong that it starts to limit the current flow. This happens when the injection of carriers is so high that the space charge regions build up.

Now, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each.

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, causing more scattering and maybe changing the current behavior. Single-carrier means only electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the potential barriers for carriers are negligible. But what about drift current? If drift current is negligible, then maybe the current is dominated by something else. But I thought in Mott-Gurney, drift is important. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, not too sure yet.

Option B: trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean it's in the regime where the work function is matched, so carriers can move without much barrier. So Ohmic contact probably means that. And negligible diffusion current—so in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, that makes sense. Because in SCLC, the space charge creates an electric field causing drift. So maybe this is correct.

Option C: single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contact has a potential barrier, so that might mean it's not Ohmic. If it's a Schottky contact, there's a barrier, which affects carrier injection. So would that affect the validity? The Mott-Gurney equation assumes certain conditions about the injection. I think the derivation probably assumes that the device is in a regime where the potential barriers are negligible or that the contact is Ohmic. So if it's a Schottky contact, maybe the equation doesn't apply because the injection is limited. Or maybe not, because I'm not certain.

Option D: two-carrier device with Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. Two-carrier would be like both electrons and holes. But the Mott-Gurney equation is for a single-carrier situation, I believe. Because in two-carrier, you'd have more complexities like generation-recombination processes, which aren't part of the SCLC in a single-carrier model. So D is probably incorrect.

So narrowing down, it's between A, B, C. Let me think again. The derivation of Mott-Gurney equation, from what I remember, assumes that the current is limited by the space charge, which in turn comes from the movement of carriers under the electric field. It also assumes that the carriers can be treated as a single type (single-carrier), and that the injection is so efficient that the device is in the SCLC regime.

Ohmic contact implies that the work function is matched so that there's no potential barrier for carriers. So when the Mott-Gurney equation is derived, it's under the assumption that the contact is Ohmic. Because if there's a barrier, like in a Schottky contact, the current injection would be limited, which would mean the device isn't in the space-charge-limited region. Instead, it might be in the thermionic (or Fowler-Nordheim) regime.

So option B says no carrier injection barrier. Ohmic contact is the same as no injection barrier, right? Because Ohmic contact implies that there's no barrier for carrier movement across the contact. So if the device has an Ohmic contact, that means the injection isn't a limiting factor. So the current is limited by the space charge, not the contact. That aligns with the SCLC scenario.

Now, option B also mentions negligible diffusion current. In the Mott-Gurney equation, the current is due to drift under the electric field from the space charge. If the diffusion were significant, the current might be dominated by that instead. So the equation assumes that diffusion is negligible, making drift the main contributor. So yes, negligible diffusion current is a correct condition.

Option A says negligible drift current. That can't be right because the equation is based on drift current. If drift were negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So A is wrong.

So looking back, option B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion. That seems to fit. So the correct answer would be B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This regime assumes that the current is limited by the electric field created by the accumulated space charge, rather than other factors like carrier injection or diffusion. The equation is derived under specific conditions, and its validity depends on these being met.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This states the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation is based on drift current being the dominant mechanism, so the condition of negligible drift current is incorrect. Thus, this option is invalid.

- **Option B**: This states the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions of the SCLC regime, where the current is dominated by drift under the space charge electric field, and diffusion is negligible. This option is consistent with the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold.

- **Option C**: This states the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a potential barrier, which would limit carrier injection and place the device in a different regime (e.g., thermionic or Fowler-Nordheim). Therefore, this option is invalid.

- **Option D**: This states the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, as the presence of two carriers introduces complexities like generation-recombination processes, which are not part of the SCLC model. Thus, this option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
