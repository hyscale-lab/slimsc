Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data.

First, the problem says the FTIR shows ester group absorption. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's a key functional group here. So the molecule must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let me note them down. 

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern could be either ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the aromatic signals are two, which suggests maybe two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in the para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs. But wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so if it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Alternatively, maybe there's another group causing different splitting.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically part of a double bond, like in an alkene. A doublet suggests each proton is next to one other proton. Maybe a trans configuration? Or perhaps part of a substituent like a vinyl group attached to the ring.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two methyl groups. Since there are two signals, they might be in different environments. Or maybe they're identical but split into different signals for some reason. Wait, but two signals would imply two sets of methyl groups.

No signals for –CH2 groups, so the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups. So any substituents on the ring probably don't have CH2. For example, an ester group would be something like OCOOR, where R might be a methyl group or another alkyl. Hmm.

So let's think about what substituents are present. The molecule has an ester group, which is O-C-O. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OCOOR) and another substituent is something else.

Wait, but it's a di-substituted benzene. So two substituents on the ring. Let me imagine possible structures.

A common di-substitution with an ester could be something like a benzyl ester. Alternatively, maybe a vinyl ester group attached to the ring.

Wait, the vinyl protons in the NMR: doublet and doublet of quartets. Let me think. A vinyl group (CH2CH2) would have two protons. But when split, each proton can split the other. For example, in a vinyl group (trans or cis), each proton is next to one other, so you get a doublet. But the problem says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe one of the protons is adjacent to another group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another scenario: perhaps the vinyl group is part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let's think about an ester group like OCOOR, where R is a vinyl group. Wait, but R would be attached to the
