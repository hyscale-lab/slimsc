Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm going to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question involves some reactions and mixtures, and I need to figure out the number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X. Let me try to break down the information given.

So, there's a mixture X which is equimolar of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of alkenes or something that can react with bromine, like unsaturated compounds. Alkenes (double bonds) or maybe even some aromatic compounds could do that, but since it's a mixture, perhaps each component has double bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction, and forms another mixture Y of two liquids. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, what kind of reaction is this? Since Pt is a catalyst, maybe hydrogenation is happening. Oh wait, but waitâ€”the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh right, so that's different from just adding hydrogen. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, for example, something like ozone splitting into O2 and O3? Not sure, maybe in another context like the decomposition of H2O2?

Wait, but the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components must not have double bonds anymore. Because if they had, bromine would decolorize. So mixture X had unsaturated compounds, and after reaction, they become saturated. So maybe X is a mixture of alkenes, and Y is their hydrogenated forms (alkanes) plus maybe some other products from the disproportionation.

Wait, but the reaction is a disproportionation, that suggests that one of the reactants is being both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps the initial mixture X has a compound that can undergo such a reaction. Oh, maybe it's something like cyclohexene and something else. Wait, no, cyclohexene would just hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But what if it's a diene or something more complex?

Wait, let's think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions to give the same substance Z. And Z is a hydro
