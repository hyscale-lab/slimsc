Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start breaking it down.

The question is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions and changes into mixture Y. Then, both X and Y are hydrogenated to form a substance Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Plus, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Hmm.

First, let's try to understand the transformations. Mixture X is equimolar and decolorizes bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine (Br2) water usually happens when there are double bonds. So, the liquids in X must have some unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or maybe alkynes, because they can add bromine.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. Y is also equimolar but doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, Y's components don't have double bonds anymore. The reaction with Pt suggests a possible hydrogenation, but wait, the question says it's a disproportionation. Oh right, because after treatment, it's a different mixture, Y.

Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is being disproportionated. For example, something like benzene rings undergoing hydrogenation would lose their double bonds, but that's more addition. Wait, but the problem says X's mixture decolorizes Br2, so they have double bonds, and Y doesn't, so Y has single bonds where the double bonds were.

Wait, but the reaction is with Pt and heat, which sounds like catalytic hydrogenation. Oh, but wait, the result is a disproportionation, which isn't a typical hydrogenation. Hmm, maybe the reaction in X isn't hydrogenation but something else. Wait, or perhaps mixture X is a mixture of alkenes or something that can undergo different types of reactions.

Wait, but the problem says that after treatment with Pt and heat, Y is formed through disproportionation. So maybe X has a compound that can disproportionate into two different compounds. For example, maybe something like cyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: substance Z is formed by hydrogenating both X and Y. So when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and Y when hydrogenated also gives Z. So Z must be a saturated compound, like an alkane. Because hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds, making them single bonds. So Z is an alkane.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate Z's molecular formula. Let's denote Z as CnH2n+2. The mass fraction of H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) * 100 =14.28%.

Let me compute that. Let's set up the equation:

( (2n + 2) ) / (12n + 2) ) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n + 2 = 0.1428*(12n +2)

Compute 0.1428 *12n = 1.7136 n, 0.1428*2=0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 1.7136n + 0.2856

Subtract 1.7136n from both sides:

0.2864n + 2 = 0.2856

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, perhaps 14.28% is approximately 1/7? Because 1/7 is about 14.2857%. So 14.28% is roughly 1/7.

So, (2n+2)/(12n+2) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2n+2) = 1*(12n +2)

14n +14 = 12n +2

14n -12n = 2 -14

2n = -12?

Wait, that gives n = -6, which can't be right. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's recalculate.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100% =14.28%.

Hydrogen's molar mass is approx 1 g/mol. So for Z, which is CnH2n+2, the molar mass is 12n + (2n+2) =14n +2.

The mass of H is (2n+2)*1 g/mol = 2n+2 g/mol.

So, (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by (14n+2):

2n +2 = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Compute 0.1428 *14n = 2n (because 0.1428 *14 ≈2), and 0.1428 *2≈0.2856.

So,

2n +2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps my assumption about Z being CnH2n+2 is incorrect. Maybe Z is something else, like maybe it's a cyclic compound or a different structure.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the exact value.

Given 14.28% is 1/7, so:

(2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by 7*(14n + 2):

7*(2n +2) =14n +2.

14n +14 =14n +2.

Subtract 14n: 14=2. That's impossible. So maybe my initial assumption about Z's structure is wrong.

Alternative idea: perhaps Z is cyclopropane or another cyclic structure, but wait, that might not help.

Wait, perhaps Z isn't a simple alkane. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe Z is not an alkane. But hydrogenation usually would give alkanes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let's think again: when you hydrogenate something, you add H2 across double bonds. So if X has a molecule with a double bond, hydrogenation makes it single. But in this case, X and Y both hydrogenate to Z, so Z must be a single product.

Wait, the problem says that when X is hydrogenated, you get Z. Similarly, Y is hydrogenated to give Z as well. So X and Y must be different dihydrogenation products that converge to Z.

Wait, but wait. If X and Y are each a mixture of two liquids, and each, when hydrogenated, give just Z. So each component in X and Y must hydrogenate to the same Z.

So for example, perhaps X has a diene and another compound, but upon hydrogenation, both give the same Z.

Wait, but the problem says that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So each of the two liquids must have a double bond. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it's subjected to a reaction which is a disproportionation, leading to Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids that do not decolorize Br2. So Y's components must be saturated, no double bonds.

Wait, but Y's mixture, when hydrogenated, gives Z. Which would mean Y's components are perhaps something else, but each hydrogenates to Z.

Wait, but if Y's components are saturated, like alkanes, then hydrogenation wouldn't change them. So maybe Y's components are something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try another angle. Since Z's hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, that's 1/7. So let's compute Z
