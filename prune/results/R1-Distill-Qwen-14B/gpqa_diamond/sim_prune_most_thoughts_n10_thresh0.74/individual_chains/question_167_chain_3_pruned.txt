Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to unpack it.

The state given is a Schrödinger cat state, right? The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The task is to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent or squeezed states. The cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's definitely non-Gaussian.

For the relative entropy, I remember that it's a measure of how different rho is from tau. So the del_b would be the difference in the von Neumann entropies of the two states. But wait, no. Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho). So the formula given is (Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)). But wait, that would be (S(rho) - S(tau)) with a negative sign in the entropy formula. Wait, let me see. No, the von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho), so the relative entropy measure here is S(rho) - S(tau) without the negative? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this question, the formula is only Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau). So perhaps they're using del_b as this difference, but I'm not sure if that's the standard measure.

Wait, the question says the measure is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's S(rho) - S(tau), since S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). Wait, no, wait: S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho), so Tr(rho ln rho) is
