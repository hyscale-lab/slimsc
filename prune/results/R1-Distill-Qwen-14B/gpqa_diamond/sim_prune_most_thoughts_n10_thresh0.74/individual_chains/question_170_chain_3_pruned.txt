Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question again carefully. 

The problem says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Wait, wait. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Hmm. I think this is a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector with two elements. Let me recall that in quantum mechanics, the spin state of an electron can be represented as a two-component vector in the Pauli spinor notation. So, the state vector here is (3i, 4), which would correspond to [3i; 4] in matrix form.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ħ/2 ψ. Oh wait, because the Pauli matrices represent the spin components scaled by ħ/2, right? So S is (ħ/2)σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix.

Wait, no. Let me think. The spin operator S is given by S = (ħ/2) σ. So the expectation value is <S_y> = (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So the expectation value of σ_y would be ψ† σ_y ψ, and then we multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value of S_y.

Right. So first, I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ, then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down the components. The state vector ψ is [3i; 4]. So ψ†, the conjugate transpose, would be [ -3 (because the first component is 3i, its conjugate is -3i?), wait, wait, no. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i. So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The spinor is given as (3i, 4). So it's a column vector where the first element is 3i and the second is 4. So in matrix terms, ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4].
