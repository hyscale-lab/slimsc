Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given a specific state. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the basis is |+z>, |0z>, and |-z> or something like that. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Wait, the question is about the uncertainty ΔP_z. Oh right, the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

But to do that, I need to calculate ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z^2 |ψ⟩. Let me write down the given state vector. The state ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. 

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's ψ† P_z ψ. Given P_z's matrix:

P_z matrix:
[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So, when I multiply P_z with ψ, I get a new vector. Let's compute that. Let me denote ψ as [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Multiplying P_z with ψ:
P_z ψ = [ ħ*a, 0*b + 0*c, -ħ*c ]^T = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. But wait, the given state has real numbers, so ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)
= (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4)
= 0. Oh, interesting, the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Wait, that's because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So P_z's expectation could be zero here.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. To do that, I can compute P_z squared acting on ψ, then take the inner product with ψ. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, maybe it's easier.

Wait, let's compute P_z squared first. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So P_z² matrix is:
[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, (ħ)^2 ] ]

Wait no, the diagonal elements are (ħ)^2 and (-ħ)^2, which are both ħ². So P_z squared matrix is:
[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So when I compute P_z² ψ, each component is multiplied by their respective eigenvalues squared.

P_z² ψ = [ ħ² * a, 0 * b, ħ² * c ]^T
= [ ħ² (-1/2), 0, ħ² (-1/2) ]^T
= [ -ħ²/2, 0,
