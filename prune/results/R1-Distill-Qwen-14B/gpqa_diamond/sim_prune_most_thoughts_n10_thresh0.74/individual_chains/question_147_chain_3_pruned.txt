Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm. Let me read it again. Alright, the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various c fractions.

Wait, annihilation reactions often involve converting matter and antimatter into other particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can treat this as a low-energy process. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll have to think through the steps carefully.

First, I should probably consider conservation laws. In any reaction, momentum and energy are conserved. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving, but the proton is at rest? Or are they both moving? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. So the initial momentum would mainly come from the antiproton.

But wait, in annihilation processes, the initial particles (proton and antiproton) have rest mass. The proton has rest mass about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton same. So together they have a rest mass of around 1876 MeV. But the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Each A has mass 300 MeV, so four times 300 is 1200 MeV. So wait, that's less than the initial rest mass. Wait, that can't be right. Because rest mass energy must be conserved, unless they're moving. Hmm, wait, but in a typical annihilation, the rest masses are converted into other particles, but perhaps energy isn't conserved because kinetic energy is involved.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of center of mass energy. The initial system's center of mass energy is important. Because the antiproton is moving, the total energy is more than just the sum of their rest masses. But wait, since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center of mass frame might be moving relative to the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is happening in such a way that the products (the A particles) are moving in the same direction as the initial particles. But I'm getting a bit confused.
