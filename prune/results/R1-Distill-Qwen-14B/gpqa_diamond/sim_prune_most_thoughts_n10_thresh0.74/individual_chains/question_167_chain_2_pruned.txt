Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about non-Gaussianity. Hmm, the question gives me a Schrödinger cat state and asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using relative entropy. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because Gaussian states are easier to handle, but non-Gaussian states are necessary for certain quantum computing tasks and such. The non-Gaussianity here is being measured by the relative entropy between the given state and a reference Gaussian state.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/ N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, the relative entropy measure is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of the Gaussian reference.

I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the best-fitting Gaussian state. But wait, in this case, the measure given is already the difference between the two entropies.

But wait, wait. The relative entropy is a measure of how different rho is from tau. So, if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. Otherwise, it's positive. So for a Gaussian state, this measure would be zero.

But the problem here is about a Schrödinger cat state. I remember that cat states are superpositions of coherent states, which are Gaussian. But when you have a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian. So the given state |psi> is a non-Gaussian state.

But wait, the options include D) 0. Could that be the case? Let me think again. The relative entropy measure del_b is the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian's entropy. If the state is Gaussian, del_b is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The state |psi> is a sum of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but when you take a superposition, the resulting state may not be Gaussian. So, the state here is non-Gaussian, so the nG should be positive, so option D (0
