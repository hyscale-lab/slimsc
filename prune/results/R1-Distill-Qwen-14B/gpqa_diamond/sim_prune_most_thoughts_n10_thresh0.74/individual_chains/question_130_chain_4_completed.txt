Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space. These clouds absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The goal is to find the lowest redshift where these objects can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question is about absorption. So when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs the light at Lyman alpha wavelength, creating a absorption line. But since the cloud is moving away from us, or if it's at some redshift, that wavelength would be stretched due to the expansion of the universe.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet because Earth's atmosphere blocks those wavelengths. So how does that affect the detection? Well, if the absorption line is redshifted into the optical range, then it becomes observable from the ground.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the far-ultraviolet, so not visible from the ground. But if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the 1216 Angstroms line would shift into the optical range. Let's see, the optical range is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) up to maybe 700 nm (red). So we want the redshifted wavelength to be within that range.

Redshift (z) is calculated using the formula: observed wavelength (λ) = rest wavelength (λ0) * (1 + z). So we need λ to be in the optical range, say greater than or equal to 400 nm. Let me plug in the numbers.

The rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. So:

λ = 121.6 nm * (1 + z)

We want λ >= 400 nm. So:

121.6 * (1 + z) >= 400

Divide both sides by 121.6:

1 + z >= 400 / 121.6

Let me calculate 400 / 121.6. Let's see, 121.6 times 3 is 364.8, which is less than 400. 121.6 * 3.29 would be closer. Wait, let's do the division properly.

400 divided by 121.6. Let me compute it step by step.

400 / 120 is approximately 3.333. 121.6 is a bit more than 120, so the result will be a bit less than 3.333.

Calculating 121.6 * 3.29:

121.6 * 3 = 364.8

121.6 * 0.29 = approx 35.264 (since 121.6 *0.3 is 36.48, minus 121.6 *0.01=1.216 → 36.48-1.216=35.264)

364.8 +35.264 = 399.064. That's very close to 400.

So 121.6 * 3.29 ≈ 399.064, just a bit under 400. So 1+z needs to be at least about 3.3 or so. So z≈3.3 -1 =2.3.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 400 /121.6 exactly.

400 ÷ 121.6 = ?

Let me compute it as 40000 / 1216 → since 400 is 400.0, 400.0 *10=4000, 4000*10=40000, and 121.6 *100=12160, so 40000 /12160 is the same as 400/121.6.

40000 ÷ 12160 = let's see. 12160 × 3 is 36480. 40000-36480=3520. Now, 12160 × 0.29 is approx 3520. Let me confirm:

12160 × 0.2 = 2432.

12160 × 0.09 = 1094.4.

2432 + 1094.4 = 3526.4, which is just a bit above 3520. So 0.29 would give 3526.4, which is a little more than 3520. So the exact value is a little less than 3.29.

So 400/121.6 ≈ 3.29, perhaps around 3.295. So 1 + z ≈ 3.295 → z ≈ 2.295.

So the redshift needs to be at least about 2.295 for the Lyman alpha absorption line to be at 400 nm. Ground-based optical telescopes can't see below that because the wavelength would be in the UV, which is blocked.

Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So any object with a redshift higher than this value would have the Lyman alpha line redshifted into the optical. So the lower limit is the smallest z where λ >= 400 nm. So z_min is approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options:

A) 3 → 3.0

B)1.2 →1.2

C)2.4 →2.4

D)1.9 →1.9

So our calculation is about 2.295, so the lower limit is z ≈2.3. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So the lower limit is just above 2.3. So the minimum redshift would be higher than 2.3, so the lowest z that allows detection is z=2.4? Or is it that any z above 2.3 can be detected, so the lower limit is 2.3, but the options are given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about when the Lyman alpha is just at the optical limit. So the minimal z is when λ = 400 nm. So z = (400/121.6) -1 = (3.295) -1=2.295. So about 2.3.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is C)2.4. But wait, the options don't have 2.3. Alternatively, perhaps the lower limit is the minimal z where the Lyman alpha is just in the optical. So the minimal z is 2.3, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer is 2.4 as the lower limit, because anything above that would be detectable.

Wait, but the problem says 'lower limit on the redshift' such that the object can be detected. So the minimal z is about 2.3, meaning the lower limit is 2.3. So the minimal redshift is 2.3.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4. Hmm, but why would you pick 2.4 as a lower limit? Because if the minimal is 2.3, you can actually have z=2.3 and higher. So the lower limit is 2.3, but the options don't have that. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, the optical telescopes can only observe wavelengths that are not blocked by the atmosphere. So the Lyman-alpha line needs to be redshifted beyond the atmospheric cutoff, which is about 300 nm. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm. So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A (121.6 nm) is way below that. So to observe it from the ground, it needs to be redshifted into the optical range, which starts around 400 nm.

Wait, but what's the exact cutoff? I think the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm, but there are windows in the near-UV. For example, some ground-based telescopes can observe in the near-UV, but not all. If the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the visible, say above 400 nm, then it's in the optical.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the range of optical telescopes. Let me think. The optical range is roughly 400 nm to 700 nm. So the Lyman alpha absorption line is at 1216 A, which is 121.6 nm. To be observed in optical, it must be redshifted so that 121.6*(1+z) >= 400 nm.

So as I computed, z >= (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.295. So z must be at least about 2.3.

Looking at the options, the only option higher than 2.3 is C)2.4 and A)3. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z is 2.3. But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps this is a trick question.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lyman-alpha line is observed at 121.6 nm, which is in the far-UV. To reach the optical, it has to redshift beyond 400 nm. So z must be such that (121.6)(1+z) >= 400 → z >= (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.295, as I said. So the lower limit is around 2.3.

But the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the only option higher than 2.3 is C)2.4. So the lower limit would be 2.4. Because anything below 2.4 would not redshift the line into the optical.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For z=2.3, the observed wavelength is 121.6*(1+2.3) = 121.6 *3.3 = 401.28 nm. That's in the optical (violet), so that's detectable. So the minimal z is 2.3. So if the options don't have 2.3, which is closer to 2.4, then C)2.4 would be the next higher option. But wait, the question asks for the lower limit such that they can be detected. So lower limit is the minimal z, which is 2.3. But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the redshift is higher because the quasar's light is being observed in the optical, but the Lyman alpha line is in the UV, but from our telescopes, which can't see that. So the quasar itself must be at a high enough redshift that the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical.

Wait, but the question is about the clouds, not the quasars. The quasars are background objects, and the clouds are in the foreground, intervening. So the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which absorbs the Lyman alpha line. Then, from our telescopes, we observe the quasar's spectrum, which shows a dip (absorption line) at the redshifted Lyman alpha.

So for us to see that absorption line, it must be in the optical. So again, the calculation holds: 121.6*(1+z) = λ_obs. We need λ_obs >= 400 nm.

So z >= (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.295. So the minimal z is about 2.3.

So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. Now, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the only option that is higher than 2.3 is C)2.4. So the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait, if the redshift is 2.4, then the observed wavelength would be 121.6 *3.4 = 413.44 nm, which is violet but in optical. So anything above 2.3 would work, but the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the minimal redshift where detection is possible.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.3, so the lower limit is z=2.3. But since 2.3 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4, as the next possible option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the atmosphere doesn't allow observations below 300 nm. So to observe a line at 300 nm, which is UVA, but maybe that's possible? So if the Lyman alpha is at 300 nm, then z would be (300/121.6) -1 ≈ 1.46. So for that, z=1.46. But then for a ground-based telescope, if it can observe up to 300 nm, then that's possible.

Wait, but most ground-based optical telescopes can't observe below 300 nm due to atmospheric absorption. Some specialized telescopes can observe in the near-UV, maybe down to like 320 nm. So perhaps the Lyman alpha line needs to be redshifted beyond 300 nm to be visible from the ground.

Wait, that changes things. Let me recalculate.

If the redshifted Lyman alpha line is at 300 nm, then:

λ_obs = 300 nm = 121.6 nm * (1 + z)

(1 + z) = 300/121.6 ≈ 2.468.

z ≈ 1.468.

So if the line is redshifted to 300 nm, which is in the near-UV and perhaps observable from some ground-based telescopes, then the minimal z is about 1.47.

But looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 1.47 is between B)1.2 and D)1.9. So the minimal z would be about 1.47. So the lower limit would be approximately 1.5.

Looking at the options, D)1.9 is higher than that, but B)1.2 is lower than 1.47. So perhaps the lower limit is 1.47, but since the options don't have that, maybe the correct option is D)1.9. But wait, why would it be 1.9?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift such that the clouds can be detected. The clouds are neutral hydrogen, and their absorption causes a dip in the quasar's spectrum at Lyman alpha.

So the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the Lyman alpha absorption line is redshifted into the optical. Therefore, the minimal redshift is when the Lyman alpha is at the start of the optical window, which is about 400 nm.

So z = (400/121.6) -1 ≈ 2.295.

Looking at the options, the only higher options are C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit would be 2.3, but since the options only have 2.4, then the correct answer must be C)2.4.

Wait, but why is the option D)1.9 present? Let me think if I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula z = (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) -1.

So for observed wavelength λ, z = λ / λ0 -1.

Wait, earlier I used 400/121.6=3.295, so z=2.295. So yes.

But maybe the question is about the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Wait, no, the cloud is the object whose redshift we are considering because the cloud is the one causing the absorption. So the cloud's redshift z is what we're calculating.

So the correct minimal z is approximately 2.3. Since the options don't have that, the next available higher option is C)2.4.

So the answer should be C)2.4.


To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å or 121.6 nm) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the redshifted wavelength falls within the optical range. Optical telescopes observe wavelengths approximately between 400 nm and 700 nm, with the atmosphere blocking wavelengths below ~300 nm. Therefore, the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into the optical range for it to be detectable.

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) and the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must be at least 400 nm to fall within the optical range. Substituting these values:

\[
400 = 121.6 \cdot (1 + z)
\]

\[
1 + z = \frac{400}{121.6} \approx 3.295
\]

\[
z \approx 3.295 - 1 = 2.295
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to be redshifted into the optical range is approximately \( z \approx 2.3 \). However, since the options provided do not include 2.3, the next higher option is \( z = 2.4 \), which corresponds to an observed wavelength slightly beyond 400 nm and within the optical range.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 3**: Too high, as \( z = 3 \) would result in a wavelength much longer than necessary.
- **B) 1.2**: Too low, as \( z = 1.2 \) would place the Lyman alpha line at \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 267.84 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: Slightly higher than the calculated \( z \approx 2.3 \), but the only option that ensures the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical range.
- **D) 1.9**: Too low, as \( z = 1.9 \) would place the Lyman alpha line at \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 121.6 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 308.16 \, \text{nm} \), which is in the UV and not detectable by optical telescopes.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**, as it represents the lower limit on the redshift where the Lyman alpha line can be detected in the optical range.
