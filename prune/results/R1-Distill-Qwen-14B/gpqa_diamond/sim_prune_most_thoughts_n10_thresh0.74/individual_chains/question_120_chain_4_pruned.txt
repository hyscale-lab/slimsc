Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Because I remember that parallax angle (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to the distance of the star. So, a star at distance d (in parsecs) has a parallax plx = 1/d. Oh right, so when plx increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

But wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Oh! Uniform distribution in space, I think. So the number density of stars is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume.

So, let's model this. Let's think in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, a change in plx corresponds to a change in distance. Let me think about how the volume between two distances relates to the parallax.

The volume between two spheres (say, from distance d to d + dd) is the volume of the shell. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume would be 4πr² dr. Here, r is the distance d, so the volume element is 4πd² dd.

But wait, since we're
