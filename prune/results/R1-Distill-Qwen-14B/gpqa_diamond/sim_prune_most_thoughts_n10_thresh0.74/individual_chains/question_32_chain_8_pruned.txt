Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its velocity, and in the relativistic case, we have to consider the gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can compute gamma first.

Let me calculate gamma. So v = 0.96c. Then v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1 gives 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus. The total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is the rest mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. But in particle physics, energies are often expressed in GeV, and masses are in GeV/c². So when we calculate the rest energy, it's mass times c squared, which would be in GeV.

Wait, but the mass of the Li-6 nucleus—I need to find that. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately known. Let me think, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814, and 3 * 939 = 2817. Adding those together gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. But wait, that's for six nucleons. So 5631 MeV is 5.631
