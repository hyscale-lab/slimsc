Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but let's try to break it down. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So the problem says we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture can decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two different liquids. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which probably means it doesn't have any hydrogenatable bonds like double bonds or something else.

Wait, the key points are:

1. Mixture X has two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, they probably have unsaturated bonds, like double bonds or triple bonds. Because bromine water reacts with alkenes and alkynes.

2. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form mixture Y. So, that means the reaction is a disproportionation, which is when one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is two liquids, so perhaps each of them undergoes a change. Or maybe each component in X is undergoing a reaction.

Wait, but the question says that after the reaction, it's mixture Y which is equimolar of two other liquids. So, perhaps each component in X disproportionates into two different products, but since the mixture is equimolar, maybe each component in X is in 1:1 ratio, and each gives two components in Y, but then Y is also equimolar, so perhaps each X component gives one product each in Y that's in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think again. X is two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, they form Y, which is also two liquids, equimolar. So perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene or something that can undergo hydrogenation, but no, wait, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components are more saturated.

Wait, but wait. X can decolorize bromine, so
