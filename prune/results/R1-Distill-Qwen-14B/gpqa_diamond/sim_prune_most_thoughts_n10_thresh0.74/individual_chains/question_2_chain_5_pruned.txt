Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I'm supposed to find out how many carbon atoms are in the final product, product 3.

First, let's think about the starting material. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. I remember its structure is a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. The structure is something like benzaldehyde but with a vinyl group. So the formula for trans-cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. Right, because benzene is C6H5, then the aldehyde part is CHO, but the chain is actually CH2=CH-CHO. Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, no, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. No, wait again. Hmm, maybe I should write it down. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde is attached to a vinyl group. So the structure is benzaldehyde with the aldehyde group attached to a CH2 group, but that's not right. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, actually,
