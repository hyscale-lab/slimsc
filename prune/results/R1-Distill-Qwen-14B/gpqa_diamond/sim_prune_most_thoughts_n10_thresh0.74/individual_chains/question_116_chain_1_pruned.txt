Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

So, the question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR has two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that triplet and quartet patterns usually indicate coupling between neighboring protons. For example, a triplet might mean each proton is next to two others, maybe in a CH2CH3 group. Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me think: a triplet at 0.9 ppm is often from a methyl group attached to something else. Like, CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Because the triplet would be from each CH3 proton coupling with two protons from the adjacent CH2.

So the triplet (6H) suggests two equivalent methyl groups, each with 3H. So maybe it's like two CH3 groups attached to a central CH2. For example, ethyl groups or something. The quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) might be a CH2CH2 group, but wait, quartet implies each proton is next to three others? No, wait, no. Quartet means each proton is next to two others that are split, which would come from a CH2CH2 arrangement. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, no, let me think: a quartet is n+1 where n=3, so each proton is adjacent to three equivalent protons. That would imply a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- kind of structure? No, wait, no, that's more for a triplet. Wait a second, maybe the quartet arises from a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group. Because each proton in the CH2 would split into a quartet. Because the neighboring group has two protons, so n=2, so it's a triplet. Wait no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: for a triplet, the adjacent group has two protons (n=2, so triplet). So if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each CH2 proton would split into a triplet. Wait, but the quartet here is 4H, so it's a quartet with 4H total. So each of those four protons
