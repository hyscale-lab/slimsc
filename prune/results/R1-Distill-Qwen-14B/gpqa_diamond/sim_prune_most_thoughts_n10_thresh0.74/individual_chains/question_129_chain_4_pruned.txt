Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reaction steps provided. Let's start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the reaction scheme:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints provided. Let's take them one by one.

Hint a says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So, if compound A, when reacted with a ylide, gives an alkene, that suggests A is a carbonyl compound. Wait, but the product structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the cyclopentane. So, the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Specifically, the propan-2-ylidene group is an alkene substituent (since ylides form alkenes). So, the product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's an isopropenyl group.

So, the ylide would have provided the CH2CH2+ group, but wait, no. The Wittig reaction forms an alkene from an aldehyde or ketone. So if compound A is a ketone or aldehyde, it would form an alkene when reacted with a ylide. The product is a cyclopentane with a substituent that's an isopropenyl group. So, perhaps compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because the product after Wittig would have an alkene substituent on the ring.

Wait, but in the product structure, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C= group. Oh wait, propan-2-ylidene is more like CH2=C(CH3)-. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(1-methylvinyl)cyclopentane or something similar. But that's perhaps a side note. Let's think about what compound A is. Since the Wittig reaction forms an alkene from a carbonyl, A must be a carbonyl compound. So, compound A is likely a cyclopentanone derivative, perhaps with substituents.

Looking at the IR data in hint b. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O).
