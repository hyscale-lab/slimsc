Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products in the reaction sequence. Let's take it step by step.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to either propene or cyclopropane. But wait, the next reaction is bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond, so if A is an alkene, then it's propene. If it's cyclopropane, bromination would be different, like adding in a ring-opening maybe. I think propene is more likely here because cyclopropane's bromination isn't as common in this setup.

So, Compound A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3). It undergoes bromination with CCl4, which is a typical diaddition for alkenes. So, adding Br2 across the double bond would form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So this is likely an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (two adjacent Br atoms) react with a strong base, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So, the two Brs on adjacent carbons would be eliminated, forming a double bond. But wait, the starting dihalide is 1,2-dibromopropane, which when treated with alcoholic KOH would eliminate to form propene again? Wait, but if the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, elimination would remove two HBr molecules. Let me think: when you have Br on C1 and C2, eliminating H from C2 and Br from C1 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH3. Alternatively, maybe it's between C2 and C3? Wait, no, because with Br on C1 and C2, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH3, which is propene. So compound C is propene again. Wait, but waitâ€”another possibility: could it form 2-propene (which is the same as propene) or 1-propene
