Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1, right? The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, so the state is |l1, l2, l, m>, which represents their combined state.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So, L1z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and similarly for L2z. Each should have eigenvalues of -ħ, and we're to find the probability that both happen when we measure.

Wait, but I remember that for orbital angular momentum, the eigenvalues of Lz are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 since l=1. So if we measure L1z and L2z, each can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But the state we're in is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me parse that. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. So the coupled state has l=2, which is the sum of l1=1 and l2=1. The m here is the sum of m1 and m2, so m = m1 + m2 = -1.

I think the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a coupled state, meaning it's an eigenstate of the total L² and Lz. So when you have two particles with angular momenta l1 and l2, the total angular momentum can range from |l1-l2| to l1+l2. In this case, l=2 is the maximum possible, so the state is the highest weight state in that coupling. Wait, but wait, no—the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but if the total m is -1, then m1 + m2 = -1. Each m1 and m2 can be -1
