Okay, so I've got a physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis towards each other. The electron is coming from the left, moving to the right, and the positron is coming from the right, moving to the left. Both have Lorentz factors, which are given as 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is what's the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay, so first I need to understand the scenario. Electron and positron annihilate into two photons. Since they're matter and antimatter, they would annihilate into energy, which in this case is two photons.

I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the initial particles are moving towards each other, their combined momentum will affect the direction of the photons.

Wait, but both photons have the same energy. So, their energies are equal. Let me think about conservation laws here. Conservation of energy and conservation of momentum must hold.

Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's assume the horizontal axis is the x-axis. So, the electron's momentum is in the +x direction, and the positron's is in the -x direction.

Wait, but Lorentz factor (γ) is greater than 1, so their relativistic momenta will be γ*m*v. But since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite.

But wait, actually, the positron is moving from the right towards the left, which is the negative x-direction. The electron is moving from the left to the right, positive x-direction.

So, their momenta are in opposite directions.

But wait, the total momentum before annihilation is the sum of their momenta.

Let me think: the electron's momentum is p_e = γ_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron's is p_p = γ_p * m_p * v_p. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (left, but since direction matters, it's negative). Wait, but both are moving along the same line
