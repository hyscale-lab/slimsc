Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But each has different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag (or dimmer than 16; I always get confused with magnitude scales. Oh right, lower magnitude means brighter) would be detectable by HIRES but not necessarily ESPRESSO if it's fainter than 17.

Wait no, wait. Because the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, which means the apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, for HIRES, stars must be brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V ≤16.

So the key is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes ≤16, because that's the limit for both. Wait, no, because HIRES can only go up to 16, while ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, but brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16 because that's the stricter limit. Because if a star's apparent V is, say, 17, HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. But to be seen by both, the star must be within both limits, which would require V ≤16.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must have an apparent V mag that is ≤16 mag (since that's the stricter of the two, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES only up to 16). So any star with V ≤16 can be detected by both, because ESPRESSO can handle it, and HIRES can as well.

Wait,
