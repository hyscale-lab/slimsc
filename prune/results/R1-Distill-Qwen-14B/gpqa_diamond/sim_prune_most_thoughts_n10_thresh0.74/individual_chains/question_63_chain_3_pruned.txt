Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about a molecule transitioning between energy states when it absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of the photon required for this transition.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because in a rigid rotor, the bond length doesn't change, but in reality, bonds can stretch a bit, so the model accounts for both rotation and vibration.

The problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state for the vibration part, right? So for the vibrational energy levels, the fundamental state would be the ground state, which is n=0. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, but when the question says it's in the fundamental state, I'm a bit confused. Does that mean both the vibrational and rotational parts are in their ground states? Or just the vibrational? I think the fundamental state is the lowest possible vibrational state, which is n=0, and for rotation, it's the ground state as well, so J=0 or J=1? No, wait, J=0 is the ground rotational state for a diatomic. So the molecule is in the state where n=0 and J=0.

But the problem is asking about the next state with the lowest possible energy after absorbing a photon. So the molecule will transition to the next higher energy state. Let me think about how the energy levels are structured here.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The total energy is the sum of the rotational energy and the vibrational energy. So the vibrational energy is quantized in levels, and so is the rotational.

The fundamental state is n=0 (vibrational ground state), and the rotational ground state J=0. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher energy state. The photon's energy should match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, but what is the next state with the lowest possible energy? The next state would be the one that's closest in energy to the initial state. So the molecule can either increase its vibrational state (n increases by
