Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about some binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Hmm, binary compounds usually mean two elements, so Y and F in this case. There are five of these compounds known. 

The problem describes several substances, from A1 to A5, and their reactions. I need to figure out what each A is and then determine the molecular weight of A4.

Starting with A1: It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Oh, wait, if A1 is a strong oxidizer, maybe it's a high oxidation state of Y. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, like a peroxide or something else. 

Wait, fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe Y is in a high oxidation state here. Let me think about elements that form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. I'm thinking of elements like oxygen, but wait, oxygen and fluorine form OF2 and OF, but that's not five. Alternatively, maybe it's another element like iodine or something else.

Wait, another thought: Xenon can be oxidized under certain conditions. For example, I remember that Xe can form compounds like XeO3 or XeF2. So A1 might be a fluorine compound that's a strong oxidizing agent. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So, the decomposition reaction would break A1 into A2 and fluorine. 

Wait, the oF (I think that's the oxidation state) of F in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Let me calculate that. Wait, 31.96% of what? Oh wait, the oF is probably the oxidation state of F? Or maybe it's the percentage composition, like the mass percent of fluorine in the compound. Let me think: if A2 has fluorine at 31.96%, what would that mean?

Wait, 31.96% fluorine by mass. So if I have a compound YF_x, the mass percent of F is (19*x)/(atomic weight Y + 1
