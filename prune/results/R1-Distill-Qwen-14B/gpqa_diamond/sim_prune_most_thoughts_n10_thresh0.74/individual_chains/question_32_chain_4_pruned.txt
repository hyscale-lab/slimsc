Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, that's pretty high speed, so I think I need to use some relativistic equations here.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus in question is Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with energies and speeds, we often use the concept of relativistic energy. The total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So first, I need to find gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me calculate gamma. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))
v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation: sqrt(0.0784), hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yeah. So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². I think the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u), since each proton and neutron is roughly about 1 u. Wait, but lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so yeah, 6 u in total.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, let me calculate the exact mass.

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u

So the mass is approximately 6.047823 u. 

Wait, but wait. Wait, Li-6's actual atomic mass is about 6.015 u. Because in reality, the binding energy of the nucleus makes the mass slightly less. Oh, but wait, wait. No, the atomic mass is the sum of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. Wait, no. The atomic mass includes the electrons as well. Hmm, right. So the mass of the nucleus itself is a bit less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we can approximate the mass as 6 u. Because when people talk about heavy ion colliders, the mass is often approximated as A u, where A is the number of nucleons. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact mass based on the number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the question probably expects me to use the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus as approximately 6 u. Because when you're dealing with ions, like in a collider, the mass
