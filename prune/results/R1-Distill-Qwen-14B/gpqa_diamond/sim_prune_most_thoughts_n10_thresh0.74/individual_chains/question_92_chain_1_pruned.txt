Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, it's a hydrocarbon with some double bonds and branching, I think. 

The question provides some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. And then bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh wait, the options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation, which is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like this, it would involve calculating the energy released or absorbed when the compound is formed from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

But to calculate the enthalpy of formation, I think I can use the bond energies. The general approach is to consider the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

Wait, but wait, the way I remember it is that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula: 

ΔH°f = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, when forming a molecule from its elements, you're starting with atoms. So,
