Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled notes next to it. The note is about a "size estimate" with a formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The task is to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram affects the order of the terms in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and also some factors from integrals, like from the loop momentum integrations.

The general idea is that the amplitude of a Feynman diagram is proportional to a certain power of the coupling constants and other factors. The number of loops is related to the number of vertices and propagators, but I think the key here is to look at the scaling with the number of loops.

Loop diagrams contribute terms that are higher in perturbation order. Each loop adds a factor of (something like) the coupling constant and also introduces a factor from the loop integral. The loop integrals often involve factors of 4π and possibly powers of the loop momentum. But wait, the exact factors can vary depending on the specifics of the diagram, but for the purpose of this question, perhaps the scaling with the number of loops is what matters.

Looking at the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

Let me break down each part.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), each photon vertex contributes a factor of alpha, and each loop might add more factors, but wait, no, in vertices, each photon emission or absorption brings an e (the charge), and alpha is e^2/(4π), so each vertex would have a factor of alpha. But for a loop, the number of vertices would be related to the number of edges in the diagram. Alternatively, for a loop diagram, the number of loops can be related to the number of vertices and propagators via the formula L = (V - P + 1)/2, where L is the number of loops, V the number of vertices, and P the number of propagators. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, when considering the scaling with the number of loops, each loop contributes a certain number of factors. For example, in a one-loop diagram, you might have a factor of alpha (if it's an electron loop in QED), and perhaps some factors from the integral, like 1/(4π)^2 or something similar. Wait, the loop integrals typically involve factors like 1/(16π^2) per loop, because in four dimensions, the loop integral for a scalar loop would involve integrating d^4k, which after a Wick rotation becomes d^4k_E, and when you evaluate it, you often get factors like (1/(16π^2)) times some logarithmic terms or such.

Wait, but in the given expression, there's a
