Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures but the same molecule. Like in ketones and aldehydes, but wait, tautomerism is more about keto-enol tautomerism. So, compounds that can enolize would show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is C6H4O2. I think it's a cyclic di-ketone. Wait, no, benzoquinone is more like two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So it's 1,4-benzoquinone, maybe. So two ketone groups opposite each other on the ring.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each adjacent carbon has a ketone. Wait, no, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So three ketones in the ring.

Now, can these compounds undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen between two atoms, typically in conjugation. For example, in a diketone, I think the enol form is possible. So if a compound has adjacent carbonyl groups, it can tautomerize.

Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on opposite sides of the ring. Are they conjugated? They are on a benzene ring, so they're conjugated through the aromatic system. But wait, for enol tautomerism, you need adjacent carbonyl groups, right? Like in 1,2-diketones. Because in such cases, the hydrogen can shift from the alpha carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, creating an enol.

Benzoquinone, with the two carbonyl groups across the ring (para positions), are they adjacent? No, they
