Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons. If it's di-substituted, that means two substituents attached. So the total is 6 plus 2 substituents, but wait, the substituents could contribute more carbons. Oh wait, the total is 8 carbons. So the benzene ring is 6, plus two substituents which add up to 2 carbons. Or wait, no: substituents could have more. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are attached to the ring, and each substituent can have multiple carbons. The ring itself is 6, so substituents must add up to 2 carbons in total? Or wait, maybe each substituent is one carbon each, but that's not possible because then 6+2=8. But that wouldn't make sense if the substituents are, say, groups like -OCH3 or something. Wait, no, each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So how does the total carbons add up?

Wait, let's think. The compound is a di-substituted benzene. So benzene is 6 carbons. Each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So the substituents can be, for example, a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and something else, maybe a halogen? Because the question says the FTIR has a carbonyl peak (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (X, like Cl or Br).

So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, substituents on benzene are usually in positions that are either ortho, meta, or para. But since it's di-substituted, they could be in any position.

Wait, but the substituents themselves: a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be a C=O. So that's one substituent. The other substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br attached directly. Wait, but the problem says the FTIR has both a carbonyl peak and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (
