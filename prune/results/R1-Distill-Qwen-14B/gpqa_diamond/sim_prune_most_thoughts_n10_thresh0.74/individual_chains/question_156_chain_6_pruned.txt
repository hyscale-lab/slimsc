Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both reactions involve treating with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each case.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of an alkene typically forms an epoxide. So, for each starting alkene, adding mCPBA would form an epoxide. But wait, the alkene configuration is different for E and Z isomers.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA â†’ forms an epoxide. Then treated with aqueous acid. Oh wait, I think when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. The mechanism for that is protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then a nucleophilic attack occurs, but since it's aqueous acid, water is the nucleophile. So the epoxide ring opens via SN2 mechanism, leading to diol formation.

Wait, but wait a minute. The initial reaction is epoxidation. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form with the substituents on opposite sides. Then, when the epoxide opens with acid, the diol's stereochemistry depends on the configuration of the epoxide and the mechanism of the ring opening.

Wait, but mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that adds across the alkene to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide would form with different configurations.

Let me think. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the alk
