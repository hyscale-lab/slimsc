Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian H (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. Oh wait, wait. The transition energy ΔE is given with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series, right? Because I remember the Balmer wavelength is about 486 nm, which is 0.486 micrometers. So ΔE would be the energy corresponding to that transition.

So first, I need to find the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think involves the magnetic dipole interaction. The Hamiltonian for that would be something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron in orbit is given by μ = -g_l * μ_B * L, where g_l is the Landé g-factor (which for orbital angular momentum is approximately 1), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, but wait, I think the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman term. Oh right, the Zeeman effect is about the interaction of a magnetic field with the magnetic moment of an atom. So in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split due to this interaction.

So the Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ·B. For an electron, μ = g_l * (eħ)/(2m_e) * L, and since B is along the z-axis, the dot product becomes μ_z * B. So H_Zeeman = -g_l * (μ_B) * m * B, because L_z is ħ m, so m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, m is the quantum number, L_z = ħ m, so the magnetic moment μ_z = g_l * μ_B * m. So the Hamiltonian is H = -μ_z * B = -g_l * μ_B * m * B.

Wait wait, but wait. The expectation value of H would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So <H> = -g_l * μ_B * m * B. Since m can be small, as per the question, but B is 1 T.

But what's the magnitude of this term compared to the transition energy ΔE?

So I need to calculate both terms. Let's start with ΔE. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. Using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light.

Let me get the numbers right. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. So hc is about 1.986 x 10^-16 J·m. Then, λ is 486.1 nm, which is 486.1 x 10^-9 meters. So ΔE = (1.986e-16 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) ≈ (1.986e-16) / (4.861e-7) ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 1.986e-16 by 4.861e-7: 1.986 / 4.861 is approximately 0.408. Then the exponents: e-16 / e-7 is e-9. So 0.408e-9 J. Wait, that's 4.08e-10 J. But I need to convert that to electron volts because often energies are compared in eV. Since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.08e-10 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.548e9 eV. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, 4.08e-10 J is how much in eV?

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So (4.08e-10 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) = (4.08 / 1.602) x 10^(9) eV ≈ 2.548e9 eV? That's way too high. Wait, that can't be right because the energy levels in hydrogen are much smaller. Oh wait, wait, wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, the hydrogen transition from n=2 to n=1 is about 102 nm (which is 102.9 nm), corresponding to around 10.2 eV. But here the transition is 486 nm, which is longer, so lower energy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate. Let me compute hc/(lambda) correctly.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 486.1e-9 m

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.98
