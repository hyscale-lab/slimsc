Okay, so I have this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, so the scenario is that there's this advanced civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast, almost the speed of light.

The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to get to Earth. The question is asking how long the trip would take from the astronaut's perspective. The options give different possibilities, including the astronaut dying before reaching Earth, or taking about 70-something years.

I remember that when traveling at such high speeds, time dilation comes into play due to Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation means that time passes slower for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth). So from the astronaut's point of view, the trip would take less time than it would from Earth's frame of reference.

Wait, but wait. The question is specifically about how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective. So I think I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I need to find out how far Earth is from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, I don't have the exact distance, but maybe we can approximate it. I think the average distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. Let me pick an average, maybe around 170,000 light-years. So the distance is approximately 1.7e5 light-years.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. Let me compute the time from Earth's perspective first. Time equals distance divided by speed. So 170,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, when you divide that by c (speed of light), the time in years is just the distance in light-years divided by the speed factor.

So 170,000 / 0.99999987 is roughly 170,000 / 1, which is 170,000 years. Wait, but that's from Earth's frame. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. So the proper length is longer than the length measured in their frame. Wait, actually, in the astronaut's frame, the distance is shorter. Because length contraction happens in the direction of motion. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame), and L is the length in the astronaut's frame.

Wait, wait, wait. So to compute the time from the astronaut's perspective, I need to calculate the contracted distance divided by their speed.

Let me get the exact formulas straight. The proper time (time experienced by the astronaut) is given by the spacetime interval: tau = t^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/c^2, all under the square root. But perhaps an easier way is to use
