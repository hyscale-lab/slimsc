Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a bunch of data: mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are four different chlorinated aromatic compounds, so I need to figure out which one matches the data.

First, I'll start with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Wait, molecular ion peaks usually indicate the molecular weight. So, the molecular weight is around 156. The peak at 158 is close—could that be a fragment or maybe a different isotope? Wait, chlorine has an isotope at about 35 and 37. So, if the molecular formula has a Cl, the molecular ion would typically show two peaks, like a doublet at m/z around 156 and 158. Oh right, because Cl has a 3:1 ratio for the isotopes, but the molecular ion might split into two peaks. So the molecular weight is 156, but with Cl, so the exact mass would be a bit higher. Let me think: molecular formula could be something with a Cl and a benzene ring.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H stretching. But wait, the broad region here is pretty wide, maybe due to an -OH group. But wait, benzaldehyde's aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm in NMR. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be a very broad peak, maybe around 2500-3300, but the given IR here is 3500-2700, which is a bit lower. Wait, another possibility is an aldehyde, but wait, the aldehyde proton in NMR is a sharp singlet around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe a carbonyl group—like a ketone, ester, or acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl. 1720 is in the range for a carboxylic acid (usually higher, around 1700 or so, but can vary) or maybe an ester, like around 1740 or so. Wait, also, for a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. Hmm, 1720 could be a ketone, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually a bit lower, like around 1680-1720. So 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. Maybe an ester? Or maybe a chloroformate?

Looking at the NMR data. Let's see. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which is quite downfield. That could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait
