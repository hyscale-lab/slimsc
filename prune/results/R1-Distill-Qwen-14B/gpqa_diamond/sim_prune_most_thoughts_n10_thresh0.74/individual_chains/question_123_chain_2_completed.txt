Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because if one frame sees the other moving at 60,000 km/s, the other sees the first moving at the same speed but opposite direction due to the principle of relativity. Oh wait, no, that's only if they are inertial frames moving at a constant relative velocity, which they are here. So yeah, the speeds are the same magnitude but opposite direction in each other's frames.

But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I guess I need to find out how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame during those 50 seconds of ejecta time.

Oh right, this involves time dilation because of special relativity. The two frames (ejecta and galaxy) are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, the time experienced in each frame isn't the same.

The speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into a fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light, so that's v = 0.2c.

The time experienced in the galaxy's frame (t) and the ejecta's frame (t') are related by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In this case, v is 0.2c. So v²/c² is 0.04. Then 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. The square root of 0.96 is about 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So if t' is 50 seconds, then t is approximately 1.0206 * 50. Let me compute that. 50 * 1.0206 is 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but wait! Because in the galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance it travels is speed multiplied by time. So distance d = v * t.

So v is 60,000 km/s, and t is 51.03 seconds.

Calculating that: 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = let me compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. Then 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800. So 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close. Maybe my approximation of gamma was a bit off. Let me calculate gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

What's sqrt(0.96)? Let me think. 0.96 is 96/100 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796. So gamma is 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.020612.

So t = 50 * 1.020612 ≈ 51.0306 seconds.

So distance is 60,000 *51.0306 = let me compute that.

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.0306 = let's see, 60,000 *1=60,000; 60,000 * 0.0306 = 1,836. So total 60,000 + 1,836 = 61,836. So total d=3,000,000 +61,836=3,061,836 km.

Wait, the options don't have that exact number. The closest is option D (3,060,000) and option C is 2,880,000, which is way lower.

Wait, did I make a mistake here. Maybe I should have considered length contraction instead. No, wait, the time experienced in the galaxy is longer than the ejecta's time. So the galaxy sees the ejecta moving for longer, hence more distance.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the frames. Wait, the question says: from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 towards the galaxy.

Wait, but the problem is, the time experienced in the ejecta is 50 seconds, and we need to find how much the ejecta travels in Galaxy's frame. So in Galaxy's frame, the time is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate how much time passes in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, the time intervals aren't the same.

The gamma factor is for the frame where the event is moving. So the time in the galaxy (stationary frame) would be longer than the moving frame (ejecta). So yes, t = gamma * t' = about 51.03 seconds.

So the distance in galaxy's frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D, 3,060,000 km. But wait, maybe the approximation of gamma is exact when considering beta is 0.2. Let me compute gamma exactly.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/ sqrt(0.96) = approximately 1.020612.

So t = 50 * 1.020612 = 51.0306 seconds.

So distance is 60,000 *51.0306 = 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 plus 60,000 *0.0306=1,836. So 3,061,836 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem? Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says: "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. During that time, how much has the ejecta moved in the Galaxy's frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So the distance is v multiplied by that longer time.

Wait, but another way: in the ejecta frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s, so the distance between the galaxy's center and the ejecta is decreasing at that speed. So in the ejecta's frame, the distance covered is 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

But wait, that's the distance in the ejecta's frame. But the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy frame. So due to length contraction, perhaps?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So the distance the galaxy covers in that frame is v * t' = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But according to the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at v. So the distance the ejecta travels is v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.

But the time in the galaxy's frame is longer than t'. So t = gamma * t'. So t = 50 * gamma.

So d = v * gamma * t' = 60,000 * 1.020612 * 50 = 60,000 * 51.0306 ≈ 3,061,836 km.

Wait, but the options don't include this. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1/sqrt(0.96) precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using relative velocity and not time dilation? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake in which frame observes which.

Wait, another approach: the distance in the Galaxy frame is just v multiplied by the time in Galaxy frame. So the time in Galaxy frame is longer than the ejecta's time.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is:

In the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 s. How much time passes in the Galaxy's frame, t?

Since the two frames are moving at speed v relative to each other, the time t in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'.

So, v = 60,000 km/s. Let's compute gamma.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v is 60,000 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s. So v/c is 0.2.

So (v/c)^2 = 0.04. 1 -0.04 =0.96. sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03 s.

Distance d = v * t =60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km. Hmm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km. So perhaps that's the intended answer, considering rounding.

Wait, but let me calculate gamma more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

0.96 is 96/100. sqrt(96)/10. sqrt(96)= approx 9.798. So sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.9798. So gamma=1.020612.

So t=50 *1.020612=51.0306 s.

d=60,000 *51.0306 = 60,000 *51.0306.

Compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000; 60,000 *0.0306=1,836. So total d=3,061,836 km.

But none of the options match exactly. The options are A) 2,940,000, B)3,000,000, C)2,880,000, D)3,060,000.

Hmm, so option D is 3,060,000, which is 3,060,000. Our calculation is 3,061,836, which is about 3,060,000 plus 1,836. That's a difference of about 0.06%.

Wait, perhaps the approximation of gamma is taken as 1.02, which would give t=50 *1.02=51 s. Then d=60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, exactly option D.

So maybe that's the intended approach. So the answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames moving at a relative velocity of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)).

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Dilation**: The time experienced in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**: The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy arises from rounding the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)) to \( 1.02 \) instead of using a more precise value, which simplifies the calculation to match the given options.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
