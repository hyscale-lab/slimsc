Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means it has two substituents, right? And the ring is 6-membered, so that's benzene or something similar. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Hmm, benzene has six carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons in total.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, carbonyl could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something. And an aromatic-halogen bond implies that one of the substituents is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

Wait, but we have two substituents. So one substituent is a halogen, and another is a carbonyl-containing group. Or maybe both substituents are halogens, but that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl would require more carbons.

Wait, no, the total carbon count is 8. Benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent probably adds one carbon. But wait, if there are two substituents, each with one carbon, that's two carbons in total.

Wait, but let me think again. For example, if one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), that's just one substituent, but doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent would have to be a group that adds two carbons. That would make total substituent carbons as 2, plus the benzene 6, making 8.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl is part of a substituent. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Let's think: for example, a benzophenone derivative, but no, that's more than six carbons. Wait, no, the substituent would be a single carbon with a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a substituent like an acetyl group (COCH3) or a formyl group (CHO). Because each of those adds one carbon (the methyl in acetyl or the H in formyl). So let's see:

If one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) and the other
