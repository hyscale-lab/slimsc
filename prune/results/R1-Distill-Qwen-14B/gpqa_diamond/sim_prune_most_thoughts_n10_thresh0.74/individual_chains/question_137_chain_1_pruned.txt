Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons. 

Wait, cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, right? They use a magnetic field and an electric field that alternates. The particles move in a circular path, and each time they pass through the electric field, they gain energy. But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a bit different, isn't it? Oh right, it's also called a variable-resonance cyclotron because it can handle particles with varying speeds. So the magnetic field isn't constant in time, but I think the electric field alternates as well.

The problem says the proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Oh wait, no, the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV? Or is it that the voltage is applied with some function? Let me re-read the problem.

The voltage U(t) is given by U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. So I need to find out how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, in cyclotrons, the number of revolutions is related to the time it takes to reach a certain energy. Since the proton is being accelerated
