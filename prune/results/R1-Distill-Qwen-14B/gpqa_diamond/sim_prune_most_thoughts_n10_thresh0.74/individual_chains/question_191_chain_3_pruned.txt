Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let's picture that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a -CH2OH), and at position 5, a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which I think is like a cyclopropane substituent? Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)-, no wait, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH(CH2) with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's like a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexane at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating things. But wait, benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So perhaps we're doing an alkylation here. But where?

In the starting compound, the ketone is at position 1. Wait, but ketones can undergo enolate formation. So maybe it's an enolate alkylation. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the alpha carbon of the ketone. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. So the cyclohexanone has carbons 2 and 6 (maybe) as alpha positions. But wait, the substituents are at 3 and 5, so maybe the alpha positions are 2 and 6.

So deprotonating alpha to the ketone, then adding benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group there. So the product 1 would have a benzyl group attached to the alpha carbon. Which alpha? Well, probably the less substituted one based on steric factors, but maybe in this case, both are similar. So perhaps either position 2 or 6 would get a benzyl group.

Wait, but the starting material already has substituents at 3 and 5. So to form the enolate, the base would abstract a proton from either position 2 or 6. Let's imagine the cyclohexanone is in a chair conformation. The ketone is at position 1. The substituents are at 3 (hydroxymethyl) and 5 (prop-1-en-2-yl). So if the enolate forms at position 2, adding benzyl bromide would add a benzyl group there. Alternatively, position 6 could be deprotonated, but the substituents are at 3 and 5, so maybe position 2 is more accessible.

So product 1 would have a benzyl group added at position 2. So the structure would be benzyl group attached to C2, hydroxymethyl at C3, and prop-1-en-2-yl at C5. And the ketone is still at C1.

Wait, but the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So when we add benzyl, the cyclohexanone's ketone is at 1, and adding benzyl to position 2 would give a new substituent there.

Next step: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in presence of catalytic HCl, forming product 2.

Hmm, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide is used in the Curtius rearrangement or the Hofmann degradation, but wait, more accurately, when a carbonyl is treated with this reagent, it forms a hydrazonesulfonamide or something similar. Alternatively, it could be a way to form a hydrazone, which upon heating would
