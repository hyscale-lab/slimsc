Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about isomers and some properties of specific compounds. I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. The question breaks them down into constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structural arrangements, while stereoisomers are about the spatial arrangement—like how the atoms are arranged in space, such as in geometric or optical isomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds. For example, in compounds with conjugated double bonds or enol forms. Part B asks which of two compounds shows optical isomerism, which has to do with stereoisomerism where the molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to different optical activities.

So, looking at the compounds given: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. Then, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate for part B.

Let me tackle part A first. Which of these two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. Benzoquinone is, I think, a cyclic diketone. Its structure is like a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, it's O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. But regardless, it's a diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So, the structure is O=C-(cyclohexane ring with two more ketones opposite each other). Wait, no, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon in the ring, making three ketones.

Now, tautomerism usually requires the presence of adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can shift. For example, in furan derivatives or in enols. Benzoquinone has two ketones. Can it tautomerize? Well, I think that in some cases, especially if there are adjacent double bonds, but benzoquinone has a conjugated diene structure. Wait, wait, benzoquinone is a fully conjugated ring with two ketones. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but in reality, it's a conjugated system with alternating double bonds and ketones. Wait, no, the structure is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the 1,4 positions (para) as ketones. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but the ring is fully conjugated with three double bonds. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O, which is a cyclic diketone.

But wait, another thought: can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione—does that have any possibility for tautomerism? Let me think about the structure. It's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at
