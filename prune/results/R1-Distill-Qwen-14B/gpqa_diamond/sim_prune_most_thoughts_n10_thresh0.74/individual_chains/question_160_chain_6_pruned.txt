Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon with all apothems of length a. When a monochromatic light hits it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity.

Wait, wait. N is infinitely large. Oh right, when N becomes very large, the polygon would approximate a circle. So the problem is probably similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

But wait, the polygon has all apothems of the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N), since each side is subtended by an angle of 2π/N at the center. But if N is very large, then π/N becomes very small. So cos(π/N) approximates to 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but maybe for our purposes, we can approximate a ≈ R when N is large. So R ≈ a for N→infinity. So the polygon's size becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, but for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is given by a = (s/(2 tan(π/N))), where s is the side length. But since N is large, tan(π/N) is approximately π/N, so a ≈ s/(2*(π/N)) )= s*N/(2π). So s ≈ (2π a)/N. But since N is large, s is small, so each side becomes a tiny segment of a circle.

But maybe I'm getting sidetracked. The key is that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is the same as a circular aperture.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction (far field) for a circular aperture, the minima occur at certain angles. The first minima are at θ = λ/(π a), I think. Because the formula for the minima in circular apertures is given by sinθ = n λ / (π a), where n is the order. Wait, no, wait. The minima occur when the Bessel function J1
