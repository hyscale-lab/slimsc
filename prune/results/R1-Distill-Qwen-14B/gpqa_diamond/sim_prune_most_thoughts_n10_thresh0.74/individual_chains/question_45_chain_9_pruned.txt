Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the energy levels of four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this, but I need to think carefully.

Alright, the well is of length L, and each particle is a spin-1/2, so they can be either up or down. But wait, the potential well is one-dimensional, right? So each particle's energy is determined by its quantum number. Oh right, the energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh wait, the question says E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each n² * E would be the energy for that state. So E_n = n² * E.

But wait, these are four spin-1/2 particles. So because they are fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the main quantum number is n, but since spin is 1/2, each orbital can hold 2 particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, let's think about how their quantum numbers would fill up. The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration.

In the ground state, the lowest energy levels are filled first, considering each can hold 2 particles. So let's see. The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles, the next (n=2) can hold another 2, since each n can have two spins. Wait, but wait, for four particles, we might not need to go beyond n=2.

Wait, but each energy level n can hold 2 particles because of spin. So for four particles, how are they filled? Let me think. Let's list the possible n and their capacities.

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles
n=3: 2 particles
n=4: 2 particles
and so on.

But since we
