Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here since the question is about photospheric compositions. Maybe the masses are just extra info, but I'll keep them in mind in case they come into play later.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not too clear on that. Oh wait, I remember that the EW method is used to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by measuring the strength of spectral lines. So, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun.

So the data provided is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So for Star_1, the ratio of silicon to iron is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. For Star_2, magnesium to silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Star_1's iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Star_2's magnesium to hydrogen is same as Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but what are we asked to find? The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi_1 / nSi_2)?

How to approach this. Maybe I can find the abundance of silicon in each star relative to hydrogen, then take the ratio.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = 1. So, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) = 0 → nFe/nH = 10^0 = 1.

Wait, wait. No, the [X/H] notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) for the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log10(nFe/nH) = 0 (since for the Sun, it's 7.5, but wait the given formula is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5, so Sun's nFe/nH is 10^-4.5.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused
