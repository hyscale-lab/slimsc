Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain part of the Sun's reactions stops. Hmm, I need to think this through step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun to Earth, right? So if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we're seeing the effects now on Earth. But how does that affect the neutrino flux?

I remember that the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which produces energy in the Sun. There are different branches: I, II, and III. The main one is the pp-I branch, which is the dominant process. PP-II and PP-III are minor branches. Oh wait, the question specifically says the pp-III branch stopped, not the others. So other reactions, like pp-I and CNO cycle, are still going as usual.

Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the fusion reactions. PP-I and the CNO cycle produce neutrinos. PP-III, I think, produces a different type, maybe more high-energy neutrinos? Or maybe it's a branch that affects the overall neutrino production.

Wait, neutrino production in the Sun comes mainly from two processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain contributes about 85% of the solar neutrinos, and the CNO contributes about 1
