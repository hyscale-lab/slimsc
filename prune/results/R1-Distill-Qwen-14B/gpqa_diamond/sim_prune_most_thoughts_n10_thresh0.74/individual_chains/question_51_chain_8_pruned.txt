Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: If a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. We need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done in assembling charges. But wait, the sphere is conducting and it's grounded. Oh right, grounding means the sphere is connected to the Earth, which is a large conductor, so any excess charge will go to the earth. Wait, but wait, if the sphere is grounded, it won't have any net charge unless something induces it. Oh wait, noâ€”grounding allows charges to flow to and from the earth. So in this case, the charge on the sphere would adjust based on the external charge.

So the setup is: a point charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere. The sphere is neutral to begin with because it's grounded. When the charge q is placed near, it induces charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges will adjust until the electric potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground. Wait, but the sphere is a conductor, so the charges should reside on the surface.

Wait, when you place a charge near a conducting sphere, charges are induced on the sphere. For a grounded sphere, the induced charges will be such that the sphere's potential equals the ground potential. Since the ground is at zero potential, the sphere's potential must also be zero.

So the induced charge on the sphere will be such that the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere at the surface of the sphere is zero. Wait, but the sphere's own induced charge will create a potential that cancels the potential from the external charge.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of method of images. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be thought of as an image charge inside the sphere. Oh wait, but the sphere is grounded, so the image charge method might still apply, but the image charge would adjust so that the sphere remains at zero potential.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the potential at the surface due to the external charge q and set it equal to the potential due to the induced charges, ensuring the total is zero.

Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so all points on its surface are
