Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of an outside observer. But wait, the question is asking about the astronaut's own experience, right? So I need to think about time dilation from the astronaut's point of view.

The problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c, like almost light speed. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is about 150 solar years. Wait, that's from their own perspective, I think. Or maybe it's their normal lifespan on their home planet, not considering relativistic effects. Hmm, not sure yet.

So the main thing here is figuring out the time experienced by the astronaut. I remember that for the traveler (the astronaut), the journey time is shorter because of time dilation. Wait, no, actually, from their frame of reference, it's the distance that's contracted. So the distance to Earth would appear shorter, which would make the trip take less time for them.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? Let me think. The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me settle on an approximate figure. Maybe 163,000 light-years as an average. So the distance is about 163,000 light-years.

But wait, the astronaut's speed is 0.99999987c. So, v is approximately 0.99999987c, which is really close to c. So the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) would be the distance divided by speed, but in their own frame. But wait, no, because from their frame, the distance is contracted.

Oh wait, right. The proper time τ is calculated using the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v is so close to c, gamma will be a large number.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because sometimes people calculate the time from the Earth's frame versus the spaceship's frame.

Wait, the question is: how long does the trip take from the astronaut's
