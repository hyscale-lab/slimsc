Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about these reactions. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I need to figure out what major product is formed here.

Wait, let me break this down. First, I should recall what a cyclopent-1-enol looks like. Cyclopentenol is a five-membered ring with an -OH group attached to the cyclopentene ring. But wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol... so the ring is cyclopentene (a five-membered ring with a double bond) and there's an hydroxyl group (OH) on carbon 1, and methyl groups on carbon 4.

Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: cyclopent-1-enol would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, I think. Because the numbering in cyclopentenol starts so that the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond from C1 to C2, and an OH group on C1. Oh, wait no, wait: in cyclopentenol, the OH is on the same carbon as the double bond. So the structure is cyclopent-1-en-1-ol? Or maybe cyclopent-1-en-3-ol? Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait,
