Okay, so I need to figure out which two aromatic compounds are present in the mixture based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14, so both compounds are aromatic and have substituents that add up to that formula. Let me think about the question step by step.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally. The aromatic region at 6.7 ppm is probably due to equivalent protons in each structure.

Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The 2:1:1 suggests that one of the substituents has two equivalent protons, and the others have one each. Wait, but wait, 2.2 ppm is usually for methyl groups attached to something deactivating, like oxygen or another group, maybe. But since the molecular formula is C10H14, and the options are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has diethyl groups.

Wait, the options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-TM and 1,2,3,5-TM
B) 1,2,4,5-TM and 1,2,3,4-TM
C) 1,2,3,5-TM and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-TM and 1,2,3,5-TM

So all except option C are tetramethylbenzenes. The other option C includes diethyl, which would have more protons, but let's think about the NMR.

The aromatic region: the two singlets at 6.7 ppm, each from one compound. So each compound must have equivalent aromatic protons. So how?

If a compound is para-substituted, like 1,4-diethyl, that would have equivalent protons. But for the other, if it's a tetramethyl, how would that work?

Wait, looking at the NMR data, the aromatic signals are two singlets. So each compound must have only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, right? Because the mixture shows two signals, each from each compound.
