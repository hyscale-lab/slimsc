Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. That's probably the exo position because norbornene derivatives often have substituents in specific positions.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source. The reaction conditions sound like an elimination or maybe a substitution. Wait, waitâ€”dibromomethyl groups are present. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. Oh, and when you have dibromomethyl groups, sodium iodide would likely abstract a bromide, leading to a substitution. But maybe it's more about elimination?

Alternatively, I think of this as a Diels-Alder reaction. The starting diene is the norbornene, and the dienophile might be the cyclohexadiene derivative. But wait, the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups. Wait, no, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a diene itself. Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic diene. Hmm. Maybe the cyclohexadiene is acting as a dienophile?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The starting material is a norbornene derivative. Then it's reacting with another diene, but with two dibromomethyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a Diels-Alder.

Wait, but sodium iodide is present. Maybe it's a substitution reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So perhaps the norbornene is attacking the cyclohexene?

Wait, another thought: the cyclohexa-1,3-d
