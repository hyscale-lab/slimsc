Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. We need to identify the final product. The data given includes IR and NMR spectra. Let's start by analyzing the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is.

Looking at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, possibly from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so there's probably an aromatic ring involved.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's list them out:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. High chemical shift like that usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But the IR has a peak at 1720, which could support a carboxylic acid group since their carbonyls are around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 2800 (stretching) but in IR, 1720 is a bit high for an aldehyde (which is more like 2820 and 2720 for the stretch and the C-H), but maybe I'm mixing this up. Wait, no, the 1720 is the carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl, and a high shift proton, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR peak in 3400-2500 could also mean an -OH stretch for a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300, so that fits. So maybe the 10.5 is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. So that fits.

Wait, but another possibility is that the 10.5 is an aldehyde proton. Let me think: aldehydes have
