Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that they've done an experiment with three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene, made double mutants, and tested their resistance against the fungal disease. The wild-type has a 100% resistance, but when they mutate these genes, the resistance levels drop.

The results given are:
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. I remember that in gene interaction studies, the effect on the phenotype can tell us about the genetic pathways. If a gene is a transcription factor upstream, its knockout would affect downstream genes. Epistasis comes into play here—epistatic genes are those whose effects mask the effects of other genes.

So, let's think about the data. 

First, looking at g2: it has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor because the question says at least one is upstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Next, G1's mutant has 75% resistance, which is a 25% reduction. G3's mutant is 50%, so halfway. So G3 is more critical than G1, perhaps.

Now the double mutants: 

g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, regardless of G1 or G3, the resistance is zero. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutant, even if G1 or G3 is present, the absence of G2 leads to no resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about g1g3? Its resistance is 10%, which is even lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. Hmm, that suggests that G1 and G3 might function in parallel pathways. Because knocking out both makes it worse than either alone. Or maybe they work together. Wait, but the double mutant's effect is less than additive.

Wait, if G1 and G3 were in the same pathway, then the double mutant would be similar to the more severe single mutant. But here, g1g3 is worse than both. So perhaps they function in separate pathways, and each contributes to resistance. So in that case, knocking both out removes both contributions, leading to lower resistance.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate other genes (like G1 and G3). So, without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, so their knockouts wouldn't matter because they're already not active.

Wait, in the case of the double mutant g1g2: both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then in g2, G1 wouldn't be expressed anyway. So, in the double mutant, you're just adding G1 knockout to a background where G1 isn't expressed due to G2 knockout. So how does that affect the phenotype? It would be the same as g2 alone, which is 0% resistance. Which is what we see. Similarly, g2g3 would be 0%, same as g2.

But what about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So what's the interaction between G1 and G3?

If G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then the double mutant would have additive effects. Let's say each contributes 25% and 50% respectively. Then together, their combined effect would be 25% +50% =75%. But the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps they're in a redundant pathway. Redundancy usually means that either can compensate, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can take over the function of the other. So, in a single mutant (g1 or g3), you still have some function. But when both are knocked out, you lose that function entirely. So in that case, the double mutant would be worse than either single.

Looking at the data: g1 is 75% (so 25% loss), g3 is 50% (50% loss), and the double is 10% (90% loss). So in terms of effect, it's much worse than either. That suggests redundancy because when both are missing, you lose both possible contributions.

So, putting it together: G2 is a transcription factor, because its knockout (g2) leads to 0% resistance, which is the most severe. The other genes, G1 and G3, when knocked out singly, have lower resistance, but not as bad as G2. The double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are as bad as g2, which makes sense because G2 is upstream and needed for G1 and G3 function.

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 must be in a redundant pathway. Because each can contribute to resistance, but when both are gone, the effect is much worse. So redundancy.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. But our analysis says G2 is the TF, not G1. So A is probably wrong.

Option B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm, same promoter suggests they're in the same pathway, but perhaps G3 is upstream of G1. But how does that explain the g1g3 data? If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the double mutant would be as bad as the more severe single mutant. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit. Also, same promoter would mean they're co-regulated, perhaps. Not sure.

Option C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy means one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that applies here. The data doesn't directly show pleiotropy, but more about gene interactions. Also, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in g1g3, the phenotype would resemble g1. But in our case, g1g3 is worse than both, which is the opposite of what epistasis would predict if G1 is epistatic.

Option D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either. So the 10% in g1g3 makes sense. But what about epistasis here? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 would mask G3's effect. But in the data, without G1, you have 75% (which is better than without G3 at 50%). So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Or maybe not directly related.

Wait, but when G2 is present, G1 and G3 have their own effects. When G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't function, so their absence doesn't matter. So the main point is that G2 is upstream.

So, the conclusions are:

- G2 is the transcription factor (since its knockout is the most severe).

- G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway. Because their double mutant is worse than either single mutant.

- The epistatic relationship: G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, since in the double mutants with G2 knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of G1 or G3 status.

Now looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, does G1 being epistatic to G3 fit? If G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1 would mask G3's effect. But in the data, G3's effect is more severe than G1's. G3's mutant is 50% resistance, which is worse than G1's 75%. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which suggests that each contributes, so redundancy.

So in redundancy, each gene can contribute, so when both are missing, the effect is additive or worse. So, in terms of epistasis, maybe G3 is epistatic to G1? Because in the single mutant g3, resistance is lower (50%) than g1 (75%). So without G3, the resistance is worse. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but what's the definition of epistasis here? If G3 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G3's pathway is downstream of G1. Because the phenotype of G3 mutant would mask the effect of G1.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G3 is necessary for G1's function. So if G3 is missing, G1 can't function. But that doesn't fit because in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So perhaps they function in parallel pathways, which is redundancy.

So in that case, the question is about epistasis between G1 and G3. Since their double mutant is worse than either, perhaps they are in redundant pathways and neither is epistatic. But the options don't have that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. If G1 is epistatic, that would mean that G1's effect is upstream or masks G3's. But when you have a G1 knockout, the effect is 75%, which is better than G3's 50%. So if G1 were epistatic, then G3's effect would be seen only when G1 is present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is epistatic towards G1. Because in the double mutant, the resistance is 10%, worse than either. But how does that fit with epistasis?

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic, so the function of G3 is more critical. So without G3, even if G1 is present, its function doesn't matter because G3 is upstream. But in that case, the double mutant would be as bad as the G3 single mutant. But in our data, it's worse, which suggests that they're additive, which would support redundancy.

So, perhaps the correct option is D. Because in option D, G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but redundancy and epistasis don't directly align. Redundancy is when both genes contribute similarly, but if they are in the same pathway, then perhaps one is epistatic.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway (so their double mutant is worse than either), and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, which is correct because when G2 is out, the phenotype is 0%, regardless of G1.

Wait, the options are about the conclusions regarding the interactions. So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, which is upstream, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this?

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Not sure about that last part.

Option A says G1 is a TF, which we don't think so.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. Which would suggest that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (redundant). So each contributes some level of resistance. So without both, the resistance drops more.

So redundancy would fit. So which option has that?

Option D says they show gene redundancy. So that's correct for that part.

Now, the question is about which gene is epistatic towards another.

In the double mutant g1g3, their combined effect is worse than either. So in this case, neither is epistatic; their effects are additive. So perhaps they are in separate pathways, which is what redundancy implies.

So, going back to the options, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both. Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I don't see how G1 is epistatic towards G3. Because when G1 is out, resistance is 75%, and when G3 is out, it's 50%. So G3's single mutant is worse. So perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but what's the epistatic relationship? If G3 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that G3 is downstream of G1. So in the pathway, when G3 is missing, it doesn't matter if G1 is present—its effect is masked. But in the single mutants, G3 is worse than G1. So the presence of G3 is necessary for G1 to function. So if G3 is not present, G1's function doesn't help. That would fit a situation where G3 is epistatic to G1.

But how does that affect the double mutant g1g3? If G3 is epistatic, then g3 is 50%, and g1g3 would be as bad as g3, which is 50%. But the data says 10%, which is worse. So that contradicts.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both. So in any case where G2 is knocked out, the other genes' states don't matter. Which is what we see: g1g2 and g2g3 are 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But the options don't directly mention that. Looking at the options again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's correct since in g1g2, the resistance is 0% like g2, meaning G2 is epistatic.

But what about G3? Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1, and G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but in this context, we're looking at how the genes interact in the same pathway.

Wait, what's the definition of pleiotropy? It's when a single gene affects multiple phenotypic traits. But in this question, the traits are all related to anthracnose resistance. So perhaps that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 and G3 are involved in multiple pathways, but I don't think that's relevant.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Also, G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but according to our analysis, G1 and G3 are redundant, but we don't see an epistatic relationship between them. Their double mutant is worse than either, which suggests additive, not epistatic.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to choose the best fit.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G2 epistatic towards G1. That's correct. But what about G3 and G2? The same applies, but the option doesn't mention G3.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, and G1 epistatic to G3. So perhaps the redundancy is correct, but the epistatic part is not. But without a better option, perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, let me think again. Since G2 is a TF, it's acting upstream. So the other genes (G1 and G3) are downstream. 

In the double mutants involving G1 and G3, their interaction shows that without both, the resistance is much worse. So G1 and G3 are likely in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. So when both are out, the total resistance is the sum of their individual contributions. If G1 contributes x and G3 contributes y, then together, they contribute x+y. So in that case, their double mutant would be more severe than either single.

That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways—gene redundancy. So their functions are redundant, and each contributes to resistance. So when both are out, you lose both contributions, leading to lower resistance.

So, the correct answer should mention that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Looking at the options:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. So if they are redundant, why would G1 be epistatic to G3? Maybe that part is incorrect, but perhaps the option is the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Because the single mutant g3 is worse than g1, but the double mutant is even worse.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible relationships.

If G2 is the TF, it's upstream. So in the presence of G2, G1 and G3 can function. But without G2, neither can function.

Now, in the single mutants:

- g1: 75% resistance. So they still have some resistance, possibly from G3.
- g3: 50% resistance. So some resistance from G1?
Wait, but that would suggest that G3 is more important than G1, but when both are out, resistance is very low.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. G2 activates both. So without G2, neither can function, so resistance is zero. But with G2 present, if one is out, the other can compensate.

So in g1, since G3 is present, it can contribute 50% resistance. Wait, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, conflicting. Because if G3 contributes 50%, then in g1, you have only G3, so 50% resistance. But the data says g1 is 75% resistance.

Wait, that's confusing. So perhaps when G1 is missing, but G3 is present, you get 75% resistance. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe G1 contributes more than G3. Or perhaps G2 is needed for both, but each has a different function.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. So, G2 activates both. So in g1, you have G3 function, which is 50% resistance. But according to the data, g1 is 75% resistance, which is higher than G3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to look at the options again.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can do the same job. So the presence of G1 can compensate for the absence of G3, and vice versa.

In the double mutant g1g3, you have 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So that's consistent with redundancy.

As for epistasis between G1 and G3, in this case, the double mutant is worse than either, which suggests that their functions are additive. So they function in parallel, which is redundancy.

So, in this case, perhaps neither is epistatic to the other. But the options don't have an option that says that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the effect is more like G1's absence. But according to the data, the double mutant is worse than either, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the fact that G2 is upstream and epistatic to both is the key part of the conclusion.

Looking at the options again, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, which is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Also, G1 and G3 are redundant.

Looking at the options, which one aligns with this? Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But since G1 is epistatic, that would imply that in the double mutant, you only see G1's effect. But the data says it's worse than either. So perhaps the option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that G2 is a TF, and the others are downstream. G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their double mutant is worse, so they're redundant.

Among the options, option D says gene redundancy. So that's right. But the epistasis part in option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure, but perhaps that's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is correct. Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. Since in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But what about G3? The option doesn't mention G3's epistasis.

So the correct conclusion must be that G2 is a transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Also, G1 and G3 are redundant.

Looking back, the only option that has G2 as TF is option D and A. Option A says G1 is TF, which is incorrect.

So option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that would require G1 to be epistatic to G2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to structure the possible relationships.

G2 is a TF:

- Without G2, no resistance (g2: 0%).
- So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in any double mutant with G2 knocked out, the resistance is 0%.

Now, G1 and G3:

- G1: 75% → 25% loss.
- G3: 50% → 50% loss.
- G1G3: 10% → 90% loss.

So when both are out, the loss is more than additive (75 + 50 = 125, but the actual is 90). So perhaps they function in separate pathways.

But if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, their effects would be additive. So the double mutant would have 75 +50 -100 = 25% (if each contributes 25% and 50%). But in reality, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than additive. So perhaps they have an overlapping function or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G1 and G3 increases the expression of another gene, but without both, that gene is not expressed enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both regulated by G2, and each contributes to resistance. So when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are active. When G2 is absent, they can't function. But when only G1 is absent, G3 can still contribute (g1: 75% → perhaps G3 contributes 75%?), but that doesn't fit with earlier data.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1 and G3. G1 contributes 25% (so without G1, 75% remains), and G3 contributes 50% (so without G3, 50% remains).

But if that's the case, then the double mutant would have 75% -25% (G1) + 50% -50% (G3) = 50%? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe each contributes to the same pathway. So G1 and G3 are both part of the same pathway. So when G1 is out, you lose 25% of resistance, when G3 is out, 50% is lost, and when both are out, 90% is lost. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. So G1's pathway contributes 25% resistance, and G3's contributes 50%. So without G1, you lose 25%, so 75% remains. Without G3, you lose 50%, so 50% remains. Without both, you lose 25 +50 =75 → 25% remains. But the data says 10%, which is 90% loss. So that doesn't fit.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to think in terms of epistasis.

Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in gene A masks the effect of gene B.

In our case, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, regardless of G1 or G3. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Now, between G1 and G3: the double mutant is worse than either. So their effects are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, perhaps acting redundantly.

So the conclusion must be that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, and G2 is epistatic to both. Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the part about G1 being epistatic towards G3 doesn't fit, because the double mutant is worse than either. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, despite that minor discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but that doesn't mention G3's epistasis.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So, in the case of redundancy, when both are knocked out, the effect is the sum (or worse) than either. So in this case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so that fits. As for the epistatic part, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 'gene redundancy' in option D refers to both being activated by G2, but each can compensate for the other. So, if G1 is out, G3 can compensate, but if both are out, you lose all their contributions. So in that case, their double mutant would be worse than either.

But then, in terms of epistasis, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that means G1's pathway is upstream. So in the absence of G1, G3's function doesn't matter. But the data says that without G1, you have 75% resistance, which is better than without G3. So that doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor. So that's correct. G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits with the g1g3 double mutant. And G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure about that last part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking back, the question asks which conclusion can be drawn. The options may not perfectly fit, but we have to choose the best one.

So, the correct conclusion should be that G2 is a transcription factor, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 are in a redundant pathway.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. The first two parts are correct, but the third might not be.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to pick the best possible.

Wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor. We've concluded it's G2.

So, looking at the options, which ones have G2 as TF? Options A, C, D.

Option A: G1 is TF → no.

Option C: G2 is TF → yes.

Option D: G2 is TF → yes.

So the correct answer must be between C and D.

Option C says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But pleiotropy isn't the case here. They all affect the same trait, anthracnose resistance. So perhaps the correct option is D, which refers to redundancy.

So I think the correct answer is option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants and their roles in resistance to anthracnose. The resistance levels of single mutants and double mutants provide insights into their genetic relationships. The key findings and conclusions are as follows:

1. **G2 is a transcription factor**:  
   - The single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance. This suggests G2 acts upstream, likely as a transcription factor activating downstream genes (G1 and/or G3).

2. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**:  
   - In the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0%, the same as g2. This indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2's function is upstream and masks the effects of G1 and G3 when absent.

3. **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**:  
   - The single mutants g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance) show partial loss of resistance. However, the double mutant g1g3 has only 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through parallel or redundant pathways. When both are knocked out, the combined loss of their contributions leads to a significant reduction in resistance.

4. **G1 is epistatic towards G3**:  
   - While the data primarily supports redundancy between G1 and G3, the option specifies that G1 is epistatic towards G3. This could imply that G1's pathway is upstream or more critical in certain contexts, though the double mutant data (10% resistance) suggests additive effects rather than strict epistasis.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states G1 is a transcription factor, which contradicts the data showing G2 is the critical upstream gene (g2 has 0% resistance).  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It suggests G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which is not supported by the data. Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 does not align with the double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While it correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor, it claims G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which is not evident in the data. Pleiotropy would involve multiple traits, but all effects here are related to anthracnose resistance.  
- **Option D**: Correct. It accurately identifies G2 as a transcription factor, G1 and G3 as redundant, and specifies that G1 is epistatic towards G3. While the epistatic relationship between G1 and G3 is not fully clear from the data, this option best fits the experimental results.

### Conclusion:
The experimental data supports the conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This aligns most closely with **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
