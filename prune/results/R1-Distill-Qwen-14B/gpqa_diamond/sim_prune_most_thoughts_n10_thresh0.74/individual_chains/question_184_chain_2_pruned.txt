Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still pretty new to all this. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to go through each option and see which sequence of reactions gives the desired product.

First, I'll try to break down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. So numbering the ring, let's see: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure: the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So looking at the benzene ring, they're all ortho to each other. Like, the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement, but wait, no, 1,2,3 are adjacentâ€”wait, no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with substituents at each adjacent position.

Wait, no, that's a 1,2,3- arrangement, meaning all three substituents are adjacent? Or perhaps in a way that they are each next to each other. So the substituents are meta? No, because in a benzene ring, 1,2,3 would all be adjacent in a row, which isn't possible due to the ring's structure. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring; substituents at positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent in a line, but that's not possible because each position is next to two others. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So if you have substituents at 1, 2, and 3, that's three adjacent carbons in a row, but benzene isn't a straight chain. So perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way where each is adjacent to two others, forming a meta arrangement? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just move on.

The main idea is that I have three substituents on benzene: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. I need to plan the order of reactions to introduce them. The key here is the directing effects of each group because the order in which substituents are added can influence where the next groups attach.

Benzene is the starting material, so the first substituent will determine the ring's orientation for the next groups.

Let's list the substituents and their directing effects:

- tert-butyl: it's a bulky group. Since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director.
- ethoxy: an ether group. It's activating (since it's an electron-donating group, via O's lone pairs through resonance), so it's an ortho/para director.
- nitro: a strong deactivating, meta director. Because nitro groups are electron-withdrawing.

Hmm. So, when introducing groups, the first group will direct the next substitution. Let's think about the order in which these groups are added.

But wait, considering steric hindrance and reaction feasibility: tert-butyl is bulky, so if it's added early, it might influence where subsequent substituents go. But nitro is a meta director, which would require the substituents to be in specific positions.

Wait, the target molecule has three substituents. Let's imagine how they might be added. Let's plan the order.

One approach is to add the groups in an order that makes the synthesis easier, perhaps adding the most difficult group first or considering the activating/deactivating nature.

Let me think about which substituents are meta or para directors.

Wait, maybe the nitro group should be introduced early because it's a strong deactivating group. If we add the nitro group last, the ring might be less activated, making it harder to add the group. Alternatively, if we add it first, perhaps the other substituents can be added in positions directed by it.

But wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So if we first introduce nitro, the next substituents would go into the meta positions relative to nitro. But wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, which are all adjacent. So perhaps the nitro group is at position 3, and the ethoxy and tert-butyl are at 1 and 2, which are adjacent to each other and to the nitro.

Wait, but the nitro group is a meta director. So if it's already on the ring, the next substituents would go into positions meta to it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added first, then the tert-butyl, and then the nitro group. Let me think.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so adding it first would activate the ring and direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Then adding a tert-butyl group would be next. The tert-butyl, being an alkyl group, is also activating and ortho/para directing. Then the nitro group, which is de
