Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think about what I know.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 mL, right? It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects anything here.

The molecular weights are given: KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol, and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol. Oh, wait, the Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O means it's the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two water molecules attached, right? So when it dissolves, those waters come off, I guess.

The Ka values for H₃PO₄ are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. I remember that these K values correspond to the dissociation steps of phosphoric acid. Let me jot that down.

H₃PO₄ is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation (Ka1) is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4⁻. The second (Ka2) is H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H+ + HPO4²⁻. The third (Ka3) is HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4³⁻. So we're looking for [PO4³⁻] in the solution.

Now, the solution contains two different salts: KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Let's think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K⁺ and H2PO4⁻ ions. So each mole of KH₂PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4⁻.

Na₂HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it should lose the waters of hydration and dissociate into 2 Na⁺ and HPO4²⁻ ions. So each mole of Na₂HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4²-.

So the solution has both H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ ions. Hmm, interesting. So these are two different species that can interact in the solution.

I remember that in such cases, the solution is probably a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, H2PO4⁻ is the conjugate base of H3PO4, and the acid form would be H3PO4. But wait, H2PO4⁻ can also act as an acid because it can donate another proton to become HPO4²⁻.

Wait, in this solution, we have H2PO4⁻ (from KH₂PO4) and HPO4²⁻ (from Na₂HPO4). So perhaps HPO4²⁻ is the conjugate base of H2PO4⁻. Because H2PO4⁻ can donate a proton to become HPO4²⁻, so HPO4²⁻ is the conjugate base of H2PO4⁻. So the solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻.

The buffer solution would have a pH determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4 because H2PO4⁻ is in equilibrium with HPO4²⁻. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, in a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is the conjugate base and HA is the weak acid.

In this case, HA is H2PO4⁻ and A- is HPO4²⁻. So the equation becomes pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]).

But wait, I don't know the pH yet. But the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4³⁻. Hmm, how does that tie in?

Oh, because HPO4²⁻ can further deprotonate to form PO4³⁻. So in the solution, HPO4²⁻ is in equilibrium with H+ and PO4³⁻. The Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, which is the third ionization constant.

So, the concentration of PO4³⁻ will depend on the [HPO4²⁻] and the pH of the solution. Because, according to the third dissociation:

HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+].

But wait, [H+] is determined by the buffer solution from the first two species. So I can find [H+] using the buffer equation, and then use that to find [PO4³⁻].

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of KH₂PO4 and moles of Na₂HPO4·2H2O.

2. Find concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ in the solution.

3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.

4. With pH known, calculate [H+].

5. Use the Ka3 expression to find [PO4³⁻], because [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+].

Let me start with step 1.

Moles of KH₂PO4: mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007336 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na₂HPO4·2H2O: mass 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005605 mol.

Now, since the solution is 200 mL (0.2 L), concentrations are:

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028025 M.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Because KH₂PO4 gives H2PO4⁻, and Na₂HPO4 gives HPO4²⁻.

So the concentrations are:

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.028025 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = 7.208? Wait, wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Let me calculate that. Let's see, log(6.2) is approximately 0.7924, so 6.2e-8 is 10^(-7.208). So pKa2 is 7.208.

Now, the ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] is 0.028025 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.7648.

So log(0.7648) is log(7.648e-1). Hmm, log(0.7648) is approximately -0.113.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.113) = 7.095.

So the pH is around 7.095.

Now, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

Now, moving on to the PO4³⁻ concentration.

HPO4²⁻ is in equilibrium with PO4³⁻ and H+.

The expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻].

We can rearrange this to [PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+].

Plugging in the values:

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4²⁻] is 0.028025 M.

[H+] is 7.94e-8 M.

So [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / 7.94e-8.

Let me calculate numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 ≈ 5.0445e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So [PO4³⁻] ≈ 5.0445e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.35e-7 M.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check all steps for possible errors.

First, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007336 mol. Right.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005605 mol. Correct.

Concentrations in 0.2 L (200 mL):

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M. Correct.

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.005605 / 0.2 = 0.028025 M. Correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]).

pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.208.

Ratio is 0.028025 / 0.03668 = 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) ≈ -0.113.

pH = 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095. Correct.

[H+] = 10^-7.095 ≈ 7.94e-8. Correct.

Now, [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (7.94e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = let's see.

1.8 * 0.028025 = approximately 0.050445.

So 0.050445e-12 = 5.0445e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So 5.0445e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.0445 / 7.94) * 1e-6.

5.0445 /7.94 ≈ 0.635.

So 0.635e-6 = 6.35e-7 M.

Wait, the options are A)6.24e-7, D)3.97e-7, etc.

Hmm, but my calculation gives about 6.35e-7, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7) but not exactly matching. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the log and pH calculations.

Let me compute pKa2 more accurately.

Ka2 =6.2e-8 → pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8).

Log(6.2) is log(6) is 0.7782, log(6.2) is approximately 0.7924.

So log(6.2e-8) = 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076 → pKa2=7.2076.

Now, the ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] is 0.028025 / 0.03668 = let's compute that accurately.

0.028025 ÷ 0.03668 = let's compute 28025 / 36680.

Wait, 28025 ÷ 36680 ≈ 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) = log(7.648 * 10^-1) = log(7.648) + (-1) * log(10) → log(7.648) ≈ 0.8845 → 0.8845 -1 = -0.1155.

So pH=7.2076 + (-0.1155) =7.0921.

So pH is approximately 7.0921. So [H+]=10^(-7.0921) = 8.17e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I had 7.94e-8, but more accurately, it's 8.17e-8.

So, recalculating [PO4³⁻]:

(1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.17e-8) = (5.0445e-14) / (8.17e-8) = 5.0445 /8.17 * 1e-6.

5.0445 /8.17 ≈ 0.617 → 0.617e-6 = 6.17e-7 M.

Hmm, so now it's 6.17e-7. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

But perhaps I should calculate more precisely.

Let me compute the exact ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] = (0.005605 / 0.2) / (0.007336 / 0.2) ) → (0.005605 / 0.007336) = 0.7647.

So log(0.7647) is more precisely about -0.1135. So pH=7.2076 -0.1135=7.0941.

[H+]=10^(-7.0941)= 8.12e-8.

Now, [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.12e-8) = (5.0445e-14) / 8.12e-8 = (5.0445 /8.12) * 1e-6.

5.0445 divided by 8.12 is approximately 0.621.

So 0.621e-6 M → 6.21e-7 M.

Ah! So approximately 6.21e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is pretty close, but perhaps I made some approximation. Let me check if I can get more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's concentration of HPO4²⁻ is from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but when it dissolves, the HPO4²⁻ may not all stay as HPO4²⁻ because some could convert to PO4³⁻, but wait, in solution, it's a matter of equilibrium. Wait no, the amount I calculated as moles is the initial, but since it's a solution, the HPO4²⁻ will be in equilibrium with some PO4³⁻, but in the buffer solution, the majority is HPO4²⁻.

Wait, but no, because the buffer is between H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻, and the PO4³⁻ comes from the further deprotonation of HPO4²⁻. So the amount of PO4³⁻ is negligible compared to the HPO4²⁻.

So the initial moles of HPO4²⁻ are 0.005605 mol. But some of that will dissociate into PO4³⁻, but that's probably a small amount. But when calculating [PO4³⁻], we're using the initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ and the pH.

Wait, but when I used [HPO4²⁻] as 0.028025 M in the calculation, that was the initial concentration before considering any dissociation. So actually, in the presence of H+, some HPO4²⁻ will convert to PO4³⁻. So that might affect the calculation.

Wait, but in the calculation, I used the initial [HPO4²⁻] as the concentration, but actually, it's in equilibrium with PO4³⁻. So the actual [HPO4²⁻] would be a little less than 0.028025 M because some has converted to PO4³⁻.

But wait, in the buffer equation, we used the initial concentrations to find the pH, which in turn affects the [PO4³⁻]. So perhaps the initial assumption that [HPO4²⁻] is 0.028025 M is correct because the amount that dissociates into PO4³⁻ is negligible compared to the initial amount.

Let me consider the dissociation:

HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻.

The concentration of PO4³⁻ is small compared to HPO4²⁻. So [HPO4²⁻] ≈ 0.028025 M minus [PO4³⁻], which is negligible. So I can approximate [HPO4²⁻] as 0.028025 M.

So I think the initial approach is correct.

Therefore, the concentration of PO4³⁻ is approximately 6.21e-7 M. But the options don't have that exactly. The closest is option A: 6.24e-7, which is 6.24 x10^-7 M.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that in the solution, the HPO4²⁻ can also contribute to the PO4³⁻ concentration. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact value with more precise numbers.

Wait, let me recompute the [PO4³⁻] calculation precisely.

Ka3 =1.8e-12. So,

[PO4³⁻] = (Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4²⁻] = 0.028025 M.

[H+] =8.12e-8 M.

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.028025) = (1.8 * 0.028025) * 1e-12 = 0.050445e-12 =5.0445e-14.

Divided by [H+] =8.12e-8:

5.0445e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0445 /8.12) * 1e-6 → 5.0445 /8.12 ≈ 0.621 → 0.621e-6 →6.21e-7 M.

Hmm, so 6.21e-7 M. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation.

Ratio [HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻] =0.028025 /0.03668 = approximately 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) → Let me compute that accurately. Log(0.7648) ≈ let's see.

Log(0.7) = -0.1549, log(0.76) is about -0.1179, log(0.7648) → perhaps around -0.113.

Wait, let me compute using exact values.

Alternatively, using logarithm tables or calculator approximations:

ln(0.7648) ≈ -0.2685 → log(0.7648) = ln(0.7648)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.2685)/2.3026 ≈ -0.1166.

So pH =7.2076 -0.1166=7.091.

So [H+]=10^(-7.091)= about 8.12e-8 M.

So [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) /8.12e-8.

1.8e-12 *0.028025 =5.0445e-14.

Divide by 8.12e-8: 5.0445e-14 /8.12e-8= (5.0445/8.12)*1e-6.

5.0445 /8.12 ≈0.621 →6.21e-7 M.

So the answer should be approximately 6.21e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7).

But wait, another point: when I calculated the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O, I used 1.00g /177.99 g/mol. Let me recalculate that.

177.99 g/mol is the Mw. 1.00 g /177.99 = approximately 0.005605 mol. Correct.

But wait, let me compute exactly: 177.99 is 177.99. 1 /177.99 = approx 0.005605.

Yes.

Wait, another thing: the solution's total volume is 200 mL (0.2 L). So the concentrations of the ions are based on 0.2 L.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4⁻, and the base is HPO4²⁻. So it's pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]).

Which is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the moles should be considered as the concentrations in the solution. Since both salts are dissolved in the same volume, the concentrations are moles divided by volume.

So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: could the solution involve considering the common ion effect or any other factor?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the PO4³⁻ comes from both the HPO4²⁻ and any further dissociation of the H2PO4⁻. But I don't think H2PO4⁻ dissociates to form PO4³⁻ directly. It would go through HPO4²⁻ first.

So, H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H+ + HPO4²⁻ (Ka2), and HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H+ + PO4³⁻ (Ka3). So the PO4³⁻ comes only from the second dissociation.

Therefore, the approach I took is correct.

So, the concentration of PO4³⁻ is approximately 6.21e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7). But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: 6.24e-7.

Option D: 3.97e-7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles or in the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol≈0.005605 mol. Correct.

Concentrations:

[H2PO4⁻] = 0.007336 / 0.2 =0.03668 M.

[HPO4²⁻] =0.005605 /0.2=0.028025 M.

Yes, correct.

pKa2=7.2076.

Ratio=0.7648.

Log= -0.1135.

pH=7.2076 -0.1135=7.0941.

[H+]=10^-7.0941=8.12e-8.

So [PO4³⁻] = (1.8e-12 *0.028025) /8.12e-8=6.21e-7.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B) 5.48x10^-7 M 

C) 2.81x10^-7 M

D) 3.97x10^-7 M 

So option A is the only one close to 6.2e-7. But wait, the calculation I did gave 6.21e-7. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So that's the right choice.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Let's see.

Wait, maybe the formula is [PO4³⁻] = [HPO4²⁻] * (Ka3 / [H+]).

Which is what I did.

Wait, another point: when calculating [H+], perhaps I should use more precise pKa values or consider activity coefficients, but I think in this problem, such considerations are beyond the scope. So the approach is correct.

So, after all this, the answer should be option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[ [\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-] = \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \].

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Weight}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005605 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration in 200 mL (\(0.2 \, \text{L}\)):  
  \[ [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}] = \frac{0.005605}{0.2} \approx 0.028025 \, \text{M} \].

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The solution is a buffer involving \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base), with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} \right).
\]
- \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208 \).  
- Ratio:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.028025}{0.03668} \approx 0.7648.
  \]
- \( \log(0.7648) \approx -0.113 \).  
- Substituting into the equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate [H⁺] from pH
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Use the dissociation of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) to find [PO₄³⁻]
The dissociation of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) is governed by \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \):  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028025)}{7.94 \times 10^{-8}} \approx \frac{5.0445 \times 10^{-14}}{7.94 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.35 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.35 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

ANSWER: A
