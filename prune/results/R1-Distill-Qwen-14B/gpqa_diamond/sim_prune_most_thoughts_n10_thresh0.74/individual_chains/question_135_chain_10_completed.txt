Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions, and determining the allowed decay products of X based on the given Lagrangian. 

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term should be something like λ times the fermion fields and X. I think the correct form is -λ f times ψ_f bar times X times ψ_f. So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ_f bar ψ_f. That probably means X is a scalar field because the fermion fields are in a Dirac structure.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to figure out what fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

At lowest order, that would be tree-level processes, so X can couple directly to fermions. The decay would be X → f f-bar. So the possible decay channels are into any fermion-antifermion pair where the sum of the fermion masses is less than the mass of X.

Wait, but for each fermion f, the maximum allowed decay would be when the mass of f is less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2, because each fermion would carry half the energy (since they're produced at rest in the center of mass frame, roughly). But wait, actually, in reality, the mass of the fermion must be less than or equal to X's mass divided by 2. Because each fermion would have energy E, and their rest mass is m. The condition is that the total energy given to each is at least m. So for production, 2m ≤ M_X. So m ≤ M_X/2.

So M_X is 6 GeV. So for any fermion f, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

What's the mass of each known fermion? Let me think.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Their masses (current algebra masses, not including QCD effects perhaps, but in reality, the masses are as follows):

u ≈ 2 MeV
d ≈ 5 MeV
s ≈ 100 MeV
c ≈ 1.5 GeV (but sometimes approximated as ~1.3 GeV?)
b ≈ 4.5 GeV
t ≈ 173 GeV

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact masses. Alternatively, perhaps I should rely on the standard model where the top is too heavy, so X can't decay into top quarks because 3 GeV is way less than 173 GeV.

Similarly, the charged leptons: e, mu, tau. Their masses are about:
e: ~0.5 MeV
mu: ~105 MeV
tau: ~1.78 GeV

So, the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so M_X is 6 GeV. So 3 GeV is the maximum m_f for each fermion.

So any fermion with m_f <= 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Let's check each fermion:

Electron (e): way below 3 GeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Muon (mu): 105 MeV, so yes.

Tau: about 1.78 GeV, so yes, since 1.78 < 3.

Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV, so yes.

Bottom quark: about 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So m_b is 4.5 GeV, which is bigger than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 2 * 4.5 GeV =9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks.

What about the top quark? 173 GeV, way too big, so no.

What about the other quarks: u, d, s.

u: 2 MeV, way below. So yes.

d: 5 MeV, yes.

s: 100 MeV, yes.

c: 1.5 GeV, yes.

So possible fermions for decay are:

u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but can X decay into these quarks? Because in the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling for up-type quarks is proportional to their mass, but for down-type, same. But I think the problem is more about whether the fermion is light enough, not about whether the coupling exists.

Wait, the problem statement gives the interaction Lagrangian as involving ψ_f. So the interaction term is X ψ_f bar ψ_f. So X must have a coupling to each fermion f. But whether that's allowed depends on the model. But the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the fermions, so I should assume that X can couple to any fermion, provided the mass allows it.

So the possible decay products are any f f-bar where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So the possible pairs are:

e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-,

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar.

But not b or t.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, etc. But since b is 4.5 GeV, X can't decay into b's. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. All these fermions have m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So this seems correct. But wait, does B include c? Yes, because c is 1.5 GeV. So B is possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t. Oh no, t is too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) X(y) \psi_f(y)\) indicates that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \), provided the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( m_f \leq M_X / 2 \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This gives a maximum allowed fermion mass of \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The known fermion masses are as follows:
- \( u \): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( d \): \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( s \): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). Therefore, \( X \) can decay into the following pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \)
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( u \bar{u} \)
- \( d \bar{d} \)
- \( s \bar{s} \)
- \( c \bar{c} \)

The fermions \( b \) and \( t \) are too heavy (\( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)) and cannot be decay products of \( X \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
