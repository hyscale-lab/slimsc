Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame? And we're to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so it's just a straightforward kinematics problem.

Wait, so the key here is to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame. Since both are inertial frames, I'm thinking that this might involve relative velocity and perhaps time dilation or something from special relativity, but wait, the problem doesn't mention acceleration or anything relativistic beyond the fact that both frames are inertial. Hmm, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light. So relativistic effects might be non-negligible here, but I'm not sure if the problem expects us to use special relativity or just Newtonian mechanics. Let me think about the wording again. The problem says both are inertial, so it's definitely in the realm of special relativity because Newtonian mechanics would consider frames inertial as moving at constant velocity, but without considering time dilation.

But wait, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, their own time is 50 seconds, but what about the Galaxy's frame? Because of time dilation, the time intervals would differ. Oh wait, but which frame is moving relative to which? Let me clarify the motion.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards it at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. Conversely, from the ejecta's frame, the
