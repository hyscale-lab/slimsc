Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and start breaking it down.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no, wait. Oh right! When an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to perform a hydrolysis reaction, typically converting the alkyne into a ketone or an acid, depending on the setup. Wait, no, wait again. Or is that for nitriles? Hmm. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of alkyl chlorides, maybe? Or wait, no, another thought: I think the reaction of an alkyne with HI and red phosphorus is called the oxymercuration or something? Wait, no, that's for alkynes. Oh wait, maybe that's for alkenes. Let me think. Oh wait, no, the reaction of an alkyne with HI and red phosphorus usually leads to the formation of a diiodide. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait, another angle: the reaction of an alkyne with HI and red phosphorus in what's called a hydroiodic acid (HI) and red phosphorus. Oh right, that's the method to make vicinal dihalides. Wait no, because when you have an alkyne reacting with HI, it can lead to dihalides. But wait, if it's a terminal alkyne, maybe it adds HI across the triple bond, making a diiodide. Then, when you add red phosphorus, which is a reducing agent, perhaps it reduces the diiodide?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Oh wait, another thought: the reaction of an alkyne with red phosphorus and HI is the oxymercuration method, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. For example, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H3O+ and H2O, but with red phosphorus, maybe it's a different pathway. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI—maybe it's used for the dehydration of alcohols? No, that's sulfuric acid. Alternatively, I think of the reaction where an alkyne is treated with phosphorus and HI, which is called the hydroiodic acid addition. For a terminal alkyne, this would give a vicinal diiodide. But then what happens when that's heated or treated further? Or perhaps the diiodide would undergo elimination?

Alternatively, wait, when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might not react. Hmm. Maybe I should look at the spectral data first to figure out what Compound X is, and then see what reaction it undergoes.

So let's analyze the IR and NMR data to find out what Compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely due to O-H or N-H stretching. But there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions suggest possible aromatic rings (C=C stretching). So putting that together, we have a compound that has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester or acid), and possibly an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad usually suggests exchange with a proton, like an O-H (maybe from a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde). But 10.5 is more in line with a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but the aldehyde is typically around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet. But wait, the integration is 1H. For a carboxylic acid, that would fit.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents. The doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because if it's para, the two protons are equivalent and couple with each other, giving a doublet each. So 8.0 ppm downfield suggests substituents that are electron-withdrawing, like a carbonyl group. For example, a para-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups on either side.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. This could be a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom or part of a carbonyl group. Maybe a ketone or something like that.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, which could be part of a CH2 group next to something like a carbonyl, perhaps in a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H, which suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH3) group or something similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, perhaps at the end of a chain. Like a CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this
