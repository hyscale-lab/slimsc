Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify X from the options A to D.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I remember that it's often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe like an elimination or a ring-opening. Oh wait, wait. Alternatively, it's a strong, non-nucleophilic base and is used in the formation of epoxides from other compounds. Or perhaps in epoxide ring-opening reactions?

Hmm, but wait, the product's NMR is given, so maybe I should look at the product first. The question is about identifying compound X, which was reacted to form the given product. So, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation, where the double bond in X is converted into an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide, and the reaction is something else. Let me think about the options. The options are all some kind of oxirane (epoxides), right? Let me check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an epoxide with a styryl group (like a benzene ring connected by a double bond) at position 2, and the substituent is at the 4-position of the styryl group—so the methyl is on the benzene ring para to the double bond.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent on the epoxide is a prop-1-en-2-yl group attached to a phenyl. So the structure is like a vinyl group attached to a benzene, with the substituent on the epoxide at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. Wait, but oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and an oxygen. So positions 2 and 3 would be adjacent in the epoxide ring.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So that's an epoxide where the substituent is a styryl group at position 2. Styryl is a benzene ring attached via a double bond.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is between X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base. If X is an epoxide and the reaction is ring-opening, then the product would have something else. But the product's NMR is given, which includes an epoxide peak? Let me look at the 13C NMR. Oh wait, in the product's 13C NMR, there's a peak at δ 197.7. That seems high, maybe a carbonyl group. Wait, no, unless it's an ester or ketone or possibly an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually in the 60s or 70s. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation. So X is a diene or an alkene, and the reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, no, because the product is already an epoxide. Oh wait, no, the product's NMR shows the epoxide. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but let's look at the NMR data of the product. The 1H NMR has signals at 2.28 and 2.31, both singlets, each integrating for 3H. So that suggests two methyl groups. Then we have aromatic protons in the 6.75 to 7.71 regions.

In the 13C NMR, the carbons are at 21.3 (s) and 28.4 (s), which would be the two methyl groups. Then the aromatic carbons are in the 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C). And then the 197.7 is probably a carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Wait, but in the product, maybe that's the epoxide oxygen's neighboring carbons. Wait, no, usually epoxide carbons are around 60-70 ppm. But 19
