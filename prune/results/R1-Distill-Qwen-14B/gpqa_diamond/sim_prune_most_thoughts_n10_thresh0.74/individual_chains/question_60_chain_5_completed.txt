Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who have built a super-fast spacecraft. They want to travel to Earth, and their astronaut is 22 years old. The spacecraft is moving at a constant speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super close to c. The average lifetime of these aliens is around 150 solar years. So, the question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's point of view, and will they make it?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such high speeds, relativistic effects come into play. Specifically, time dilation and length contraction. Since the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of c, the effects won't be negligible.

First, I think about the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. I recall that the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, so the distance is approximately 160,000 light-years. But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, the distance would be contracted because of their high speed. So the length contraction formula comes into play here.

The length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (the distance as measured in the stationary frame, like Earth's frame), and v is the velocity of the spacecraft.

But wait, actually, in the astronaut's frame (the spacecraft's frame), the Earth and the LMC are moving at 0.99999987*c. So the distance between them would be contracted. So the astronaut would perceive the distance as shorter than the actual 160,000 light-years.

Let me compute that. So v is 0.99999987*c, which is very close to c. Let me compute beta (β) as v/c, so β = 0.99999987. Then, beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 0.00000013)^2. Using the binomial approximation, (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x for small x. So 1 - 2*(0.00000013) = 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974. Wait, but even more accurately, perhaps I should calculate it.

Alternatively, since v is so close to c, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So beta squared is (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. The squared term is negligible, so approximately 0.99999974. So sqrt(1 - beta squared) would be sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that.

Wait, 2.6e-7 is 0.00000026. The square root of 0.00000026 is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is approximately 3.16e-4. Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(1 - beta²) ≈ 5.09e-4.

Wait, but wait, that's sqrt(1 - beta²) which is gamma's inverse. Oh, right, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So gamma is 1 / 5.09e-4 ≈ 1964. So gamma is about 1964. That's a big gamma factor here. So time dilation is significant.

But wait, the question is about the time experienced by the astronaut. So in their frame, the distance is contracted, so the time taken would be the contracted distance divided by speed.

So the proper distance L0 is 160,000 light-years. The contracted distance L would be L0 * sqrt(1 - beta²) ≈ 160,000 * 5.09e-4. Let's compute that.

160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 160,000 * 0.000509. Let me calculate that:

160,000 * 0.0005 is 80. 160,000 * 0.000009 is 1.44. So 80 + 1.44 = 81.44. So L ≈ 81.44 light-years.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5.09e-4 is 0.000509. So 160,000 * 0.000509 = 160,000 * 5.09e-4. Let me compute 160,000 * 5.09e-4.

160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 160,000 * (5.09 / 10000) ) = (160,000 / 10,000) ) *5.09 = 16 *5.09 = 81.44 light-years.

Wait, so the contracted distance is about 81.44 light-years. So the time taken for the trip, as per the astronaut's frame, would be distance divided by speed. The speed is 0.99999987c, which is approximately c for all practical purposes. So at speed v, the time t is L / v.

So L is 81.44 light-years, and v is 0.99999987c. So t ≈ (81.44 ly) / (0.99999987c) ) = 81.44 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 81.44 years. Because 0.99999987 is almost 1, so the division by that is roughly the same as multiplying by 1. So t ≈ 81.44 years.

Wait, but wait a second, is that correct? Because the astronaut's frame experiences the trip's duration as the contracted distance divided by their speed. So yes, that's right.

So the astronaut is 22 years old, and the trip takes about 81 years from their perspective. Adding 81 to 22 would make their age 103 when they arrive. But their average lifetime is 150 years. So they would live long enough to reach Earth. Therefore, the answer shouldn't be option A.

Wait, but let me recheck. Is the contracted distance from the astronaut's perspective 81.44 light-years? And since they're moving at 0.99999987c, the time taken is approximately 81.44 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.44 years, as they're almost at c.

So the astronaut would be about 22 + 81.44 = 103.44 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, they would live that long, so option A is incorrect.

Looking at the options, option D is 77 years, option C is 81, option B is 72. So it's closest to 81.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Proper distance: 160,000 light-years.

Length contraction factor: sqrt(1 - beta^2) ≈ 5.09e-4.

So L = 160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 160,000 * 0.000509 = 81.44 light-years.

Time = L / v = 81.44 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 81.44 / 1 (since 0.99999987 ≈ 1) ≈ 81.44 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 81 years, making option C the answer (81 years). But wait, option D is 77. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let me compute it more accurately.

Given beta = 0.99999987, so beta squared is (0.99999987)^2.

Compute that as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14, which is approximately 0.99999974.

Then, 1 - beta^2 is 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, because 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4, as before.

So L = 160,000 * 5.09e-4 = 81.44 light-years.

Time = 81.44 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.44 / 1 = 81.44 years.

So the closest option is option C: 81 years.

But wait, I'm thinking maybe the distance is measured in the Earth's frame, but the time experienced by the astronaut uses their own frame's calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the time from Earth's frame and then apply time dilation.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that.

In Earth's frame, the distance is 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c.

So the time taken in Earth's frame is t_earth = distance / v = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 0.0208 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So t_earth ≈ 160,000 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, their own time is t_astro = t_earth * sqrt(1 - beta^2) ≈ 160,000 * 5.09e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.000509 ≈ 81.44 years.

Same result as before.

So the astronaut ages about 81 years. So their age upon arrival is 22 + 81 = 103 years, which is less than their average lifespan of 150, so they would survive. So option A is not correct.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 81 years.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B)72

C)81

D)77

So the correct answer is option C:81 years.

Wait, but wait, another thought: 0.99999987 is extremely close to c. So perhaps the calculation of gamma is a bit different.

Wait, if v is 0.99999987c, then v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - (approx 1 - 2*1.3e-7) ) = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.09e-4, as before.

So the calculations hold.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 81 years, so the correct option is C.

Wait, but the options don't have 81.44; the closest is 81, which is option C.

So the answer should be C.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, relativistic effects must be considered due to the spacecraft's velocity of \( v = 0.99999987c \). The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( L_0 = 160,000 \) light-years in Earth's frame. From the astronaut's frame, this distance is contracted due to length contraction, which is given by:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

The velocity \( v \) is \( 0.99999987c \), so \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \). Calculating \( \beta^2 \), we get:

\[
\beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.99999974} = \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.09 \times 10^{-4}
\]

The contracted distance is:

\[
L = 160,000 \times 5.09 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.44 \, \text{light-years}
\]

The time experienced by the astronaut is the contracted distance divided by the spacecraft's speed:

\[
t = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.44 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.44 \, \text{years}
\]

Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they would be approximately \( 22 + 81.44 = 103.44 \) years old upon arrival. Given that the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, they would survive the journey. Among the options provided, the closest to \( 81.44 \, \text{years} \) is \( 81 \, \text{years} \).

**Critical Analysis of Options:**
- **A)** Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth, as their lifespan exceeds the journey time.
- **B)** Incorrect. \( 72 \, \text{years} \) is too low compared to the calculated \( 81.44 \, \text{years} \).
- **C)** Correct. \( 81 \, \text{years} \) is the closest to the calculated journey time.
- **D)** Incorrect. \( 77 \, \text{years} \) is also too low compared to the calculated \( 81.44 \, \text{years} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 81 years**.
