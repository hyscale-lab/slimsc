Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given.

Looking at the IR spectrum, there's a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 is likely an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, no, wait. Epoxides have O in the ring but maybe not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule with two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in an adamantane structure. Heating with KOH usually leads to elimination, but since it's dibromo, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but how?

Wait, if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, like in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, it could form an epoxide. Oh right! Because when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they can eliminate to form an epoxide. So product 1 is probably adamantane-1,3-diol? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Epoxide formation occurs via an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism, where two X groups (like Br) are on adjacent carbons. So when KOH is used, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons, and the elimination of Br⁻ each time. Wait, no, wait, in vicinal dihalides, the elimination would form an alkene, but perhaps in this case, the elimination forms an epoxide because of the structure of adamantane.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think. Vicinal dihalides when treated with a base can form alkenes (elimination) or epoxides (if the base is something like aqueous KOH or in
