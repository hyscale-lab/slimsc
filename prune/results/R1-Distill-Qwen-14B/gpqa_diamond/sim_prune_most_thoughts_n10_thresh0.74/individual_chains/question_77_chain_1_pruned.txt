Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the options provided.

First, let's break down the problem. There are two parts:

1. The first reaction is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene reacting with BuLi followed by H+.
2. The second reaction is a complex molecule undergoing heat-induced Cope rearrangement to form product B.

I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The compound is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. So, it's a benzene ring with a substituent: an (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group. Let me draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has a -O-(CH2)-group, and the oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. So, the structure is like OCH2Ph connected to a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me think again. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, but-2-enyl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2- but with the substituent on the first carbon of the chain.

Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2Ph. So, the starting material is a benzene ring with a OCH2 group, which is connected to a CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2 group. So, the molecule is OCH2Ph attached to a 1,5-diene? Wait, no, because the chain is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. So, the double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 3-4? Wait, no, CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2 would make the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, but that's a 1,3-diene if there's another double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the starting molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. So, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH-CH2 but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- with the substituent on the first carbon. Wait, no: the substituent is on the first carbon of the butenyl group. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2Ph? No, wait but the butenyl is four carbons, with the double bond between C2 and C3. So
