Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, respectively. But wait, I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

The question gives me a scenario where a point charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d must be r minus the position of the charge at time tr, right? Because the charge was at a different place when it emitted the field that we're observing now.

The velocity of the charge at the time tr is given as v. And we're asked about the potentials at time t, which is after tr (t > tr). So we're dealing with a retarded time situation, I think. Retarded time because the field we observe now is based on where the charge was some time ago.

Now, the potentials. I remember that the scalar potential V is usually (q)/(4πε₀ r), but wait, maybe it's modified when the charge is moving. And the vector potential A is related to the velocity somehow.

Wait, but in the case of a static charge, V is q/(4πε₀ r) and A is zero. But when the charge is moving, A might not be zero. Oh, but wait, in the static case, the magnetic field is zero, which would correspond to A being zero too. But when the charge is moving, there's a magnetic field, so A would be non-zero.

Wait, but the problem says "what are the scalar and vector potentials at time t". So potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The potentials are usually given in terms of the charge and current distributions. The scalar potential comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field.

In the case of a point charge moving with velocity v, the electric and magnetic fields are given by the Liénard's result, right? Or maybe I should think in terms of the potentials directly.

The scalar potential V is generally the same as the static case if we ignore the motion's effect, but I'm not sure. Wait no, because when the charge is moving, the scalar potential might still be V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time. But wait, the problem says the observation is at r, so how does d figure into this?

Wait, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d = r - r_tr, where r_tr is the position at time tr. So the distance from the charge to the observation point is |d|, but actually, the observation is at r, and the charge is at r_tr at time tr.

So when we consider the potentials, the scalar potential at r and time t would be due to the charge's position and velocity at tr. So the scalar potential V(r, t) would depend on the charge's position at tr, and the vector potential A(r, t) would involve its velocity v at tr.

Let me think about the expressions. I think the scalar potential V is given by (q)/(4πε₀ |d|) multiplied by some factor involving time or velocity. Alternatively, wait, maybe the scalar potential comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the general expressions for potentials due to a moving charge. The scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀) times (1/(r' - v t/c² )) or something like that, where r' is the position at the retarded time. Or maybe it's 1/(r' + ...). Hmm.

Alternatively, the potentials can be found using the retarded time approach. The scalar potential is V = q/(4πε₀) * (1/(r - (v/c²)(t - tr))) ?

Wait, no, I think that's more the form of the field. Let's get back. The scalar potential due to a charge is V = (q)/(4πε₀) * (1/|r - r_tr|), where r_tr is the charge's position at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is given by something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (some function of d and v and c). Wait, the vector potential for a moving charge is usually given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * (d)/(d·d - (v/c)^2 d·d + ... )? Hmm, not exactly. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v / (1 - (v·d)/(c |d|))² or something like that. Wait, perhaps the denominator involves (|d| c - v·d). Because that looks familiar from the options given.

Looking at the options, option C has V as (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d)) and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)). But wait, V in option C is (qc)/(denominator), but in standard potential expressions, the denominator is |r - r_tr|, which would be |d|, but here it's multiplied by c and other terms.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the potentials. The scalar potential for a moving charge at a distant point is V = q/(4πε₀ |d|) * (something involving velocity, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is simply q/(4πε₀ |d|) and the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |d|
