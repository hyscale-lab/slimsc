Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me try to understand what the question is asking.

So, the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, is that a 3x1 column vector? So it's a three-dimensional vector. Oh right, quantum states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, so this makes sense.

Then, there's an observable, P, which is represented by a matrix. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So, the matrix P looks like this:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Wait, but observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose.

Looking at P, since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So, the transpose of P should equal P. Let me see:

Original P:
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Transposing P would swap rows and columns. So the first column becomes the first row, etc. Let's see:

After transpose:
Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0 → same as original row 1.
Column 2 becomes row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 → same as original row 2.
Column 3 becomes row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0 → same as original row 3.
Wait, no. Wait, the transpose is swapping elements across the diagonal. So, for example, the element at (1,2) becomes (2,1), which is the same as before. So, the matrix is symmetric, meaning it's equal to its transpose. So yes, P is Hermitian. That's good because it's an observable.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P, and specifically, we want the probability that the outcome is 0.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state vector. So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Then, find which eigenvalue is 0, and then compute the probability.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value, but wait, no, because the question is about the probability of a specific outcome, which is 0.

Wait, but maybe I should find the projection of the state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Because if the state is a linear combination of the eigenvectors, the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

So, step 1: Find the eigenvalues of P.

Let me attempt to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write the matrix (P - λ I):

Row 1: [ -λ , 1/√2, 0 ]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved, but let me proceed.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ) ] + 0 [ something ]

Wait, more systematically, using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors.

Expanding along the first row:

det = (-λ) * det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] ) 
      - (1/√2) * det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]] )
      + 0 * det(...)

So,

det = (-λ) * [ (-λ)*(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
      - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] 
      + 0

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ) [ λ² - (1/2) ) ] → (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ /√2) ] → -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ)/(2)

So, putting it together:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) + (λ/2) = 0

Expanding:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ³ + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ(-λ² +1)=0 → λ(1 - λ² )=0 → λ = 0, or λ²=1 → λ=1 or -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.

So, when we measure P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. The question is, what's the probability of getting 0.

Next, I need to find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P.

So, solving (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So, the matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

We need to solve P v = 0, where v is a 3x1 vector (a, b, c).

So, setting up the equations:

Equation 1: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0 c = 0 → (1/√2) b = 0 → b = 0.

Equation 2: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = 0 → (a + c)/√2 = 0 → a + c = 0 → c = -a.

Equation 3: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0 c = 0 → same as equation 1, so again b=0.

So, from equation 1, b=0. From equation 2, c=-a. So, the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a) → a*(1, 0, -1).

So, the eigenvectors for λ=0 are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, with basis vector (1, 0, -1) up to normalization.

Wait, but I should normalize it. Let me compute the norm of (1,0,-1). The norm squared is 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So, the eigenspace for λ=0 is spanned by this vector.

Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

We need to find the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

The projection amplitude is given by the inner product of |ψ> and the eigenvector |v>.

So, the amplitude <v|ψ> is:

[1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] · [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Calculating this:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*1 → (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, let me compute that again.

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1) → -1/sqrt(2)

(-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 → -1/sqrt(2)

Adding these together: (-1 -1)/sqrt(2) → (-2)/sqrt(2) → which is -√2, since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2). So, sqrt(2) squared is 2.

So, the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this amplitude.

So, | -sqrt(2) |^2 → (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation because the state vector isn't normalized. Oh wait, wait a minute! Did I normalize the state vector?

Let me check the norm of the state vector |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state vector isn't normalized. That complicates things because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized (i.e., have norm 1). So perhaps I need to normalize it first.

Wait, right. Because when you have a quantum state, it must be a unit vector. So, perhaps the given state is not normalized, and that's an oversight in the problem statement? Or perhaps it's a mistake, and I have to proceed as if it's normalized, but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the state vector is normalized.

Wait, the state vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So, the norm is sqrt(6), which is greater than 1.

But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized, so perhaps the given state is actually ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6) ?

Because in reality, you can't have a state vector with a norm greater than 1. So, perhaps I should consider the state vector as (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

But the problem statement didn't mention normalization, so maybe I should proceed without it, but that would mean the probabilities might sum to more than 1, which is impossible. So, perhaps in this problem, the state is given as unnormalized, but the observable is such that the probabilities still make sense.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed as if the state is normalized. Let me think: the state given is (-1, 2, 1). If I don't normalize it, then the probabilities I compute will be scaled by the squared norm, but when you compute the probabilities, the sum must be 1. So, perhaps I need to normalize the state first.

Let me proceed by normalizing the state vector.

So, the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

So, the components are (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Now, the eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

The amplitude is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

So, adding both terms: (-1/(2√3)) + (-1/(2√3)) ) = (-2/(2√3)) ) = -1/√3.

So, the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/√3)^2 = 1/3.

So, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Alternative approach: Without normalizing the state vector.

The given state vector is (-1, 2, 1)^T.

The eigenvector for λ=0 is (1, 0, -1)^T. Let's call this vector v.

The inner product of the state vector with v is (-1)(1) + 2*(0) + 1*(-1) = (-1) +0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm of v is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).

So, the projection is ( (-2) ) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) → because the state vector has norm sqrt(6), and the eigenvector has norm sqrt(2).

Wait, but if the state isn't normalized, the probability is [ (inner product)^2 ] / (norm of state)^2.

Wait, yes, the formula is P = |<v|ψ>|² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no. Because the probabilities are calculated as the squared modulus of the projection onto the eigenspace, divided by the squared norm of the state vector. Because when the state is not normalized, probabilities are calculated as (amplitude squared) divided by the squared norm.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula is the probability is |<v|ψ>|², where |v> is the unit eigenvector, and |ψ> is the state. But if |ψ> isn't normalized, then the inner product is (v† ψ), and the probability is [ |v† ψ|² ] / [ ψ† ψ ].

Wait, I think that's correct.

Because |ψ> might not be a unit vector, so the probabilities are given by ( <v|ψ> )^2 divided by <ψ|ψ>.

Wait, no, actually, in quantum mechanics, the state |ψ> must be normalized, so perhaps this problem assumes that the given state is normalized. Let me check.

The given state is (-1, 2, 1), which has a norm squared of 6, so the norm is √6. So, if the state is not normalized, the probabilities would be calculated as (amplitude)^2 divided by (norm)^2.

Wait, but the eigenvectors are normalized. So, when the state is not normalized, the probability is | <v|ψ> |² / ||ψ||².

Wait, no, because the state must be normalized for the probabilities to sum to 1. Otherwise, probabilities would be scaled, which doesn't make sense.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to normalize the state first.

So, the correct state vector is |ψ> = ( (-1), 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector |v> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product <v|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)).

Which is (-1 -1 )/(sqrt(12)) ) → (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → (-1)/sqrt(3).

The squared modulus is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So, the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C) is 1/3. So, the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the eigenvector.

Wait, when I found the eigenvectors for P when λ=0, I found that the vectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So, any scalar multiple, including negative, is also a solution.

So, the eigenvector I used is correct.

Another way to approach this is to find the matrix P and compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation value, but that's not directly helpful for finding the probability of a specific outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the matrix product P|ψ> and see if it's a multiple of |ψ>, but that's only if the state is an eigenvector, which it's not in this case.

Wait, but the state is not an eigenstate of P. So, when we measure P, the outcome is one of the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are determined by the projections onto the eigenspaces.

So, the calculation I did earlier should be correct. The probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector \( \psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \) corresponds to the desired measurement outcome.

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \). Solving the system of equations, the eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is of the form \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 0 \\ -a \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Projection of \( \psi \) onto \( \mathbf{v} \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is given by the square of the projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenvector \( \mathbf{v} \). First, normalize the state vector \( \psi \). The norm of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The projection amplitude is:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Calculating the inner product:

\[
\langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( (-1) + 0 + (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude:

\[
P = \left| \langle \mathbf{v} | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
