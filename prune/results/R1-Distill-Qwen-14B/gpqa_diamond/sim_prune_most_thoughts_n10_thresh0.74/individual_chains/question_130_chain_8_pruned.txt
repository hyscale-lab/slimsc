Okay, so I've got this question about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and how they absorb light from quasars. The question is about finding the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when neutral hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths, it's called the Lyman alpha forest. The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So, the light we observe from these quasars must be shifted into the optical range.

Redshift (z) is calculated using the formula z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. Here, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength would need to be in the range that optical telescopes can detect. I think optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm, but wait, that's in nanometers. Oh right, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV.

So for the ground-based telescopes to see it, the wavelength after redshift must be longer than about 400 nm (since optical starts around there). Wait, or is it that the quasar's emitted light in the Lyman alpha is absorbed by the hydrogen, and the absorbed line is shifted into the visible range? So the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be >= 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) because anything shorter is in UV and not observable from the ground.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the UV. But if the cloud is at some redshift z, the wavelength we receive would be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). But if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, then the Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) would be redshifted into the optical range, which is visible from the ground.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The quasar's own light is at higher redshift,
