Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let's read it carefully. Hmm. It's about an isolated system of identical particles with charge and their arrangement. The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Alright, I need to think through this step by step.

So the problem states: There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, so the setup is that one charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. Since all 12 are at the same distance, I guess they form a spherical shell around P. Or maybe arranged in some other symmetric way, but the distance is the same for all.

Since the particles are identical and each has a charge of 2e, which is twice the elementary charge. So each charge is +2e, I assume? Well, the sign might matter for the potential energy, but since we're looking for the minimum energy, maybe the arrangement would dictate if it's positive or negative.

Wait, but the problem says the charges are identical, so the 13th is fixed. The others are at 2m. So the system's potential energy comes from the interactions between all these charges. Since the system is isolated, we have to calculate the total potential energy.

To find the minimum energy, I think we need to arrange the charges such that the potential energy is minimized. Because like charges repel, the system's potential energy will be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all the 12 charges are at radius 2m from P, any two of them are at a distance of... Well, wait, if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two of them isn't just 2m. Because if you have two points on a sphere, the distance between them depends on the angle between them. For a sphere, the maximum distance is the diameter (4m in this case, but wait, the radius is 2m so diameter is 4m, but wait no, the radius is 2m, so diameter is 4m. No, wait, the radius is 2m, so diameter is 4m, but the distance between two points on the surface depends on the angle. Oh wait, but if all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are the same, perhaps it's a regular icosahedron or something? But wait, 12 points on a sphere, perhaps arranged as vertices of a regular polyhedron. But maybe I don't need to worry about the exact distance between the 12 charges because the problem might have a simpler approach.

Wait, another thought: the system's total potential energy includes contributions from
