Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component of the spin operator. So, I guess the state is a linear combination of these two states.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if iâ‰ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right! That's the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices have 1s off the diagonal for X, Y, Z. So in this case, the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, right? Because sigma_x has 1s where iâ‰ j in a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the operator matrix would be [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Hmm. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. Those states are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because sigma_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1.

Wait no, wait. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are 1 and -1, so the operator in question has eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*-1 = -hbar/2. So the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates of the operator. Alternatively, I could compute the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate of the operator.

But wait, maybe it's easier to diagonalize the operator. But since the operator is diagonal in the sigma_x basis, perhaps I can express |alpha> in that basis and find the coefficients, which would give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator has eigenstates |+x> and |âˆ’x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and
