Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, so it could point in any direction. 

I remember that for spin systems, the Hamiltonian is often proportional to the spin operator. Since Pauli matrices are involved, this must be a spin-½ system. So the eigenvalues should relate to spin in the direction of n, scaled by ε.

Wait, Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a dot product with a unit vector n, you're effectively creating a spin component in the direction of n. So the operator σ · n is a matrix that has eigenvalues ±1 because each Pauli matrix does, but when scaled by ε, the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. So σ · n is a sum of each component: n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each of these terms squared would give I, the identity matrix, because σ_i² = I for i=x,y,z. So when you square σ · n, you get (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)². Let's compute that.

Expanding that, it's n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + 2n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + 2n_y n_z σ_y σ_z.

Since each σ_i squared is I, the first three terms are (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. But n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So that gives I.

The cross terms involve products of sigma matrices. I remember that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k if i≠j, but I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I know that the Pauli matrices satisfy [σ_i, σ_j] = 2i ε_ijk σ_k, so their commutators are non-zero, but for the square of σ · n, perhaps the cross terms can be simplified.

Wait, maybe there's a better way. Since σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues can be found by considering the trace and determinant. The trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero, and n is a unit vector (so the sum of their products would also have trace zero). The determinant of σ · n is (Tr(H)^2 - Tr(H^2))/4, where H is σ · n. But Tr(H)=0, so determinant is (-Tr(H^2))/4.

Wait, alternatively, the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix with trace T and determinant D are [T ± sqrt(T² -4D)]/2. Since Tr(H)=0, the eigenvalues are ±sqrt(D*4), but wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. So σ · n will also have eigenvalues ±1, because it's a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by direction. Because, for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n is a spin component in that direction, and spin-½ systems have eigenvalues ±1/2 times some factor, perhaps.

Wait, no, wait. Let's consider the eigenvalues of σ · n. Let me think in terms of the eigenvalues of any component. Suppose n is along z, then σ · n is σ_z, whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1. But wait, wait—no! Wait, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues ±1. So σ · n would also have eigenvalues ±1 if the same logic applies, since n is a unit vector.

Wait, but considering that H is ε times σ · n. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are ±ε. So looking at the options, Option B says +ε, -ε. That must be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the eigenvalues of a spin operator S · n (where S is spin) for spin-½ systems are ±ℏ/2. But wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε σ · n. Wait, σ is the Pauli matrices, which are 2x2 matrices, and in the context of spin-½, S = (ℏ/2) σ. So if H = ε σ · n, then that's equivalent to H = (2ε/ℏ) S · n. The eigenvalues of S · n are ±ℏ/2. So H would have eigenvalues (2ε/ℏ) * (±ℏ/2) )= ± ε. Oh, that makes sense. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

So the answer should be option B: +ε, -ε.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

The Pauli matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are 2x2 matrices with eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) represents the spin component in the direction of \(\vec{n}\), and it inherits the eigenvalues \(\pm 1\) from the Pauli matrices.

When scaled by the constant \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\). This result is consistent with the fact that the eigenvalues of a spin-½ system in any direction are proportional to \(\pm \varepsilon\), where \(\varepsilon\) is the energy scale.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(\pm 1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).
- **Option B**: \(\pm \varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(\pm \varepsilon \hbar / 2\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \(\hbar\).
- **Option D**: \(\pm \hbar / 2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
