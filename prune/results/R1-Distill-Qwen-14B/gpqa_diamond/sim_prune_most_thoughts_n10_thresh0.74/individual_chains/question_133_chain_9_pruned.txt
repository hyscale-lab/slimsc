Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water.

Wait, I think this is a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is a weak acid (since it's a dihydrogen phosphate) and Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base. Right, so buffer solutions involve a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

So the idea is that the solution will resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, and in this case, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, which might help in finding the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question isn't directly asking for pH. It's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Or wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's get this straight.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. The steps are:
1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, the species present will be a mix of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-, depending on the pH.

But in this case, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4 is 2Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so this is a buffer between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So, the buffer is using the second dissociation step, which has a Ka2 of 6.2e-8.

Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant Ka is Ka2. So, if I can find the pH, I can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-.

But how does that help me find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be PO4^3-?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. But in this buffer, the solution is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so PO4^3- would be very low because the pH is around where the second dissociation occurs. The third dissociation (HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+) has a much lower Ka. Since the second Ka is 6.2e-8 and the third is 1.8e-12, the pH here would be around the pKa2, so the third deprotonation (to PO4^3-) would be minimal. So, the concentration of PO4^3- might be negligible compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So, maybe I need to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, and then use the third dissociation to find PO4^3-.

Wait, but why would I do that? Because PO4^3- is a very weak base, so at pH around pKa2 (which is ~7.2, since Ka2 is 6.2e-8, pKa2 is about 7.21), the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. So, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- is governed by the third dissociation.

So, perhaps I can model the solution as a buffer with the second dissociation, find the pH, then use the third dissociation to calculate the PO4^3- concentration.

Alternatively, maybe I should first compute the molarities of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in the solution.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each.

For KH2PO4:

Mass = 1.00 g, Mw = 136.09 g/mol.

Molar = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00733 moles.

Similarly for Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Mass = 1.00 g, Mw = 177.99 g/mol.

Molar = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 moles.

Wait, wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O
