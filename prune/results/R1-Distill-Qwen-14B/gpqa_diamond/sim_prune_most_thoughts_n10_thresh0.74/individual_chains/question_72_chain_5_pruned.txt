Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm. Let me try to unpack each step and see what's happening here.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached to the 7 position. I think the structure has that bicyclic system, which is a bridge structure.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide and heat... Oh wait, that's the Fittig reaction conditions, right? But wait, the Fittig is for coupling aryl halides, but here we have dibromomethyl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a SN2 reaction? Or perhaps elimination?

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two methyl groups, each with two bromines, attached to carbons 5 and 6. So the structure is cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, when sodium iodide is used with vicinal dihalides, it can lead to elimination. Like the E2 mechanism, forming an alkyne. Because if you have two adjacent dihalides, and you have a base like NaI, which might provide iodide ions, but wait, NaI is more about maybe a substitution. Alternatively, the reaction conditions could be for a nucleophilic substitution or elimination.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a bicyclo ring with an oxygen substituent. Maybe it's acting as a nucleophile? Or perhaps this is a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, the bicyclo structure is a norbornene derivative. When treated with a dihalide and a base, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or coupling.

Wait, another possibility is that the bicyclo compound is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But the dienophile here would be the dihalide? No, the dihalide isn't a typical dienophile
