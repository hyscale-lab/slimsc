Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for each step. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) and NaCN with reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that the cyanide ion usually does nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones can't undergo the same kind of addition as aldehydes because they're less reactive. Oh wait, but under certain conditions, like with acid catalysis, maybe?

Wait, but when I think about the addition of HCN to ketones, the reaction typically forms a cyanohydrin. Like, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the proton comes from water or acid. Wait, so the reaction would be something like R2CO + HCN â†’ R2C(OH)CN. But in this case, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that matches the product given. But wait, the reagent here is NaCN, which is a source of CN-.

So, the reaction would proceed via acid catalysis because the carbonyl is not very reactive. So, maybe re
