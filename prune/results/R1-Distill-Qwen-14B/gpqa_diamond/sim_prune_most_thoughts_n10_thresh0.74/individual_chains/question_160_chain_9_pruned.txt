Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field intensity patterns. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Wait, so when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in that case, this setup reduces to a circular aperture, and we're dealing with the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the single-slit diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with rings of dark and light around it. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at specific angles. The first minimum is at a particular angle, and then the next minima follow. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima, so that would be the angle from the first minimum to the second minimum.

Wait, wait no. The question says the first two minima. Wait, the central maximum is the brightest, then the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second minimum is the next dark ring. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be the angle for the second minimum minus the angle for the first minimum.

But I'm a bit confused about the formula for the minima in a circular aperture. I think the formula for the minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture is given by something like sinθ = (mλ)/(πa), where m is an integer. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me get this right.

Wait, for single-slit diffraction, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer, but that's for a slit of width a. But for a circular aperture, the situation is a bit different. The minima in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture occur when the path difference between the light waves from the edge of the aperture to a point on the screen causes destructive interference.

The formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the condition a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer starting from 1. Wait, no, I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, I think it's more like the minima occur at θ where mλ = a sinθ, but I'm a bit shaky. Or maybe it's (m + 0.5) λ? Hmm.

Wait, I think for circular apertures, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. Because I remember the formula for the first dark ring in the Airy disk is θ = 1.22 λ/(π a) multiplied by 180/pi to get in radians, but wait no. Wait, the formula I remember is the first minimum occurs at θ such that a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So θ ≈ 1.22 λ /
