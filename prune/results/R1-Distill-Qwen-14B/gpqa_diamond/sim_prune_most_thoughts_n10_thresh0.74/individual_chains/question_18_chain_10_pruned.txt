Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

Hmm, the question talks about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses more than our Sun. The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method. I remember that EW stands for Equivalent Width, which is a measure used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere under the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) assumption.

The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I also have the Sun's photospheric composition: for iron (Fe), 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5. For magnesium (Mg), it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. 

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si1 / n_Si2). 

Wait, let me break down the given data:

For Star 1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. So, [Fe/H] is log(nFe1 / nH1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. 

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That's the ratio of silicon to iron abundance. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3. 

For Star 2:
- [Mg/H]_2 =0. So nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun. 
- [Mg/Si]_2= 0.3. That's log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

I think I need to find the ratios of silicon in each star relative to the Sun, and then take their ratio. Let's compute each star's [Si/H] and then find n_Si1/n_Si2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Since the problem wants the ratio of silicon in Star1 to Star2, I can compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take 10^( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ), which would give the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Yes, that's right. Because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun). So the ratio between two stars is 10^{([X/H]_1 - [X/H]_2)}.

So first, compute [Si/H] for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0, so nFe1/nH1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun). 

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

Let me denote the solar ratios as follows:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = Feh_sun = 10^{(7.5 -12)} }? Wait, wait. Because the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value.

So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 → no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → so nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, wait. So for the Sun, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). And nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nFe1/nH1= nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = n
