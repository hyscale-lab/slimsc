Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me four plasmid options, and I need to choose the right one. Hmm, where to begin?

First, I remember that when cloning a gene into a plasmid, especially for expression in E. coli, the plasmid must have the correct promoter and the gene must be in frame. Also, the plasmid should have a multiple cloning site (MCS) where the gene can be inserted. Commonly, BL21 strains use plasmids with T7 promoters because they require induction (like with IPTG) to express the protein. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter.

Looking at the options, all of them start with ATG... which is the start codon. Wait, no, looking closer, each option is a DNA sequence. Oh right, plasmid sequences are DNA, so the actual coding sequence would be part of this.

Wait, the question gives the amino acid sequence of P53. So the DNA sequence in the plasmid should code for that. The plasmids have different sequences, so I need to find which one correctly encodes the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, but the options are all long strings of DNA. How can I figure this out without knowing the exact sequence? Maybe I should look for the start and stop codons.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So they all have that. But the stop codon would be
