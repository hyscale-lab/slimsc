Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from these techniques is given, and I need to determine the chemical formula from the options provided.

First, let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum:

- There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe this compound has an alcohol (-OH) group or a carboxylic acid group, which would have even broader and stronger peaks. Alternatively, it could be an -NH stretch, but I don't think that's the case here because the other peaks might suggest something else.

- There are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl, perhaps an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds. Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl? Because that would lower the wavenumber.

Hmm, but wait, sometimes the 1650 region can also be due to an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe an amide? No, I don't think so because amides have N-H stretches which would show up in the IR, but that's not mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, such as in an ester group where the carbonyl is conjugated with an aromatic ring or something else.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data:

- Several peaks are observed, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have a double bond somewhere, maybe as part of an ester or another group.

In the Mass Spectrometry (MS) data:

- There's a fragment peak at m/z =45. So I need to think about what fragments would give a mass of 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but wait, 45 is more likely a bigger fragment. The molecular ion could break into parts. Let me think, 45 could be the fragment of an ethyl ester group or something similar.

Wait, 45 is a common mass for a (CH₂CH2O) group? Or maybe it's the mass of a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH3CO+ ion (acetyl), which has a mass of 43, but that's not matching. Hmm, 45 could be another possibility. Maybe it's a (CH₂)₂O group, but let me calculate the molecular weight.

Wait, 45 in mass corresponds to CH3COO- or something. Let me calculate:
