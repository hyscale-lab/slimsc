Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total, which is a bit confusing. Wait, wait. A benzene ring is 6 carbons, so if it's di-substituted, that would add two more substituents. But wait, no. Wait, di-substituted benzene has two substituents attached to the ring. So the total number of carbons would be 6 (from benzene) plus the substituents. Oh, but the substituents could be more than one carbon each.

So the compound has a total of 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if each substituent is a methyl group (each substituent is one carbon), then 6 + 2 = 8, but that would make the total 8? Wait, 6 from the ring, plus two substituents each of one carbon. So 6 + (2Ã—1) = 8? No, that would be 8 carbons total. Wait, 6 for the ring, 2 substituents each with one carbon: 6 + 2 =8, yes. But wait, maybe substituents could be more. Like maybe one substituent is a methoxy group (
