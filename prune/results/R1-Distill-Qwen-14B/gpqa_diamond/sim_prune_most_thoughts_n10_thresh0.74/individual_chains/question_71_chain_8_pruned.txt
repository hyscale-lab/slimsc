Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? I remember that this method helps detect planets by the gravitational influence they have on each other, causing variations in the transit times of the planets as they pass in front of their star from our perspective.

The setup says there are five planets, Planet_1 through Planet_5, all with circular orbits and in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh wait, orbital resonance is when the planets' orbital periods have a ratio of small integers, like 2:3 or something. That makes their orbital positions repeat in a regular pattern, leading to strong gravitational interactions. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here for calculating the temperature ratio.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that simplifies things because albedo affects how much light is reflected and absorbed. Equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the greenhouse effect, but since the albedo is the same, those factors are equal, so it comes down to their distances.

Equilibrium temperature formula, if I remember correctly, is T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π^2 * σ ) )^(1/4) ) * ( ( (1 - a) / D )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe a simpler approach. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = T_eff * ( ( R^2 ) / (4 D^2) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The star's effective temperature (T_eff) relates to the flux it emits. The planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the stellar flux it receives. The flux decreases with the square of the distance. So the formula is T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) ), but wait, no, that's when the star's radius and distance are considered. Alternatively, the planet's equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4), but L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, but perhaps for the ratio, the star's factors will cancel out. Because we're comparing two planets orbiting the same star, so their equilibrium temperatures will be proportional to the inverse square root of the square root of their orbital distances. Hmm, no, let me get this right.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( ( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4) )

But since L is the luminosity of the star and a (albedo) is the same for both planets, when we take the ratio of their temperatures, the star's terms and albedo will cancel out. So the ratio T4/T2 will depend on the ratio of their distances.

Wait, no, wait. Because T is proportional to (1/D^2)^(1/4), which is 1/D^(1/2). Because (D²) is
