Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, first, what's the deal with these symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations, right? So Poincaré is a bigger symmetry group. Then there's CP, which is charge conjugation combined with parity, and CPT, which involves charge, parity, and time reversal.

So in SMEFT, the operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, but wait, are all operators required to respect all of them? I think that the SM itself respects certain symmetries, so the effective theory should maintain those unless they're explicitly broken.

Wait, but the SM doesn't have CP symmetry. Like, the CKM matrix leads to CP violation. So does SMEFT respect CP symmetry? Or does it not have to, because the SM doesn't either? Hmm. Or maybe the operators are built in a way that preserves certain symmetries.

Wait, I think that the operators in SMEFT are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So if the SM doesn't have a symmetry, the SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to either.

Wait no, I think SMEFT
