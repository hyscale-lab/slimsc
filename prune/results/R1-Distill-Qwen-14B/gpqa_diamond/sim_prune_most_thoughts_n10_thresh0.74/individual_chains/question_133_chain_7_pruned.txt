Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphates. Let me read the question again.

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

Wait, I remember that phosphate buffers work by having a weak acid and its conjugate base. But here, I see KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, let's think about what these are.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So, when dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (the first dissociation) and the conjugate acid of HPO4^2- (the second dissociation).

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O). When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which comes from the second dissociation of H3PO4.

So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are conjugate acid-base pairs, so the solution is a buffer solution. The buffer resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.

The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. But in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^- (Ka1), then HPO4^2- (Ka2), and then PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate would actually be H3PO4, but in solution, it's more likely to be in one of the deprotonated forms.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-, but that's the third dissociation. But in this solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the orthophosphate ion is probably PO4^3-? Or is this a different context?

Wait, maybe the orthophosphate ion refers to the HPO4^2- or the H2PO4^-? No, I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. But in this solution, we have the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate ions. So, how much of PO4^3- is present?
