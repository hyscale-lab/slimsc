Okay, so I've got this question about organic compounds and the colors they absorb. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Oh wait, it's something about complementary colors, right?

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Wait, energy of the emitted light... Oh, right! When a substance absorbs light, it emits light of a different color. The energy of the absorbed light must be higher than the emitted. Because, I think, the energy levels relate to the wavelengths. Higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths.

So, using the formula E = hc/λ, right? Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. Oh, but wait, I need to find the wavelength of the absorbed light. Because the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is lower energy than the absorbed, I think.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. When an electron gets excited, it absorbs a photon with a certain energy. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed? Or maybe it's the other way around.

No, wait. The energy of the absorbed photon has to be higher than the emitted. Because in the dye, the electron is excited from a lower energy level to a higher one when it absorbs the photon. Then, when it drops back, it emits a photon with lower energy. So the energy of the emitted light is less than the absorbed.

Wait, but the question is about the absorbed light's color. So if the emitted is 2.33
