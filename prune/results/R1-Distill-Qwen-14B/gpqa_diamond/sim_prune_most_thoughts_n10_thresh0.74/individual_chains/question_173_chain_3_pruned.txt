Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, right? Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum. But wait, how exactly does that work again?

The question says an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, wait, I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is the key here. The principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, which is related to the uncertainty in velocity.

Momentum p is mass times velocity, so Δp would be mΔv, assuming Δv is the uncertainty in velocity. But wait, do I know the uncertainty in velocity here, or just the position? The problem gives me Δx, so I guess I need to find Δp from that.

So, starting with the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Once I find Δp, I can relate it to ΔE because energy is related to momentum.

Wait, but what's the formula connecting energy and momentum for an electron? Oh, right, the kinetic energy K.E. is (p²)/(2m), but that's when momentum is known exactly. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps I should think about the uncertainty in energy arising
