Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and figure out what's going on.

The question says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes. 

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Its weight increased by 3.60 grams. The second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight didn't change. The third tube has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams because CuO was formed. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the gases are. The setup involves passing the gases through different tubes. 

1. Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. It can react with water vapor. So, if the weight increased by 3.60 g, maybe the gas here is water vapor (H2O). Because Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb water, gaining mass. So, the increase is from the water in the gas.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, meaning no gas reacted with it. If the gas was CO2, for example, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3, causing the solution to increase in weight. But since it didn't, that suggests that there was no CO2 or maybe not enough for it to react? Or perhaps the gas was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, like maybe nitrogen or something inert? Or perhaps another possibility: maybe the gas was NH3? But wait, NH3 would react with Ca(OH)2 as well, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas was H2, which doesn't react with Ca(OH)2, but in that case, would it pass through? Hmm, not sure yet.

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, which implies that CuO was formed. CuO has a molar mass of about 80 g/mol (since Cu is 64, O is 16). So the moles of CuO formed would be 0.80 g / 80 g/mol = 0.01 mol. That means the gas reacting here must be something that reacts with copper upon heating. Common gases that do that include CO and H2. Wait, but CO would react with CuO in the presence of a catalyst, but here it's the opposite. Alternatively, H2 might react with CuO when heated, but wait, normally you need a catalyst for H2 and CuO to react. Oh wait, no, when H2 is passed over hot CuO, it can cause a reduction: H2 + CuO → Cu + H2O. So the gas here is likely H2. Or maybe CO, which would react with CuO under certain conditions.

But wait, in tube 3, the copper is red-hot, so perhaps it's acting as a catalyst. Or maybe the gas is CO, which upon heating could react. Let me think about the reaction if CO is passed over Cu.

Wait, CO doesn't react with CuO unless there's a catalyst, but if the copper is red-hot, maybe it's acting as a catalyst. Alternatively, another possibility is that the gas is H2. Let me think about the moles. The amount of CuO formed is 0.01 mol, which would correspond to 0.01 mol of O in CuO. But the O comes from the gas. Wait, if the gas is H2O, but that wouldn't
