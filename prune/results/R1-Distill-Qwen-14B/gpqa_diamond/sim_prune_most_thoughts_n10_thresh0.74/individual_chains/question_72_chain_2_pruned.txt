Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let me try to understand what's happening in each step of the reaction.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm not too familiar with that structure, but I know bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta is a norbornene structure. So, norbornene has two rings, right? The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. That probably makes it a bulky substituent, which might influence the reaction's stereochemistry.

Next, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, I think this is an elimination reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So maybe a substitution reaction is happening here.

Wait, but I remember that when you have dihalides and a diene, sometimes a Diels-Alder reaction can occur. Alternatively, if there's a possibility for elimination, maybe it's an E2 mechanism. Wait, but the substrates here might be reacting in some cycloaddition?

Wait, the starting material is a diene because it's hepta-2,5-diene. The other compound is a cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So, the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene must have two CH2Br2 groups attached to the cyclohexene.

So, the norbornene is reacting with two equivalents of this dibromomethylated cyclohexadiene. Sodium iodide is a good source of iodide. Maybe the Br is replaced by iodide? Or perhaps it's a substitution where the bromide leaves, and something else happens.

Wait, another thought: when dienes react with dienophiles, Diels-Alder is possible. But the norbornene is a diene itself. Or maybe it's acting as a dienophile? Let me think. The norbornene has two double bonds, but I'm not
