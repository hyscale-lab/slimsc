Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, each involving a reaction, and I need to pick the right reagents (A and B) from the options given. Let me break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? That's methylacetone or something. When ketones react with nitriles, I think the reaction might involve some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. Right, the cyanohydrin reaction. So that's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent is NaCN. So butan-2-one + NaCN + A. Oh wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, so it's the nucleophile here. The ketone will act as the electrophilic carbonyl. So under acidic conditions, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and then water is lost (but wait, no, maybe it's a different mechanism). Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-step process where the acid catalyzes the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, A must be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ (like in option A or B) or NaHSO3 (which is a source of HSO3^-; but wait, that's more of a base, maybe? Or perhaps a different acid catalyst).

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see the structure. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO, so adding cyanide would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, no, wait. Let me write that out. Butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO? No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when
