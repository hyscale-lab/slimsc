Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, an eigenvector of an operator corresponds to a state where the operator has a definite value, which is the eigenvalue. So here, the operator is P, and the eigenvalue is ħ/2. 

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down as I understand:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane would be P·n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in x-z plane, it doesn't have a y-component. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) perhaps? Wait, no, more accurately, since the direction is in x-z, the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is zero because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, perhaps the direction is given by angles θ and φ where θ is from the z-axis and φ is the angle in the x-y plane, but since it's in x-z, φ would be 90 degrees or something. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. 

Wait, maybe it's simpler. The direction n can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), since it's in the x-z plane. And since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So the operator P along n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

But wait, the problem says the eigenvector is for the operator P along direction n. So the operator is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

I need to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me construct P_n. 

P_n = n_x (ħ/2) [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the matrices, the (1,1) element is n_z, the (1,2) is n_x, the (2,1) is n_x, and the (2,2) is -n_z. 

Now, the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So, (P_n - (ħ/2) I) = (ħ/2)[ [n_z -1, n_x ], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, wait. Let me compute each element:

The matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I) would be:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, no. Because I is the identity matrix. So the (1,1) element of P_n is (ħ/2) n_z, and when subtracting (ħ/2) I, it's (n_z - 1) * (ħ
