Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I've studied a bit about pericyclic reactions before, but I'm not super confident. Let's try to break this down.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene, but I'm not entirely clear on the specifics. Wait, no, wait—the Cope rearrangement is specifically for 1,5-dienes, right? They undergo a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, but wait—this molecule is a bicyclo structure. So maybe I should draw it out to visualize better. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a bridge of two carbons and another of two, with a single bridge carbon. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Oh, wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group is on the 2nd carbon. And it's an azabicyclo, meaning there's a nitrogen in the ring. Oh, wait, the azabicyclo part—so the bicyclo has a nitrogen. So it's 2-azabicyclo, which means the nitrogen is at position 2.

Wait, so the structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bond
