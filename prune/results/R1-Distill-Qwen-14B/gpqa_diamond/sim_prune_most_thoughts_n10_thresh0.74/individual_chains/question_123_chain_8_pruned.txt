Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the Galaxy is stationary in its own frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it? Or is the ejecta moving, and the Galaxy is moving in the opposite direction from the ejecta's perspective? Oh right, because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. That means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s? Because of the symmetry in inertial frames when velocities are along the same line.

Wait, no. Because when you switch frames, velocities reverse. So if in frame E (ejecta), the Galaxy is moving at +60,000 km/s, then in frame G (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving at -60,000 km/s (towards the Galaxy). So yes, the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But wait
