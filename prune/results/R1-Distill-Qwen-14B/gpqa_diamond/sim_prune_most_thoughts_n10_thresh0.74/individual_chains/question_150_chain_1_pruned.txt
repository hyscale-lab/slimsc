Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let me take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, for degree of unsaturation: each double bond or ring counts as one. So, the formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down, the general formula for an organic compound is CnH2n+2OxNy. So, for C8H9NO, comparing to CnH2(2n+2)O... Wait, let's compute it properly.

The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But here, X (halogens) are zero. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a ring and some double bonds, etc.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me try to interpret that. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each 2H. These could be from aromatic protons, perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because para substitution gives two doublets each integrating to 2H. So maybe there are two aromatic rings attached somewhere?

The 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with another group, like -OH, but not sure. Alternatively, protons adjacent to an oxygen could be broad. Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system.

The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That might be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps part of an ethyl group attached to oxygen? Wait, the integration is 2H, so probably a CH2 next to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings, a CH2 group, and some oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, the molecular formula includes N. Oh, right, the formula is C8H9NO. So there must be an amine, maybe. But wait, the starting material is undergoing some reactions, so perhaps the N is involved in a substitution or something.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization. Diazonium salt formation. So, maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine. Because when you treat an aromatic amine with HCl and NaNO2, you get a diazonium chloride.

But wait, the initial NMR doesn't show any protons that would be from an amine. Oh, but maybe the amine is in a position that doesn't show up in the NMR, like maybe it's not protonated or it's in a different environment.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is a primary aromatic amine, then the reaction with HCl and NaNO2 would form a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with water (step 2), it might undergo hydrolysis to form a phenol. But wait, the third step is KOH and heat, which might induce elimination or some kind of condensation.

Hmm. Let me think about the structure. Let's try to build the structure from the NMR.

The aldehyde proton at 9.72 suggests a carbonyl group. The two aromatic rings (from the two doublets) might be attached to the rest of the molecule. The 3.66 ppm doublet could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an OCH2- group.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H) could be protons on a benzene ring with substituents that cause them to be deshielded, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're part of an enol or something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, and two aromatic rings.

Wait, let's think about the structure. If we have two benzene rings attached to a butyl chain or something, with a functional group in between.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons. Each benzene ring has 6 carbons, but if two rings are connected, perhaps via a side chain.

Wait, 8 carbons in total. So, two benzene rings, which account for 12 carbons, but no, that can't be right. Wait, wait, waitâ€”each benzene ring is 6 carbons, but if the molecule is perhaps a diphenyl compound, like two benzene rings attached to a central chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is diphenylbutanal or something.

Wait, but wait: the formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, two benzene rings would be 12 carbons, but that's more than 8. So that can't be. Oh wait, no, maybe each benzene is part of the same molecule but sharing some carbons. Alternatively, perhaps one of the rings is substituted with another group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent.

Wait, let me try to draw this structure. Let's see:

An aldehyde group (CHO), then perhaps a CH2 group, and then another substituent, which could be a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets, which suggests two different aromatic environments.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Because cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring with a CH2-CHO group.

But wait, cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O, but our formula here is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and another group. Let me think.

Wait, if the molecule is something like phenylpropanal with another substituent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde attached to another group. Wait, but I'm not getting it yet.

Let me try to think about the reagents again. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is for diazotization. So, the starting compound must have an aromatic amine. Diazonium salts are formed from aromatic primary amines.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have any signals that would correspond to an NH group. Maybe the amine is in a position where it's not exchangeable, or perhaps it's deprotonated. But in the NMR, I don't see any signals around 5-6 ppm that would correspond to an aromatic amine's NH. So perhaps the amine is not part of the aromatic ring but elsewhere.

Wait, the molecular formula has an N. So the starting compound must have an amine group. Let me think: perhaps the starting compound is an aniline derivative, where the amino group is attached to a benzene ring, and the rest of the structure is a side chain.

Wait, for example, if the structure is something like benzene with an amino group attached, and the side chain has the rest of the molecule, including the aldehyde.

But if the starting
