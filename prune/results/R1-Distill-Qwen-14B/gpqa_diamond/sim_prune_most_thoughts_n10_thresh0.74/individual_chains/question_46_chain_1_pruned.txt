Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Oh yeah, it's a transition metal catalyst, usually based on ruthenium. Metathesis means the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, and it can do ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. But in this case, we're starting with an alkene, so probably a ring-closing reaction?

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3. So it's CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So positions 1 to 5.

So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure would be:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Oh yes, because the double bond is from C1 to C2, and the methyl branch is on C3.

But wait, the molecule is racemic, which means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So each molecule has a stereocenter where? Let me see. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, the third carbon (C3) has a CH(CH3) group. So C3 is attached to two CH2 groups, one CH2CH3, and the CH from C2 (which is double bonded to C1). Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (double bond) and C4. Wait, no, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. So C3 is connected to CH₂, CH(CH3), and on either side, but wait, maybe the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.
