Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm. Let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my biology classes.

The question says a scientist is running a quantitative PCR, which I know is used to measure the amount of a specific DNA or RNA. He made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which means each cycle doubles the DNA perfectly. The R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly—like a straight line with no scatter. The slope is -3.3. Wait, what does the slope mean in a qPCR curve?

Oh right, in qPCR, the calibration curve is usually a plot of Ct values versus the log of the starting quantity. The equation for the line is usually something like y = mx + b, where y is the Ct, x is the log of the copies. The slope (m) is related to the efficiency. I think the formula for efficiency is E = 10^(-1/slope). So if the slope is -3.3, then 1/slope is about -0.303. So 10^(-1/slope) is 10^0.303 ≈ 2, which makes sense because 100% efficiency means each cycle doubles the DNA (so efficiency is 2, which is 100%).

Now, looking at the data. Each concentration has three technical replicates with Ct values. The concentrations are 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per microliter. The Ct values for each are 33.9-34.5, 30.6-31.2, 27.3-27.9, 24-24.6, 20.7-21.3. So each set of three has a small variation, like about 0.3 Ct difference.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So why would there be discrepancies? The options suggest possible explanations. Let's look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. That's not right because qPCR is used for quantification. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target amount. Well, since the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, the Ct should accurately reflect the amount. Unless there's some other issue, but the data seems to fit a perfect line. So why is B an option? Maybe because the Ct values don't correspond as expected? Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each ten-fold dilution should correspond to a change in Ct of about 3.32 (since 10 is about 2^3.32). Oh wait, in the data, each dilution (like 100,000 to 10,000) is a ten-fold decrease. Let me compute the expected change in Ct. The first point is 100000 copies with Ct ~34, then 10000 (1/10th) Ct ~30.6, which is a decrease of about 3.4 cycles. Oh, the slope is -3.3, so each log10 decrease in copies would cause an increase of about 3.3 in Ct. Wait, because the slope is negative. So when copies decrease, Ct increases. So for a ten-fold dilution, the Ct should increase by about 3.3 (since each ten-fold is a log10 step). So each dilution step in the data is about 3.3, like from 34.2 to 30.9 is about 3.3 difference. So that's correct. So option C's statement is that the ten-fold is more than 3.3 cycles. But the data shows exactly about 3.3. So C would be incorrect, because the ten-fold is exactly what the slope is expecting.

Option D: Deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the replicates, each has a range of about 0.3 Ct (like 33.9, 34.2, 34.5). So the deviation is exactly 0.3. But wait, the option says 'more than 0.3'. So if the deviation is exactly 0.3, then D is not correct. So the data has a deviation of 0.3, which is within acceptable limits. So why are there discrepancies?

Wait, the question is asking which explains the discrepancies in his results. So what's wrong here. Let me think again. The efficiency
