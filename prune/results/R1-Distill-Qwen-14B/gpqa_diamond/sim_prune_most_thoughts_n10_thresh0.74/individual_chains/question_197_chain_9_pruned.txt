Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, which are different organic compounds.

First, I should look at the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X to determine its structure. Then, I can figure out what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely due to O-H or N-H stretch. But since the compound is reacting with HI and phosphorus, which are typically involved in elimination or maybe some kind of substitution, perhaps it's a carbonyl group.

Another peak is at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be deshielded more. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. However, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, but in the IR, I have a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. For a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. If it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl is a bit higher, say 1720, which fits. So maybe it's an aldehyde group, which would have a proton around ~9-10 ppm. But the NMR shows 10.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But then the IR would have an O-H stretch in the 3400-2500 region, which is a broad peak, which matches. Also, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, which matches the IR.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then in the NMR, the aldehyde proton wouldn't be present. So perhaps the 10.5 ppm is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. But the integration is 1H, which is consistent with one -COOH group.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Let me think about that. If the compound is an aldehyde, then the IR would have the aldehyde stretch around 2820 and 2720, but that's usually for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, the IR data given is from 3400-2500, which includes O-H and maybe C-H stretches. But perhaps the 3400–2500 cm-1 is the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid. So that would suggest a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the aldehyde's C-H stretch is usually around 2800-2700, which is a bit lower than what's given. The given IR data includes 3400–2500, which is a broad region. So, O-H stretch (like from a carboxylic acid) would be in that region. That makes sense.

So, perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's proceed.

Looking at the aromatic region in the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)

This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets each integrating to 2H would imply two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which are adjacent. So, for example, in para-substituted benzene, the protons are in two sets of two, each with coupling (d), leading to two doublets. So the substituents are in the para positions.

So, the aromatic part is probably a para-substituted benzene ring. Now, what substituents are present on the benzene?

The other peaks in the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Let me try to interpret these. The 1.4 ppm, d (doublet), 3H integration suggests a methyl group attached to something that's split into a doublet. Maybe a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to something else. Like in an isopropyl group or a butyl group.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 would be around 1.2-1.4 ppm, and
