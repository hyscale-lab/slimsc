Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two pairs of particles, A+ and A−. 

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass-energy of A is 300 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, the rest mass energy is given by m_A c², so that's 300 MeV here. 

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, that probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate it as being non-relativistic? Or perhaps, since it's moving slowly, the energy involved is just the rest energy. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the process is annihilation. Annihilation usually involves converting matter and antimatter into energy, but in this case, it's producing these particles A. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their masses. A proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², right? And the antiproton has the same mass as a proton since it's the antimatter counterpart. So each has a rest mass energy of around 938 MeV.

So the initial rest mass energy is m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The products are two A+ and two A−. So four particles in total. Each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV, so the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. 

Wait, but 1200 MeV is less than 1876 MeV. That can't be right because, in an annihilation process, the rest mass energy of the products must be less than the initial rest mass energy plus any kinetic energy involved. Wait, no, actually, in annihilation, the initial particles' rest mass energy is converted into other forms of energy, like kinetic energy of the products. But wait, in this case, the initial rest mass is 1876 MeV, and the products have 1200 Me
