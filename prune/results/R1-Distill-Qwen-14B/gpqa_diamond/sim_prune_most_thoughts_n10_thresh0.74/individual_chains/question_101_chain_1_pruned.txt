Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says that 3-methylpyrrolidine undergoes an acid-catalyzed reaction with compound A and produces 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to choose the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I'll try to visualize the structures. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The 3 position has a methyl group. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, so the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. Cyclohexylidenemethyl sounds like a cyclohexane ring with a double bond attached to a methyl group. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring where one of the rings is a double bond, and the methyl is connected to that double bond? Or perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl group would be something like a cyclohexyl group attached to a double bond, right? So, maybe the structure is such that the cyclohexane ring is connected via a double bond to a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring system where the methyl is attached to the double bond. Or maybe it's a cyclohexane ring where a CH2 group is part of a double bond attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, another approach: the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is at position 1 of the pyrrolidine. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So that would be a group where a cyclohexyl group is connected via a double bond to a methyl group. So the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexyl (but with a double bond). Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine. I think cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring attached via a double bond, so the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a single bond? Or maybe it's a cyclohexenyl group that's attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, another way: The substituent is (cyclohexylidene)methyl. So, the methyl group is attached to the cyclohexylidene group. The cyclohexylidene group is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, perhaps between the ring and the substituent. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl group, which is then attached to the pyrrolidine. So it's like the pyrrolidine's N is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a cyclohexene ring. Or maybe it's a bridge or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring expansion or some kind of ring-forming
