Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. 

So, the nucleus is initially at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, right? So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact way mass is divided. Let me think. The sum of their rest masses is 0.99M. And one is twice as massive as the other. Let me set up some variables.

Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one would be 2m. So total rest mass after fission is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. So the lighter fragment is 0.33 M, and the heavier is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So yeah, that part is correct.

Now, because the initial momentum is zero, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So, their momenta magnitudes are the same. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. But since momentum is mass times velocity, for the heavier fragment (mass 2m) and lighter (mass m), their velocities must be in such a way that m*v1 = 2m*v2. Because their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So m*v1 = 2m*v2 → v1 = 2 v2. Hmm, is that right? Wait, actually, each fragment's momentum is in opposite directions. So, the momentum of the first is p, and the second is -p. So, for fragment 1: p = m v1. Fragment 2: p = 2 m v2. Wait, no, because the second fragment is 2m. So p = 2m v2. But since the momentum directions are opposite, let's say fragment 1 has momentum p and fragment 2 has momentum -p. So, p = m v1 and p = 2 m v2. So, m v1 = 2 m v2 → v1 = 2 v2. So v1 is twice v2. Interesting.

But wait, this is all in the non-relativistic case. Because if the velocities are high, we might need to consider relativistic effects. The question asks about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So I need to compute both and find the difference.

The problem says the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. So T1 is the kinetic energy of the 2m fragment. So, we need to compute T1 correctly using relativity and then compare it with its non-relativistic value.

But wait, another thing to remember: in fission, not all the mass is converted into kinetic energy. Some becomes binding energy or other forms. However, in this problem, the sum of rest masses is 99% of the initial, which suggests that the rest masses of the two fragments are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So, the initial rest mass was M (300 GeV). So the two fragments' rest masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. So, the sum is 0.99 M, which is 99% of the initial. So the remaining mass (1% of M) must have been converted into kinetic energy and other forms, like binding energy maybe? Or perhaps it's the energy released in the fission. Wait, but in reality, mass-energy is conserved, so the energy released is the mass difference times c squared. But in this problem, perhaps they’re telling us that the sum is 0.99 M, so the mass lost is 0.01 M. So, that 0.01 M c squared is the energy released, which would go into the kinetic energy and any other energies (like neutrinos or gamma rays, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so I think we can ignore that and assume it all goes into kinetic energy of the fragments).

But wait, in reality, energy released in fission is (M - sum m_i) c², where sum m_i is the rest masses of the products. So, here, the rest masses sum to 0.99 M. So the energy released is (M - 0.99 M) c² = 0.01 M c². This energy is the total kinetic energy plus any binding energy, but the problem might be simplifying it to say that all this energy goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. So, the sum of their kinetic energies is 0.01 M c².

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, which suggests that the rest energy of the system after fission is 0.99 M c². The initial rest energy was M c², so the difference is 0.01 M c², which must be the total kinetic energy plus any other energies, but the problem says to ignore electrons, which I think refers to not considering the rest mass of electrons, but perhaps the kinetic energy of the fragments is the only thing considered here.

Wait, no: the problem says to ignore the electrons, so perhaps we can treat the fragments as purely nuclear, no electrons involved in their mass.

But in any case, the main point is that the total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total energy before was M c². After fission, the total energy is sum (rest energies) + sum (kinetic energies). So,

M c² = (m1 c² + m2 c²) + (K1 + K2)

Where m1 and m2 are the rest masses, and K1 and K2 are the kinetic energies.
