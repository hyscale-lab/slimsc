Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there's a series of reactions after that. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll start by analyzing the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's probably a carbonyl proton, like an aldehyde or maybe an aromatic aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde group. Alternatively, it could be an alpha proton next to a carbonyl, but considering the triplet, perhaps it's the aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are typically singlets unless there's some coupling. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to an electronegative group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like from a phenolic OH? But phenols are usually broader, and this is a triplet. Maybe not.

Looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions. These are doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps in para positions. For example, two benzene rings where in each ring, the protons are in a para-substituted position. Let me think: for a benzene ring with substituents, the protons could split into doublets if they're adjacent. Wait, if I have two para-substituted rings, maybe they are part of a di-substituted structure, like two phenyl groups attached to a central chain.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps some exchange, like an -OH group or maybe a conjugated diene. But since it's 2H,
