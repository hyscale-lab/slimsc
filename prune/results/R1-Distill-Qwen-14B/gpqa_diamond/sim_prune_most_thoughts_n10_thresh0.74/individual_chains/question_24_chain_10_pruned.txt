Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B) 18, C)22, D)12.

Let me start by writing down what I understand:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, the substances in X must have double or triple bonds because they can react with bromine (Br2). Decolorizing bromine suggests the presence of unsaturated bonds like alkenes or alkynes.

2. When mixture X is treated with platinum under heating, it undergoes a reaction (disproportionation) to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, Y's compounds are saturated, meaning they don't have double or triple bonds anymore.

3. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is used widely as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it has no more unsaturated bonds.

4. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X. That might mean that the two components in X are such that they don't have conjugated double bonds, perhaps isolated or something else.

So, the key here is to figure out what X and Y are, and then find the hydrogen atoms in X's components.

First, let's think about Z. Since Z is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y, and it's a single hydrocarbon, maybe the components in X and Y are each converted into Z upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So, each component of X must have multiple unsaturated bonds. Then, when X is heated with Pt, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation implies that the same element is both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe the components in X are such that they can undergo such a reaction.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. Each of them would have to undergo some reaction. Hmm, perhaps each component in X is a diene or something that upon hydrogenation gives Z.

Wait, but if X's components are converted into Z upon hydrogenation, that suggests that each component in X is a di-substituted something. For example, if X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think about Z's composition.

Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. So, let's calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let’s assume Z is an alkane because it's a hydrocarbon resulting from hydrogenation, which adds hydrogen. But wait, hydrogenation usually saturates double bonds, so Z might have only single bonds.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, the mass of H is 14.28%, which would mean that if the molar mass is M, then (mass of H)/(M) = 0.1428.

Hydrogen has an atomic mass of 1, so let's say Z has n H atoms. Then, (n * 1)/(M) = 0.1428.

Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon, so its molecular formula is CxHy.

So, the mass of H is (y * 1) / (12x + y) ) = 0.1428.

Hmm, so (y)/(12x + y) = 0.1428.

Let me calculate 0.1428 as a fraction. 0.1428 is approximately 1/7, because 1/7 is about 0.142857. So, y/(12x + y) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying: 7y = 12x + y → 6y =12x → y=2x.

So, the formula is CxH2x. That's a general formula. Let's think about possible hydrocarbons that fit this.

CxH2x could be ethylene (C2H4), but that's a diene. Wait, but ethylene is C2H4. So, x=2, y=4. So, 4/(24 +4)=4/28=1/7, which is about 14.28%. So, that fits.

Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon produced by hydrogenation. So, if Z is ethylene, but wait, ethylene would be C2H4. But hydrogenation would add H2 to make it ethane, C2H6. Wait, but that doesn't fit our previous calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, if Z is a product of hydrogenation, then it's the fully saturated form. So, if X's components are alkenes or alkynes, after hydrogenation, they become alkanes.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Z is CxH2x, which is a general formula for alkenes. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, let's try specific examples.

Suppose Z is ethane, C2H6. Then, its hydrogen mass fraction is (6 *1)/(2*12 +6) )=6/(30
