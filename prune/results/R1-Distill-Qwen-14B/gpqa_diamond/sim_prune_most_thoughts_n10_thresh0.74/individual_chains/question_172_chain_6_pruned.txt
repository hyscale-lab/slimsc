Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation relating the energy levels in a star's atmosphere. Let me think this through step by step.

The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation is something like n_i / n_j = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)). Here, n_i and n_j are the number densities of particles in energy levels i and j.

In this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant k, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So the energy difference ΔE is k times some temperature-related term? Or wait, maybe it's given as ΔE = E_i - E_j, and the ratio is n_i/n_j.

The problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So, n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j) ? Or maybe it's the other way around, because star_1 has higher excitation. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the problem says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited". So n1_i / n1_j is higher than n2_i / n2_j by a factor of 2. So the ratio for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

So, the ratio for each star would be (n_i / n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, but wait, energy is E_i - E_j, which is positive if i is higher than j. So if the energy level is higher, the exponent is negative, leading to fewer particles in that level. Wait, but the question is about the excitation, which I think refers to the number in the higher energy level. So if star_1 is more excited, maybe more in the higher level, which would mean that the exponential is bigger, but wait, no, because the exponential is negative. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the excitation temperature.

Wait, another approach: the Boltzmann equation is often written as (n_i / n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the ratio is less than 1. But in this problem, star_1's excitation is higher. Oh, wait, maybe the question is about the higher energy level being more populated. So if star_1 has more population in the higher level, then E_i is higher, so the exponent is negative. So (n_i /n_j) for star_1 is higher than that for star_2. So, perhaps n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). Or wait, maybe the opposite? Because if star_1 is more excited, perhaps n1_i is higher for the same n_j. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "excited in a specific energy level". So, the number of atoms in the excited state (n_i) is higher in star_1 compared to star_2. So, n1_i is twice n2_i, for the same level i? Or is it the ratio n_i/n_j that's twice as
