Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. But let's see what I can do.

The problem says I have a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should figure out the total moles of each acid and each base in the mixture. Because when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, what's the order here? Oh, right, I should consider all the acids and all the bases, then see which one is in excess.

So, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with acetic acid: volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, and it's 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2: the volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, and molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's think about the acids. Acetic acid is a weak acid, but HCl is a strong acid. So, both will contribute H+ ions.

The total moles of H+ from the acids: CH3COOH contributes 0.05 moles, and HCl contributes 0.08 moles. So total H+ is 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 moles.

Wait, but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. So when these mix, the H+ and OH- will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, the reaction between the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the base:

Total H+ = 0.13 mol
Total OH- = 0.18 mol

They neutralize each other. So, how much remains?

0.13 mol H+ + 0.13 mol OH- → 0.13 mol H2O.

So, the OH- left is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait—what about the acetic acid? Because after neutralization, some of the acetic acid might be converted into acetate ions. Or does the neutralization affect the acetic acid?

Hmm. Let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when OH- is added, it will react with the H+ from acetic acid as well. So the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, which is a strong acid, because strong acids react faster. Then, any remaining OH- will neutralize the acetic acid.

Wait, no, it's all in the same solution. So, all H+ ions from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So, the initial H+ is 0.05
