Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with coordination complexes and stability constants. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.

Hmm, so I remember that stability constants tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form a complex with ligands. Higher β means a more stable complex. The complexes here are different in terms of how many SCN- ligands they have. The blue ones are probably the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think means they have two SCN^- ligands.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So I need to figure out how much of the Co is in each complex form and then find the percentage for the blue ones. I think blue is Co with two SCN- ligands, which would be the Co(SCN)₂²+ complex, right?

So the complexes are:

- Co²+ (the free ion)
- Co(SCN)²+ (β1)
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2)
- Co(SCN)₃²+ (β3)
- Co(SCN)₄²+ (β4?)

Wait, no. Wait, let me think about the stability constants. The stability constant β is for the formation of the complex. Each β corresponds to adding a SCN- ligand. So for each step, the β is the constant for adding that ligand.

So for the first complex, Co(SCN)²+, β1 is 9. For the second, Co(SCN)₂²+, β2 is 40. But wait, sometimes the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise β's. So for Co(SCN)₂²+, the formation would involve two steps: Co²+ + SCN^- → CoSCN²+ (β1=9), and then CoSCN²+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40). So the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)₂²+ would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, for Co(SCN)₃²+, the overall β would be β1*β2*β3 = 9*40*63 = let's compute that. 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680. And for Co(SCN)₄²+, it's β1*β2*β3*β4 = 22680 *16. Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, the given β4 is 16. So that would be β4 for adding the fourth SCN-. So the overall β for Co(SCN)₄²+ would be 9*40*63*16. Let me calculate that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

But wait, the β given in the problem are for each successive addition. So the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn. So the four possible complexes (n=1 to 4) have overall βs of β1, β1β2, β1β2β3, and β1β2β3β4.

But wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for adding another SCN-.

So the species in solution are:

1. Co²+ : no ligands.
2. Co(SCN)²+ : 1 ligand.
3. Co(SCN)₂²+ : 2 ligands.
4. Co(SCN)₃²+ : 3 ligands.
5. Co(SCN)₄²+ : 4 ligands.

Wait, but why does β4=16? That seems lower than β2 and β3. Hmm, maybe the stability doesn't keep increasing with each ligand. So perhaps the fourth ligand is less favored.

Now, the goal is to find the percentage of dithiocyanato complexes, which I assume are the ones with two SCN- ligands. So that would be Co(SCN
