Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the target molecule is. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Also, there's a carbonyl group (the aldehyde) on the same carbon as the substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 1-(...), which probably means the substituent is on carbon 1, and the aldehyde is also on carbon 1. Oh wait, no, the aldehyde is at the end of a chain. Let me think again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group attached. So the substituent is on the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has both an aldehyde group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The main chain is cyclohexane, and one of the carbons (let's say position 1) has two groups: one is the aldehyde (CHO), and the other is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH) attached to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is like -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl.

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so HCâ‰¡C- attached). So we have to figure out how to convert this into the target, which has an aldehyde and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

Let me think about the reagents in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

The options involve a series of reactions. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, step 3 is written twice as 3 and 4, probably a typo. But the steps might not make sense. So first, NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, maybe deprotonating an alkyne to form a metal acetylide. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl. Wait, if we have an alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane), adding NaNH2 (a strong base) would deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide. But the alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, which is
