Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime, tau_0, is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. So the observed lifetime, tau, would be gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that: 27 / 3.41 is approximately let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, which leaves 3.13, so 7 plus (3.13/3.41) ≈ 7.915. So gamma is about 7.915.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let's calculate that: 7.915 *8 is around 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s = 6.332e-15 s.

Wait, but why are we calculating the lifetime? Oh, right, because the decay length depends on the lifetime. The decay length L is the velocity multiplied by time. So L = v * tau. But v is approximately c for particles moving at relativistic speeds, right? So L ≈ c * tau.

But wait, to be precise, beta is v/c. So the velocity is beta*c, and gamma is (1/(sqrt(1-beta²))). So perhaps it's better to compute beta as well.

Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), and beta can be found
