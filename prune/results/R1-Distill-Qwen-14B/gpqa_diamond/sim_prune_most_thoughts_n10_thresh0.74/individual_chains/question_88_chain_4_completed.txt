Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question about rotavirus and something about GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, they tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and give them to mice orally. Then, when they look with in vivo imaging, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid. Others get stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. But then they find fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cells. When they sequence the variable heavy chain genes, there's high variability.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens in the intestine. So when the rotavirus proteins are given orally, they get taken up by these patches.

The question is about the process happening when they see high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. The options are four different processes: somatic hypermutation, complement activation, class switching recombination, and VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each process. Somatic hypermutation is a process where B cells introduce mutations in the variable regions of their antibodies after activation. This increases the diversity of the immune response. This happens during the immune response, especially in secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches.

Complement activation is part of the immune response, but it's more about the activation of the complement system, leading to things like opsonization or lysis of pathogens. Not directly related to the variability in the heavy chain genes.

Class switching recombination is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which involves recombination of the heavy chain gene. This affects the isotype but not the variability in the variable regions themselves.

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during the primary immune response, establishing the initial diversity of B cells. But since the question is about a process that occurs after antigen exposure, I think it's not VDJ because that happens earlier, during maturation.

So in this scenario, the B cells are activated by the rotavirus antigens. Once activated, they start to proliferate and undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their B cell receptors. This would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

Wait, the question says they isolated the proliferating cell population. After activation, B cells start dividing and producing more cells. During this proliferation phase, they undergo hypermutation. So the process here must be somatic hypermutation.

Also, in Peyer patches, the antigen is taken up by M cells, presented to B cells. This leads to activation, which then triggers these processes. So yeah, the high variability is likely due to somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence is observed in Peyer patches, and sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of proliferating cells reveals high variability. This suggests a process occurring after antigen exposure that increases the diversity of the immune response.

1. **Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors after antigen activation, increasing diversity. It occurs in secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches during the immune response, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

2. **Complement activation**: This involves the complement system targeting pathogens but does not directly contribute to variability in antibody genes.

3. **Class switching recombination**: This changes the antibody isotype but does not affect the variability of the variable regions.

4. **VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow to establish initial diversity, not during the immune response after antigen exposure.

Given that the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is observed after antigen activation and proliferation, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to increase diversity.

Answer: A
