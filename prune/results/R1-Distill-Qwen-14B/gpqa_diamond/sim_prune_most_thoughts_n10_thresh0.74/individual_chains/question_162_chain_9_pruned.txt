Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the given metric is:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because it's written in terms of dx² and dy² multiplied by some function. Right, so the metric is conformally flat since it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric in x and y.

I remember that the area element in such a metric would involve the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in two dimensions, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal here, and each component is multiplied by the same factor, the determinant should be (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So sqrt of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The metric in 2D is usually given as ds² = g_{11} dx² + 2 g_{12} dx dy + g_{22} dy². In this case, g_{12} is zero, so the determinant is g_{11} * g_{22} - (g_{12})². Since g_{11} = g_{22} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root is 32/(4 - x² - y²), as I thought before.

So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The metric given here might represent a pseudosphere.

The metric looks similar to the metric for a hyperbolic space. Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is something like ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² - a²), right? Or wait, sometimes it's written as (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² + r²), but in Poin
