Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see what's going on here. The question says that they've introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. HA tags are typically used for protein detection and purification, so that makes sense.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. Then they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression. But they can't overexpress the protein. Hmm, so why?

Looking at the plus strand sequence they provided, I'm supposed to find the issue. Let me read the sequence carefully. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the start of the coding sequence should be the HA sequence followed by GADD45G.

Wait, the first few nucleotides after the start codon (ATG) should code for the HA tag. I think HA is a small peptide, maybe around 11 amino acids. Let me try to translate the beginning of the provided sequence to see what's happening.

The provided sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CC... Let's translate that. ATG is methionine (start). TAC is tyrosine. So the first two amino acids are Met, Tyr. Hmm, the HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYD (or similar), which starts with Tyr. So that seems okay.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag is inserted correctly? Let me think about the construct. They introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence should start with HA followed by GADD45G. But maybe the way it's done messed up the reading frame?

Wait, no. The plasmid is constructed correctly, I think. Let me check the sequence again. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC G... So the first codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), G... Hmm, that doesn't look like the HA peptide sequence. Wait, the HA peptide is usually around 11 amino acids, but perhaps they've only inserted a part of it, or maybe the HA sequence isn't present correctly.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is inserted as a DNA sequence, but in the wrong reading frame. Let me think. The HA tag is added to the N-terminus, so the initial ATG would start the HA coding sequence. But the given sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... Wait, that might not be the HA sequence. Let me recall the HA sequence. The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its DNA sequence is usually around 34 nucleotides long, like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAT GAT GAT
