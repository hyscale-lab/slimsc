Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The compound is an acetate, so the structure probably has an acetyl group (OAc) attached to some kind of alkene, right? Because the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. 

Looking at the NMR data: the signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), and 1.6 (3H, d). 

Wait, the acetate group usually gives a singlet around 2.1 ppm for the methyl group. That matches the 2.1 ppm peak with 3H. So that's the OAc part.

The other peaks are in the proton region. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large coupling constant J=16Hz. That's probably a vinyl proton. In an ester like propenyl or butenyl acetate, the structure would have an -OAc group attached to a CH2-CH2-CH2- group or something with a double bond.

Wait, but butenyl would have more carbons. Let me think about the structures. 

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Butenyl could be either CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl) or maybe a butenyl with a double bond in a different position. Wait, but butenyl could be either cis or trans if it's a double bond.

Wait, the options are Cis or Trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, but propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? Or maybe CH2CH=CH-OAc? Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

But then in the NMR, the protons adjacent to the double bond would show coupling. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2-OAc-CH2-CH2, but wait no, the structure is OAc-O-C-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, wait. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So in propenyl acetate, R is propenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CH
