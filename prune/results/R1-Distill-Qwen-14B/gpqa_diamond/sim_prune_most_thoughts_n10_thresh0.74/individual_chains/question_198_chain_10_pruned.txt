Okay, so I have this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So, for each complex, β = [complex]/([Co][SCN]^n), where n is the number of SCN- ions in the complex.

The complexes here are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) for n=1 to 4. So each β corresponds to the respective complex. So β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for the dimer, etc.

But I'm a bit confused about what the blue dithiocyanato complex is. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN^- ions, right? So that's the n=2 complex.

Wait no, wait. Wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups? No, wait, in terms of complexes, the first complex is Co(SCN)^1, the second is Co(SCN)_2^0, the third is Co(SCN)_3^-1, and the fourth is Co(SCN)_4^-2. So the dithiocyanato would be the second one, n=2. So the blue complex is the n=2 one, which has β2=40.

Wait no, the question says blue dithiocyanato. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex, which is the n=4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, cobalt complexes with thiocyanate can form different colors. The [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is usually blue, I think. So that would be the n=4 complex, which has β4=16. So the question is asking for the percentage of this blue complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, in the solution.

Ah, that makes sense. So the problem is about determining the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is for the nth complex, like β1 is Co(SCN), β2 is Co(SCN)₂, etc.

So the problem reduces to calculating the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, which has the stability constant β4=16.

But wait, when you have multiple complexes, the distribution of Co among the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co and SCN^-.

I remember that the distribution can be calculated using the formation of each complex step by step. The general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex, then sum them up.

Alternatively, we can use the concept of the formation of each complex, considering the stepwise formation.

So, the idea is to compute the fraction of each complex (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4) and then find the percentage of the n=4 complex.

The total concentration of all Co species will be the sum of [Co], [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], and [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. But since the total Co concentration is given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and assuming that the solution is in equilibrium, the sum of the concentrations of all these species equals c(Co).

Wait, but actually, the initial state is that Co is in solution as Co²+ and SCN^- is present. The complexes form, so the total Co remains the same as the initial concentration. So the sum of all [Co] species equals c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

But how to calculate the fraction of each complex?

I think the method is to assume that the formation of the complexes proceeds through successive addition of SCN^- to Co²+.

The formation of each complex can be considered stepwise, so the fraction of each complex depends on the stability constants and the concentrations.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex, starting from the most stable one and moving to the least.

But I'm a bit rusty on the exact method. Let me recall.

The fraction of the nth complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to n, multiplied by the (n)th term, divided by a normalization factor.

Wait, another approach is to compute the conditional formation constants and the distribution ratios.

Alternatively, I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = [CoSCN_n] / c(Co) = (β1β2...βn * [SCN]^n) ) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... )

Wait, no, more accurately, for each n, the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (sum over k=0 to 4 of (β1β2...βk) [SCN]^k ) )

Wait, but wait. Because each β is the cumulative stability constant for the nth complex. Or are they stepwise stability constants?

Wait, I think the β values given here are the overall stability constants. Or maybe they are the stepwise constants. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, when you have multiple stability constants, are they stepwise or overall? Let me think.

If β1 is the stability constant for CoSCN, β2 is the constant for Co(SCN)₂, but is β2 = β1 (CoSCN) * β2' (where β2' is the constant for adding another SCN to CoSCN to form Co(SCN)₂)? Or is β2 the overall constant for Co(SCN)₂?

I think that the given β's are the overall (cumulative) stability constants. Because the problem statement says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes" which suggests βn is the formation constant for the nth complex.

Wait, but sometimes stability constants are given as stepwise. Let me check: the stepwise stability constant K1 is for Co²+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+; K2 is for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)₂^0; and so on. So each step has a K, and the overall βn would be the product of K1*K2*...*Kn.

In this problem, it's not clear whether the given β's are the stepwise or the overall. Let me read the question again.

The question states: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Hmm, the way it's phrased, βn is the stability constant for the nth complex. So β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the overall stability constants for each complex are given.

So the formation of each complex is a separate reaction. So to find the concentration of each, we can write the expression for each.

But that complicates things because the formation of higher complexes would affect the lower ones. Because the formation of the second complex depends on the first, etc.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the complexes are formed stepwise. So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, the second is [Co(SCN)₂]^0, third [Co(SCN)3]^-1, and fourth [Co(SCN)4]^-2.

The formation reactions are:

Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+  β1 = [ [CoSCN]^+ ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-] ) = 9

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)₂]^0  β2 = [ [Co(SCN)₂]^0 ] / ( [CoSCN]^+ [SCN^-] ) =40

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)3]^-1  β3=63

[Co(SCN)3]^-1 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)4]^-2  β4=16

So the stepwise constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the overall constants for each complex would be the product of the stepwise constants up to that point.

Wait, but in this problem, the βs given are the stepwise or the overall? The question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes", which suggests that each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex, i.e., the stepwise constants.

Wait, no. Because the stepwise constants are for each addition, while the overall constants (β_total) for the nth complex would be β1*β2*...*βn.

So if the given β1=9 is the stepwise for the first complex, then the overall beta for the first complex is 9, for the second it's 9*40=360, for the third 9*40*63= 22680, and for the fourth 9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but wait, the problem
