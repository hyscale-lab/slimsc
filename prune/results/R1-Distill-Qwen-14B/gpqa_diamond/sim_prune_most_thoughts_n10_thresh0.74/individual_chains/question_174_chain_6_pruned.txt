Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation of T1. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the set-up: An atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial mass is 300 GeV, but the two fragments add up to 0.99 * M. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So M_initial is 300 GeV, but M1 + M2 = 0.99*M. So, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, but the sum is 297 GeV? Because 0.99 * 300 is 297.

Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. When it splits into two fragments, their rest masses add up to 297 GeV. So, the mass difference is 3 GeV. That must mean energy is released, right? Because the mass decreases, so energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fragments.

Now, the problem says that the more massive fragment has kinetic energy T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation.

Wait, but let me parse the question again: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So, the correct T1 is relativistic, and the approximate is classical. We need to compute T1_rel - T1_classical, I think.

Wait, or perhaps it's the other way around? No, the question says "the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1". So, correct minus classical.

Now, how do I approach this? Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the two fragments will have equal and opposite momenta. So, their momenta must
