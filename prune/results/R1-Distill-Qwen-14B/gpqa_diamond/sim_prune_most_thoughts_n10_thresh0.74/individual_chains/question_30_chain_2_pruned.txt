Okay, so I've got this question about organic compounds and the light they absorb. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that a textile dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and it emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to figure out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others, right? Like in fluorescence or phosphorescence. So the energy it emits is less than the energy it absorbs because some is lost as heat or other processes.

Oh right, the energy levels relate to the colors. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted one. Because when the molecule gets excited, it absorbs higher energy (lower wavelength) and then emits lower energy (higher wavelength) light.

So the emitted energy here is 2.3393 eV. To find the absorbed energy, I think I need to use the energy difference. But wait, how? Oh, maybe I should recall the equation E = hc/位, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, I remember that in conjugated systems, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels determines the wavelength absorbed. The bigger the conjugated system, the smaller the energy gap, so it absorbs longer wavelengths (like red) and emits maybe in a different region.

Wait, but this is about emission. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So to find the absorbed energy, perhaps I should consider that the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. Like E_absorbed = E_emitted + some energy loss, but maybe a simple approach is to think in terms of the energy levels.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between energy and wavelength. Because energy and wavelength are inversely proportional. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, lower energy means longer wavelength.

I think the emitted light is at 2.3393 eV. Let's find the wavelength for that. The formula is E = hc/位. So 位 = hc/E.

The constants: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J路s, speed of light c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But energy E is given in eV, so maybe I should convert that to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

So E in Joules is 2.3393
