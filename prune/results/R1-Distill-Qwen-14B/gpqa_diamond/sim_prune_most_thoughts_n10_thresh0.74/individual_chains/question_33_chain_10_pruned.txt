Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because cycloaddition reactions can be a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. They involve a diene and a dienophile. So I should figure out which compound is the diene and which is the dienophile.

Looking at 2,5-dimethylthiophene, its structure is a five-membered ring with sulfur, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is aromatic, but when it's non-aromatic, it can act as a diene or dienophile. Wait, but in this case, since we're heating it, maybe it's acting as a diene? Or maybe as a dienophile?

Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5 on the furan ring. Furan is an electron-rich diene, but when it's substituted with electron-withdrawing groups like ketones, it becomes a good dienophile because the electron-withdrawing groups activate the ring for that role.

So, putting that together: furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile, and 2,5-dimethylthiophene is the diene. Wait, but wait, can thiophene act as a diene? Thiophene is aromatic, so maybe it's not the diene. Or perhaps under certain conditions, it can lose its aromaticity to act as a diene.

Wait, another thought: 2,5-dimethylthiophene. The positions 2 and 5 are adjacent to the sulfur, which is in position 1. So the structure is like S with CH3 at positions 2 and 5. If this is in a non-aromatic state, maybe it can act as a diene. Alternatively, perhaps the dienophile is the thiophene here. Hmm.

Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction typically involves a conjugated diene (the diene) and a dienophile, which is something like a double bond with electron-withdrawing groups, making it more reactive. So furan-2,5-dione has two ketones, which are strong electron-withdrawing groups. So that should be the dienophile.

So the diene must be 2,5-dimethylthiophene. But wait, thiophene is a five-membered ring with one double bond. To act as a diene, it would need to have conjugated double bonds. Oh wait, but thiophene has only one double bond. So maybe the thiophene isn't the diene. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I got it mixed up. Maybe the dienophile is the thiophene and the diene is furan-2,5-dione? No, furan-2,5-dione is more likely the dienophile because of the two ketone groups. So which one is the diene?

Wait, maybe
