Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We're supposed to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c times the lifetime, but I might be mixing things up. Let me think. Oh right, the mean proper lifetime (tau) is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ, and the uncertainty in time Δt is tau. So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, Planck's constant over 2π. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, is that correct? Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width of the resonance. So the lifetime tau is given by tau = ħ/(Γ). Yes, that sounds right. Because the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ/2, maybe) and time uncertainty (tau) is about ħ. Oh wait, actually, I think the formula might be Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get that straight. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime tau by tau = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the inverse of the lifetime, in natural units. So if Γ is in GeV units, then tau in seconds is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s, I think. Let me check the units. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, then tau (in seconds) would be ħ (GeV·s) divided by Γ (GeV), so the units cancel, leaving seconds.

Once I have tau, the lifetime, I need to find how far the meson travels before decaying. That depends on its velocity. The mean decay distance is c multiplied by tau, but only if the particle is moving at a
