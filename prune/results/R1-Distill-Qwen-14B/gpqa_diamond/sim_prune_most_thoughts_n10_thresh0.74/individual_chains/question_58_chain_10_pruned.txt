Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these theories, but let me think. Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the theories seem non-sensical. So regularization is a way to handle those infinities, making the math workable.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never needs this regularization. So which of these theories don't have these divergences, or perhaps they naturally don't require regularization because they're already finite?

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations, right? In the classical sense, there are no quantum effects, so no infinities from loop diagrams or anything. Oh wait, but in reality, classical theories can still have issues like the infinite charge density of a point charge. But when you go to quantum theories, those problems get worse. Wait, but the question is about high energies. Wait, no—classical ED is a theory in itself, not a quantum one. So perhaps it doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Or does it even have any infinities in the first place?

Wait, in the classical theory, for a point charge, the electric field goes like 1/r², so the energy and charge densities become infinite at the origin. But I don't think that's considered a divergence in the same way as quantum field theory. Because in quantum theories, loop integrals give infinite results that need to be regularized. So Classical Electrodynamics might not require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But does the question consider that? The question is about when the theories are used at high energies. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the other options. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) definitely requires regularization because it has loop divergences. The one-loop corrections, like the electron self-energy, produce divergent integrals. So regularization is needed. Same with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It has things like the beta function, which tells us about the running of coupling constants. But I think QCD is asymptot
