Okay, so I have this question about a quasar observation and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, let's think through this. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I remember some key points.

The question says that observations show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Then, the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I'm trying to remember what this means. Oh, right! This must be related to the Lyman-alpha forest or something about absorption lines. Wait, no, the Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm, which is UV. Maybe this is the Lyman limit or another series?

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Could this be the Lyman series for a different element or perhaps a different ionization state? Or maybe it's about the Lyman break? Oh, right! The Lyman break is a feature in galaxy spectra where the flux drops at a certain wavelength due to hydrogen absorption. For the Lyman series, the first line is at about 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), but the Lyman limit is actually at 91 nm. Wait, but the peak is at 790 nm. That's in the near-infrared, which is longer than visible light.

Wait a second, if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, and the flux drops below that, maybe it's the so-called Lyman limit being observed in a higher redshift. Because the Lyman limit is at 91 nm, but if it's
