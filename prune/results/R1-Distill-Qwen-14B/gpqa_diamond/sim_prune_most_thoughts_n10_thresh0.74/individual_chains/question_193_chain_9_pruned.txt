Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance—parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx, which is parallax, is equal to 1 over distance (in parsecs, I think), right?

Wait, yeah, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means d = 1/plx.

So the problem says N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute d into that. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes (1/plx)^5, which is (d)^5. Because (1/(1/d))^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but d is the distance. So N is proportional to d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up something here.

Wait, the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So I think that's
