Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics is like the energy operator, right? So eigenvalues of H would give the possible energy levels of the system.

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. Oh wait, ε is an energy constant. So the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right? And when you take the dot product with n, it's like summing the products of each Pauli matrix component multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So H is a matrix that's a linear combination of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, what's the trace of this operator? The trace would be the sum of the diagonals. The Pauli matrices are traceless because each σ_i has trace zero. So H should also be traceless. That might be useful later.

Eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix, say σ_x, are ±1. But in this case, H isn't just one Pauli matrix; it's a combination of all three, weighted by the components of n. But wait, the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix combination like this should still be ±1 times some factor.

Wait, no, because the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian and have eigenvalues ±1, but when you scale them, the eigenvalues scale. However, in this case, H is ε times the dot product of σ and n. So σ ·n is a matrix, and since σ is Hermitian (each Pauli matrix is Hermitian), the product is also Hermitian. So H is Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are Hermitian.

Now, the eigenvalues of σ ·n. Let me think about σ ·n. Since n is a unit vector, the dot product would be a matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Wait, is that correct? Because σ ·n is a unit vector in terms of spin direction, but each Pauli matrix is scaled by n's components.

Wait, no. Let's think about it: the trace is zero, the determinant is (i^2)(trace something) or maybe just the product of eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is their product.

If the matrix is σ ·n, which is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ
