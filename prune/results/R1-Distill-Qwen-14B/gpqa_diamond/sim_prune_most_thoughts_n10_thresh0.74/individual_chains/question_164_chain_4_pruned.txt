Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary systems are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2, each with their own eclipse periods and radial velocity amplitudes. I need to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, the periods are given. System_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 of 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are different for each system. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

I think the key here is to relate the masses of the stars to their RV amplitudes. Oh right, in a binary system, each star orbits the common center of mass. The more massive star will be closer to the center, so it has a smaller orbit and hence a smaller RV amplitude. The less massive star has a larger orbit and larger RV amplitude.

So the mass ratio of the two stars is inversely proportional to the ratio of their RV amplitudes. Like, if one star has twice the RV amplitude, the other is twice as massive. Because the product of mass and velocity (since v is proportional to the size of the orbit) should be the same for both stars because they orbit the same center.

Wait, more accurately, the ratio of the masses is inverse to the ratio of the velocities. So if m1 and m2 are the masses of the two stars, then m1/m2 = v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are their respective RV amplitudes.

So for system_1: m1a/m1b = v1b / v1a. Let me compute that. The RVs are 10 and 5. So m1a/m1b = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. That means the total mass of system_1 is m1a + m1b. Similarly for system_2, the RVs are 15 and 10. So m2a/m2b = 10/15 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667.

But wait, I'm not sure if the periods come into
