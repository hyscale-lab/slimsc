Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, V(r) equals (1/2) m ω squared times r squared. Oh right, that's like a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The potential is similar to Hooke's law, so it's a harmonic oscillator scenario.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each giving a value and a number.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, in one dimension, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...). But in three dimensions, the total energy would be the sum of each direction's energy. So for three dimensions, each direction is independent, and the energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, people often use the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so energy is (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but sometimes they also parameterize it with n being the sum, so the energy levels are quantized as (n + 3/2) ħω, where n can be 0,1,2,... and each n corresponds to a certain state.

So the energy levels are determined by the number n. The ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3? Or maybe I'm mixing the terms. Let me think. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. Each time you increase n by 1, you get the next higher energy level.

So the third excited state would be n=3, because the ground state is the zeroth, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3.

So the energy for the third excited state would be (3 + 3/2) ħω. Wait, 3 + 3/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So energy is (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have this energy.

Now the second part of the question is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That's the degeneracy of the energy level. So for a given n, how many different (n_x, n_y, n_z) combinations can you have such that n_x + n_y + n_z = n. Each such combination corresponds to a different eigenfunction.

So for example, when n=0, only n_x=n_y=n_z=0 is possible, so degeneracy is 1.

n=1: the sum is 1. So possible combinations are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three possibilities. That's degeneracy 3.

n=2: possible combinations are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So that's 6 possibilities. So degeneracy is 6.

n=3: the sum is 3. The number of ways to write 3 as n_x + n_y + n_z where each is a non-negative integer.

Hmm, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n + 3 - 1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). So that's (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Therefore, the third excited state (n=3) has energy (9/2) ħω and degeneracy 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the n=3 case. Let me list all possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) where they sum to 3.

Possible cases:

- (3,0,0): and permutations.

- (2,1,0): and permutations.

- (1,1,1): only one way.

Wait, let's compute how many each.

Case 1: All are the same. Only (3,0,0). No, that's not all same. Wait, all same would be (1,1,1). So in this case, (3,0,0) has 3 permutations (since any of the three variables can be 3, others zero). Similarly, (2,1,0) can be arranged in 6 ways (3! =6). And (1,1,1) is only 1.

So total number of states: 3 (from 3,0,0) + 6 (from 2,1,0) + 1 (from 1,1,1) ) = 10. Yep, that's 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second excited state to $n = 2$, and the third excited state to $n = 3$. For $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The second part of the question asks for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, which is the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy is determined by the number of ways to write $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ as a sum of non-negative integers. For $n = 3$, the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:

1. $(3, 0, 0)$ and its permutations: 3 states.
2. $(2, 1, 0)$ and its permutations: 6 states.
3. $(1, 1, 1)$: 1 state.

Adding these, the total degeneracy is:

\[
3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$**

Answer: A
