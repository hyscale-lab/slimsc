Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a Ï€ bond within a conjugated system, moving along with sigma bonds. These reactions are pericyclic, so they might involve concerted mechanisms, maybe like electrocyclic or other pericyclic reactions.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out what each product is and match them to the options provided. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. So, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Structure-wise, that would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But with 1,1-dimethoxy, it's OMe groups on the first carbon. So the structure is OMe-O-C-NH2? Wait, maybe it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2. Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2? Hmm, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so 1,1-dimethoxy would be (OCH3)2CH2NH2? Or is it (OCH3)2 attached to the same carbon as the amine? Wait, ethan-1-amine has two carbons, with NH2 on the first. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be CH2(OCH3)2 attached to NH2. So the structure is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2.

But I'm not entirely sure about the structure, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, perhaps it's di-methoxy on the same carbon as the amine. So, the molecule is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2. Now, when this reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Wait
