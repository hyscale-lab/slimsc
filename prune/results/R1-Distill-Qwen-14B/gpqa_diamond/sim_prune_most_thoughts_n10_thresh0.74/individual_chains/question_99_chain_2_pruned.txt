Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but in this case, since the options have a COOH group, it's likely an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have broad and strong O-H absorption because the -OH is both acidic and hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group. So that makes sense.

Next, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has a carbonyl group. The broad peak at 3000 and the strong at 1700 together suggest a carboxylic acid. So the compound is likely a substituted acetic acid or something similar.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so we can rule out any double bonds. So the structure isn't something like an alkene. Looking at the options, all the compounds have a COOH group, which is a carboxylic acid, so that fits with the IR data.

Now the NMR signals: there's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complex. Let's think about splitting patterns. A doublet means each proton is split by one neighboring set. A triplet would be two neighboring sets, and so on.

Wait, the splitting is due to neighboring protons. So the more splitting, the more adjacent groups the proton is next to. For example, a doublet of triplets implies each peak is split into a doublet by one set and a triplet by another. But wait, maybe it's the other way around; perhaps the splitting is from two different neighboring groups. It's a bit confusing. Alternatively, a quartet is from three neighboring protons (n+1 where n=3), like a CH2 group next to another CH2 (giving a quartet). Hmm, but the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading that. The description says, "a doublet of triplets of quartets" and another is "a doublet of triplets of triplets." So each of these signals is a multiplet resulting from coupling with multiple sets of protons.

Alternatively, maybe the first is a doublet of triplets (each peak split into a triplet by one set and a doublet by another set?), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex, like from adjacent groups with different numbers of protons.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which structure would lead to such splitting in the NMR.

Let me list the options again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Structure: It's
