Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Alright, first, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with a strong base like NaOH, it forms the acetate ion. The pH changes during the titration because the solution goes through different stages: before any base is added, during the titration, at the equivalence point, and beyond.

So, let me break this down into parts. First, I'll figure out what's happening before the titration even starts, then move to the 25% titration, and finally the equivalence point.

Wait, but wait—the first step is diluting the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. So the diluted acetic acid's concentration would be 0.025 M. Let me confirm that. Because the volume doubles, so the number of moles stays the same, but concentration is moles/volume, so yes, 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M after doubling the volume.

So, now we have 40 cm³ (20 + 20) of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH will react with the acetic acid.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form the acetate ion and water.

So, the moles of acetic acid initially are volume (L) times molarity. So 0.025 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) times 0.05 M. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, but then we add another 20 cm³. So the diluted solution is 40 cm³. Let me correct that.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, as I thought earlier.

Now, when titrating this solution with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of NaOH at equivalence = 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. So for each of these points, I need to calculate the pH.

First, let's find the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume. Since the
