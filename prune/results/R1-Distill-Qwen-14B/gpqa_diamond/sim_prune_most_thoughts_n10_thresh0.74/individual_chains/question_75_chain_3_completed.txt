Okay, so I've got this question here about molecular biology and gene expression. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they checked, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. They looked at the construct's plus strand sequence and noticed something's wrong.

So the options are A to D. I need to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed.

First, what's GADD45G? I remember it's a protein involved in response to DNA damage, maybe cell cycle arrest. But the question is about the construct they made.

They added the HA (hemagglutinin) epitope at the N-terminus. HA is often used as a tag to detect the protein, so maybe the construct is supposed to produce a fusion protein with HA.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to see if there's an issue that would prevent proper translation or expression.

Hmm, the plasmid is in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells are common for expressing proteins because they can handle mammalian expression systems.

So what could go wrong? Let's look at the possible options.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If there's a mutation in the HA epitope, the protein might not be recognized by antibodies, making detection difficult. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. So maybe not this one. Unless the mutation prevents proper folding or function, but the primary issue is expression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the coding sequence has a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) introduced, the ribosome would stop there. Let me check the DNA sequence for any stop codons.

Looking at the sequence, I can scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA in triplets. Let's see: the sequence is given as 5' to 3', which is the coding strand. So each codon is read as 5' to 3' in triplets.

I'll scan the sequence:

Looking through the sequence, I don't immediately see any TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets. Wait, maybe I should look for possible stop codons.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then TAC is tyrosine, but wait, in the mRNA, TAC would code for tyrosine. But wait, the plasmid is constructed with the HA sequence, so maybe the start is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the end of the sequence. Let me find the end. The sequence ends with ...ATCCTGCTGCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

Wait, the last part before the end is ...GAGTGA. That's in the DNA plus strand.

Wait, looking at the last few triplets: let's see. The last part is ...CGAGTGA. So, the last few codons are CGA G T GA? Wait, let me break it down.

Wait, the sequence is written as 5' to 3', so the last part is 5' ...CGAGTGA 3'. So when transcribed into mRNA, the mRNA would be complementary to this. So the mRNA would have the sequence ...CGAGTGA in the 3' to 5' direction. Wait, no, wait: DNA is double stranded. The plus strand is the same as mRNA. So the construct's plus strand is coding, same as mRNA.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the plasmid, the coding sequence is the same as the mRNA. So the plus strand of the plasmid is the same as the mRNA. So the plasmid's coding sequence starts with ATG and ends with a stop codon.

Looking at the end of the provided sequence, the last part is ...CGAGTGA. So the last codon would be TGA. Because each codon is read as three bases.

Let me see: the last part is CGAGTGA, which is 6 bases. Wait, perhaps I should look at the last few codons.

Wait, let me count from the end backwards in triplets. So the last 12 bases would be: CGAGTGA3' (wait, the end is '...GAGTGA3').

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for any occurrence of TGA in the DNA sequence, because that would code for a stop in mRNA.

Looking through the sequence: I'll go through looking for TGA in the DNA, which would correspond to TGA in mRNA, a stop codon.

Looking at the DNA sequence, searching for TGA:

Looking... Hmm, let's see. The sequence has 'TACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Wait, I see a 'TGA' here. Let me see: looking through the string, I see 'TGA' in the middle.

Wait, let me index the positions. Let me make sure. The sequence is a long string, so perhaps I should look for 'TGA' as part of the triplet.

Wait, looking for TGA in the DNA, which would be present as T G A in the sequence.

Looking again: Let me look for any 'TGA' in the sequence. Hmm. I see 'GATTACG', so 'TAC' is present, but not TGA.

Wait, another spot: the sequence includes 'GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGT...'. Oh wait, there's 'TGA' here. Let me check:

In this part: ...GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGT... So 'TGA' is in 'TGA' at the end of 'GCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGT...'

Wait, it's in 'TGAACGT' â€” the TGA is the first three bases of that part. So the DNA has a TGA codon. So in the mRNA, that would be TGA, which is a stop codon. So that would cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, but wait: the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is the same as the plus strand. So TGA in the DNA would be TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Ah, so the construct includes a TGA codon, which would cause the ribosome to stop there, leading to a truncated protein. So that's a problem.

In this case, the HA epitope is at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if a stop codon occurs early, the ribosome would terminate, and the protein would be truncated, possibly not functional or detectable.

So looking back at the options, Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be due to a premature stop codon in the construct. So that's a possible reason.

Wait, but why would the construct have a TGA? Because the original gene might not have a TGA, so maybe during cloning, a mutation or unintended stop was introduced.

Wait, the HA sequence is added at the N-terminus. So the construct would have HA followed by GADD45G. So the stop codon would come after the entire sequence. But if there's a TGA in the middle, that would cause a premature stop.

In the given DNA sequence, I see a TGA in the middle, which would result in a premature stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein, which might not be detected, leading to the inability to overexpress the protein.

So the problem is the presence of TGA, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to early termination of translation.

So option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Other options: Option C says the linker is missing, causing proteolysis. But the presence of a stop codon would prevent the protein from being made correctly in the first place, so proteolysis wouldn't be the issue here. Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon, so the mRNA would have TAA, which is a stop codon in DNA. But in the construct, the TGA is present, which is a stop codon in mRNA, so that's the issue.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein is not working as expected. The construct includes a coding sequence for GADD45G with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N-terminus. Upon analyzing the provided DNA sequence, a premature stop codon (TGA) was identified in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated protein that is not functional or detectable. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA sequence would affect detection or function but does not explain the lack of overexpression. The issue is not with detection but with the protein being produced at all.
- **Option B:** The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the DNA sequence leads to early ribosome termination, preventing full-length protein synthesis. This matches the observed problem of failed overexpression.
- **Option C:** The absence of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would occur after translation, not prevent the protein from being synthesized in the first place. The premature stop codon is the primary issue here.
- **Option D:** The lack of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant because the sequence contains a TGA codon, which is a stop codon in mRNA, not UAA.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as the premature stop codon in the construct prevents full-length protein synthesis, explaining the lack of overexpression.

Answer: B
