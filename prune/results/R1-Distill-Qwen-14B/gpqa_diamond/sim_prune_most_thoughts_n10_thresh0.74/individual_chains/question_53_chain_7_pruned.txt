Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are A to D with different molecular formulas. 

First, let's parse the information given. The compound has an ester group because the FTIR shows absorption peaks for it. Esters typically show strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl group. 

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals:

1. Two signals for aromatic H. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents would be in positions that cause two different environments for the ring Hs. For example, para-substituted would have two sets of equivalent Hs (each pair across from each other), but wait, actually, in para substitution, all the Hs are equivalent if the substituents are the same, but if the substituents are different, like two different groups, then the ring would have two distinct sets of Hs. Wait, but the compound is di-substituted, meaning two substituents on the ring. So, the substituents could be in positions like para, meta, or ortho. 

If the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic Hs would be in two sets: two sets of equivalent Hs across the ring. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, perhaps the Hs would be in more complex splitting. Or maybe it's a 1,2 substitution (ortho), which would cause more splitting. Hmm, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals, so perhaps the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs (like in para-xylene, which has two sets of Hs each as doublets). Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that create two distinct environments, like if they're identical substituents in para, the aromatic Hs would be two doublets or something. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Next, two signals for vinyl H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to double bonds, so maybe the ester group is part of a substituted ethyl group. Ester groups usually have a structure like R-O-CO-R', where the R and R' can have different substituents. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent on the benzene ring. 

The two vinyl H signals suggest maybe two different sets of vinyl Hs. Wait, but how does that fit into the structure? Ester groups don't have vinyl Hs themselves. Oh wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ester connected to a vinyl group, like maybe a substituted allyl ester or something else with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is an allyl group attached via the ester.

Wait, another way: perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyloxy group attached to a vinyl group. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, considering that the NMR has two vinyl H signals. Let's think about a possible structure. Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester, and the other is perhaps another group that includes a vinyl group. Or maybe one substituent is the ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached in such a way that gives two different vinyl Hs.

Wait, another thought. The ester group has the structure R-O-CO-R'. So if one substituent is the ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2?), but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, which would have vinyl protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. So, for example, if the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2- something, but that might not have vinyl protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-O, but that's an ether, not a vinyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CR2, where R includes a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the NMR, the two
