Okay, so I have this astronomy question about detecting quasars using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, but when it's absorbed by hydrogen, it creates these absorption lines. The question mentions the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. 

Wait, Lyman alpha is the series in hydrogen where n=1 transitions to n=2, right? So the rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But the quasars are at high redshifts, which means their light gets redshifted. 

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that these clouds can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, because if the redshift is too high, the absorbed light might shift into a wavelength that's not observable from the ground. 

Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths much beyond the visible spectrum. Visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So, the Lyman alpha absorption line, which is 1216 Angstroms, when redshifted, must fall into the optical range for us to detect it. 

So, the rest wavelength is λ_rest = 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength λ_obs must be ≤ 7000 Angstroms because that's the upper limit for optical. 

The formula for redshift is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So rearranging for z: z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1. 

We want the minimal redshift where λ_obs is just at 7000 Angstroms. So plugging in, z = (7000 / 1216) -1. Let me calculate that. 

7000 divided by 1216 is approximately 5.758. So subtract 1 gives z ≈ 4.758. But wait, wait, that would mean a redshift of about 4.75. But none of the options are that high. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. 

Wait, maybe I confused the rest wavelength with something else. Oh wait, no, Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. Let me double-check the math. 1216 * (1+z) = 7000. So 1+z = 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.758. So z ≈ 4.758. But that's higher than any of the options. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the question is about the quasar's light being absorbed by the hydrogen. So the quasar's emitted light is at higher wavelengths? No, quasars emit across the spectrum, but the hydrogen's absorption is in the quasar's light. So the quasar's light is redshifted, and the hydrogen in the clouds absorbs the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha photons. 

Wait, no, let me think again. The
