Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about cosmology. The question involves a quasar observed with certain spectral features, and I need to find the comoving distance from Earth based on the given cosmological parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

First, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, when we observe the spectrum of a distant object, like a quasar, if there's a peak at a longer wavelength, that might indicate redshift due to the expansion of the universe. Because if the quasar emits light at a certain wavelength and we see it redshifted, the peak would be shifted longer. So the emission line could be, say, the Lyman-alpha line or something else. Let me think: Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that would suggest a redshift z where 121*(1+z) = 790. Let me calculate that. So 1+z = 790/121 ≈ 6.5289. So z ≈ 5.5289. That's a high redshift, which means the quasar is very far away.

Now, the next part is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is related to the redshift z under the cosmological model given. The parameters are Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m = 0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda = 0.7, and the universe is flat (Omega_total = 1).

I remember the formula for comoving distance involves integrating from 0 to z, something like D_C = c/H0 * ∫ dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, no, E(z) is the square root of (Ωm(1+z)^3 + Ωλ(1+z)^0) + any other terms, but since it's flat and no other components, it's just those two. So E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωk*(1+z)^2 + Ω_lambda), but since the universe is flat, Ωk = 0, so E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7).

So the comoving distance D_C = (c / H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(z')] dz'. But integrating this exactly is complicated. So we need an approximation or a formula for D_C in a flat ΛCDM model.

Wait, I think there's an approximate formula or maybe I can use a look-up table or some standard values. Alternatively, maybe I can use the relation between redshift and luminosity distance, but wait, the question asks for comoving distance, which is related to the proper distance at the time of emission (so a=1) scaled by the expansion.

Wait, no, comoving distance is the distance in the universe's geometry, which is related to the line of sight integral. So I have to compute that integral.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator or approximate method. Let me think: for a given z, D_C is approximately (c* (1 + z) ) / H0 * ... Wait, no, that's not quite it. Wait, for high z, when matter dominates, the integral behaves differently than when dark energy dominates.

But z is about 5.5 here, which is a high redshift. At z=5.5, the universe was matter-dominated, because matter density scales as (1+z)^3, and dark energy as (1+z)^0. So Omega_m (z) = (0.3)*(1+z)^3 / E^2, where E^2 = 0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7. At z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5, so (1+z)^3 = 274.625. So Omega_m(z) = 0.3 * 274.625 / (0.3*274.625 + 0.7) ). Let's compute that:

0.3 * 274.625 = 82.3875. So denominator is 82.3875 + 0.7 = 83.0875. So Omega_m(z) = 82.3875 / 83.0875 ≈ 0.9917. So it's almost 1, meaning matter dominates at that redshift. Therefore, the integral can perhaps be approximated using the matter-only case, but with a slight correction.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to look for an approximate formula or use a table of comoving distances. I think for a flat universe with Omega_m and Omega_lambda, there's an approximation or perhaps an online calculator, but since I can't look that up, I need to think of how to approximate this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z around 5-6, the comoving distance is about 10-12 billion parsecs. Wait, but the options here are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. Hmm, so maybe around 7 Gpc? Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the Hubble distance is c/H0. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. c is about 3e5 km/s. So H0 = 70 / (3e5) Mpc^-1 → H0 = 70/(3e5) s^-1. So c/H0 is (3e5) / (70/(3e5)) ) Mpc. Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it properly.

c = 3e5 km/s.

H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.

So c / H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5 /70) Mpc. 3e5 is 300,000. 300000 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc = 4.2857 Gpc. So the Hubble distance is about 4.2857 Gpc.

Now, the comoving distance for a given z is (c/H0) times the integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z').

So for high z, the integrand 1/E(z') can be approximated. Let me consider the integral when E(z') is dominated by matter.

In a matter-only universe (Omega_m=1, Omega_lambda=0), the integral from 0 to z of dz' / sqrt( (1+z')^3 ) ) = integral from 0 to z of dz' / ( (1+z')^(3/2) ) )

Which is ∫ (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = 2 (1+z')^(-1/2) ) from 0 to z.

So that gives 2 (1/(sqrt(1+z)) - 1), which is 2 (1 / sqrt(1+z) -1 )

So the integral would be 2 (1/sqrt(1+z) -1 )

But in our case, the universe isn't matter-only; it has dark energy. So the integral would be a bit different. But since at z=5.5, matter dominates, the integral should be close to that of a matter-dominated universe, perhaps a bit less.

So the integral I = ∫0^z dz' / E(z') ≈ ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7 )

But E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7 )

At high z, 0.3*(1+z)^3 dominates, so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2) )^(1/2). Wait, wait. Wait, 0.3*(1+z)^3 = 0.3 * (1+z)^3. So E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). For high z, this is approximately sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 ), so E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2 * 1/2) ? Wait, no, sqrt(a^3) is a^(3/2). So E(z) ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2) )

So 1/E(z) ≈ 1/( sqrt(0.3) (1+z)^(3/2) ) )

Then the integral I ≈ ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)) ) ] dz' 

= 1/sqrt(0.3) ∫0^z (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

Which is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ 2/(1+z)^0.5 - 2 ] 

Because the integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is 2/(1+z')^(1/2) ) + C.

So plugging in our z=5.5, 1+z=6.5. So:

I ≈ (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [2/sqrt(6.5) - 2 ]

Compute that:

sqrt(6.5) is about 2.55. So 2/2.55 ≈ 0.7843. 0.7843 - 2 = -1.2157. Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3) which is about 1.826. So 1.826 * (-1.2157) ≈ -2.217? Wait, that can't be right. Because integration from 0 to z should give a positive value. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in signs.

Wait, the integral is 2/(sqrt(1+z)) - 2/(sqrt(1+0)) ) = 2/sqrt(1+z) - 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So,

I ≈ (1/sqrt(0.3)) * (2/sqrt(6.5) - 2 )

Compute 2/sqrt(6.5): sqrt(6.5)=2.5495 → 2/2.5495 ≈ 0.7843.

So 0.7843 - 2 = -1.2157.

Wait, but that gives a negative value. But the integral must be positive. Hmm, I must have messed up the approximation.

Wait, no. Because when the integral is from 0 to z, the result is 2/(sqrt(1+z)) - 2. For z=5.5, 1+z=6.5, so sqrt(6.5)= ~2.55. So 2/2.55 is 0.7843. 0.7843-2 = -1.2157. But that's negative. Which can't be correct because the integral must be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I should have considered the approximation differently. Maybe in regions where dark energy isn't dominant, but wait, in reality, even at high z, dark energy has some influence.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use an approximate formula or use the lookback time approach, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can use a different approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, I can use the approximation for comoving distance. Let me think. I recall that the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C = (c / H0) * f(z)

where f(z) is a function that depends on z and the cosmological parameters.

I think for the standard Lambda-CDM model, there are tables or approximate expressions for f(z), but I don't remember the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion or some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the scale factor a is 1/(1+z). So at z=5.5, a ≈ 0.1538.

The comoving distance is given by:

D_C = a * ∫_a^1 (c / a') * (da' / H0 a' √(Ωm a'^-3 + Ωλ a'^0 )) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, another formula I recall is:

D_C = (c/H0) ∫_0^z dz' / E(z')

where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3 + Ωλ )

So, yes, that's the formula I need to use.

So, for z=5.5, E(z) = sqrt( 0.3*(1+5.5)^3 + 0.7 )

Compute (1+5.5) =6.5. (6.5)^3 = 274.625. Multiply by 0.3 → 82.3875. Add 0.7 → 83.0875. So E(z)=sqrt(83.0875)≈9.115.

So E(z)=9.115.

But wait, when integrating, E(z') varies with z', so I can't just take E(z=5.5) for the entire integral. I have to integrate from 0 to 5.5.

Hmm, but integrating this analytically is tough. Maybe I should approximate it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that at high z, the integral is dominated by the matter term, so E(z') ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2) )

So 1/E(z') ≈ 1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2) )

Then, the integral I = ∫0^5.5 [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2) ) ] dz'

Which is (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫0^5.5 (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

As earlier.

So that integral is (1/sqrt(0.3)) * [ 2/(1+z')^(½) ) ] from 0 to 5.5.

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ 2/sqrt(6.5) - 2/sqrt(1) ]

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ 2/(2.55) - 2 ]

= (1/ approx 0.5477) [ 0.7843 - 2 ]

= (1.826) [ -1.2157 ]

Wait, that's giving a negative value, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the approximation isn't valid in this case. Because as z gets large, the integral would approach the matter-dominated case, but perhaps with the dark energy, the integral is a bit smaller than the matter-only case. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a better approximation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the approximation for D_C when matter and dark energy are both present.

Wait, I think I remember that for the standard cosmology (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance for a given z can be found using certain approximations or look-up tables. But since I can't look it up, perhaps I can recall some approximate values.

For example, at z=1, D_C is roughly 2 Gpc. Wait, no, I think it's higher. Alternatively, I think that at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 billion light-years, but I'm mixing units.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance for z=1 in a flat Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, is approximately 2 Gpc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps I can use the formula for D_C in terms of the scale factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the age of the universe approach, but that might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the comoving distance is proportional to the integral of 1/E(z') from 0 to z. So I can compute it numerically by breaking the integral into several parts.

Let me approximate the integral ∫0^5.5 dz' / E(z') using a few steps. Since it's tricky to do exactly, perhaps I can split the integral into regions where matter and dark energy dominate.

At high z, matter dominates, so E(z') ≈ sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2). For lower z', dark energy becomes more important.

But for z=5.5, even at z=2, (1+z)=3. (3)^3=27 * 0.3 =8.1. 8.1 +0.7=8.8. So E(z)=sqrt(8.8)=~2.966.

Wait, but for z=5.5, E(z) is about 9.115.

Hmm, perhaps I can break the integral from 0 to 5.5 into intervals where E(z') is approximately dominated by matter or dark energy.

Alternatively, perhaps using Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule for approximation.

But to do that, I need to compute E(z) at several points.

Let me try a few sample points:

z=0: E= sqrt(0 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.7) ≈0.83666.

z=1: E= sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*8 +0.7)=sqrt(2.4 +0.7)=sqrt(3.1)=1.76068.

z=2: E= sqrt(0.3*(3)^3 +0.7)=sqrt(0.3*27 +0.7)=sqrt(8.1 +0.7)=sqrt(8.8)=2.966.

z=3: (4^3)=64*0.3=19.2 +0.7=19.9 → E= ~4.461.

z=4: (5^3)=125 *0.3=37.5 +0.7=38.2 → E= sqrt(38.2)=6.18.

z=5: (6^3)=216 *0.3=64.8 +0.7=65.5 → E= sqrt(65.5)=8.09.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625 *0.3=82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 → E≈9.115.

So using these points, I can maybe approximate the integral ∫0^5.5 [1/E(z') ] dz' using the trapezoidal rule with intervals at z=0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5.

Each interval's width is 1, except between 5 to 5.5, which has 0.5.

The function f(z) = 1/E(z) is:

z: 0 1 2 3 4 5 5.5

f(z): 1/0.83666 ≈1.195, 1/1.76068≈0.568, 1/2.966≈0.337, 1/4.461≈0.224, 1/6.18≈0.162, 1/8.09≈0.1237, 1/9.115≈0.1097.

Now, apply the trapezoidal rule.

The trapezoidal rule for each interval [a, b] is (b-a)/2 [f(a) + f(b)].

Let's compute the integral in parts.

From 0 to1:

Δz=1. Contribution: 1/2 [1.195 + 0.568] = 0.5 * 1.763 = 0.8815.

From 1 to2:

Δz=1. Contribution: 0.5*(0.568 + 0.337 ) = 0.5*(0.905)=0.4525.

From 2 to3:

Δz=1. Contribution: 0.5*(0.337 +0.224)=0.5*(0.561)=0.2805.

From3 to4:

Δz=1. Contribution: 0.5*(0.224 +0.162)=0.5*(0.386)=0.193.

From4 to5:

Δz=1. Contribution: 0.5*(0.162 +0.1237)=0.5*(0.2857)=0.14285.

From5 to5.5:

Δz=0.5. Contribution:0.25*(0.1237 +0.1097)=0.25*(0.2334)=0.05835.

Now, sum all these contributions:

0.8815 + 0.4525 = 1.334

+0.2805 →1.6145

+0.193 →1.8075

+0.14285 →1.95035

+0.05835 →2.0087.

So the integral I ≈ 2.0087.

Wait, but wait, this is an approximation using the trapezoidal rule with intervals of 1 and 0.5. It's not very precise, but gives us an estimate.

So D_C = (c/H0) * I.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

So c/H0 = (3e5) /70 Mpc = (3e5 /70 ) ≈4285.7 Mpc = 4.2857 Gpc.

Wait, so D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * I.

I is about 2.0087.

So D_C ≈4.2857 *2.0087 ≈8.62 Gpc.

But wait, that's higher than the options given. The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc. So 8.6 is close to 9 Gpc, but perhaps the approximation is off.

Wait, but the trapezoidal rule with just 7 points may not be very accurate. Also, I only used 6 intervals, which is not enough for precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral I is around 2.0, leading to D_C≈8.5 Gpc.

But wait, the options are 6,7,8,9.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, another thought. The comoving distance can't be larger than the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light. Wait, the age of the universe at z=5.5 would be about (in a flat Lambda-CDM model) around 10 billion years? Wait, no, the age for high z is less. Wait, for the current Hubble parameter, the age is about 14 billion years. So for high z, the lookback time is significant. Let me think: the comoving distance can't be more than the age of the universe multiplied by c, but in this case, 8.6 Gpc is about 28 billion light years (since 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light years). Wait, no, 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years. So 8.6 Gpc is about 28 billion light-years. Wait, but the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, so the maximum possible comoving distance would be c multiplied by the age, which is 13.8e9 years * (3e5 km/s) → but in terms of Gpc, I think that's 13.8e9 years * 3e5 km/s / (3.15e7 s/year) ) / (1e6 Mpc/Gpc) )

Wait, let me compute that: c=3e5 km/s.

One year is about 3.15e7 seconds.

So distance per year: 3e5 * 3.15e7 = 9.45e12 km/year.

One Gpc is about 3.086e19 km. So 9.45e12 km/year → 9.45e12 / 3.086e19 ≈ 3.06e-7 Gpc/year.

Multiply by 13.8e9 years: 3.06e-7 *13.8e9 ≈ 421.08 Gpc. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no, because the Hubble distance is about 4.28 Gpc, so the age is Hubble time t=1/H0 ≈14e9 years.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that the maximum comoving distance is about c multiplied by the age of the universe. But given that, the comoving distance at high z would be a large number, but in our case, z=5.5 is manageable.

But back to the problem. The approximation using the trapezoidal rule gave D_C ≈8.6 Gpc. However, the options given are up to 9 Gpc. So the closest option is C) 9 Gpc.

But wait, maybe I should check if a more accurate integration would give a value closer to 7 Gpc.

Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: for a given redshift z, the comoving distance can be found using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z dz' / E(z').

Given that, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for D_C in terms of the scale factor. But without precise tables or code, it's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation where the integral I is about 2.0, which gives D_C≈8.5 Gpc. Since the options are 6,7,8,9, and 8.5 is close to 9, but in the options, 9 is option C, and 7 is D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration, and the integral is actually around 1.8, leading to 7.7 Gpc, which would round to 8 Gpc (option B). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should cross-check with the Hubble distance. Hubble distance is c/H0 ≈4.28 Gpc. So if the integral I is about 1.8, then D_C is about 7.7 Gpc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use an online calculator or look for a table.

Wait, I found a source that says that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance D_C for z=5 is about 5.0 Gpc. But wait, that doesn't match the options. Or perhaps I'm mixing up with other parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance from the book "Cosmology in a Nutshell" by Peacock, but I don't have the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: the comoving distance can be expressed using the inverse Hubble parameter and the integral. So perhaps, for a universe dominated by matter, the comoving distance is about (c/H0) * 2/sqrt(0.3) * (1/(1+z)^(1/2) -1), but that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate relation from the scale factor. At high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so D_C ≈ (c/H0) * 2 (sqrt(1+z) -1 ) / sqrt(0.3) )

Wait, let me compute that:

sqrt(6.5)=2.55. So 2*(2.55 -1)=3.1. Then divide by sqrt(0.3)= approx 0.5477. So 3.1 /0.5477≈5.65. Multiply by (c/H0)=4.2857 Gpc: 5.65 *4.2857 ≈24.2 Gpc. That's way too high, which doesn't make sense. So that approach must be wrong.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the lookback time formula, and then relate it to the proper distance. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=5, the comoving distance is about 12 Gpc, but that's probably in a different cosmology. Wait, no, in our case, with H0=70, it's lower.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is around 8 Gpc, which is option B or D.

Wait, the options are:

A)6 Gpc

B)8 Gpc

C)9 Gpc

D)7 Gpc

Hmm. Based on the rough integration I did earlier, using the trapezoidal rule, I got about 8.6 Gpc, which is close to 9 Gpc (option C). But my approximation might have overestimated because the trapezoidal rule with only 7 points is not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8 Gpc.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm is not necessarily the Lyman-alpha line. Maybe it's another emission line. For example, the Balmer series in hydrogen. The Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790, that would be a redshift of (790/656)= ~1.204. So z≈0.204. That's a much lower redshift. But that doesn't match with the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths. Wait, because if the emission line is at around 656 nm, and it's observed at 790, then the other lines would be even longer. But in that case, the flux wouldn't drop off significantly below 790 nm, because emission lines would be at longer wavelengths.

But wait, the question says that the flux drops significantly at wavelengths <790 nm. So that suggests that the peak is at 790, and there's no flux below it. That would imply that the peak is the Lyman limit, perhaps. Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, which is in the UV. So if the emission line is the Lyman limit, observed at 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z= (790/91) -1 ≈8.789 -1=7.789. That's a much higher redshift than before.

So then, z=7.789.

Wait, that's a much higher z, which would make the comoving distance much larger.

Wait, but that's a different approach. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming the peak is Lyman-alpha. If the peak is at 790 nm and the flux drops below that, perhaps it's the Lyman limit. Let me recalculate.

If the emission line is the Lyman limit at 91 nm, observed at 790 nm, then z= (790/91) -1 ≈8.68 -1=7.68.

So z=7.68.

Now, the comoving distance for z=7.68. Using the same approach as before.

Compute E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+7.68)^3 +0.7 )

1+7.68=8.68. (8.68)^3 ≈ 8.68 *8.68=75.34, *8.68 ≈652.7.

0.3*652.7≈195.8. 195.8 +0.7=196.5. E(z)=sqrt(196.5)=14.02.

But again, the integral from 0 to 7.68 is needed.

Hmm, this complicates things. But given the options, perhaps the correct approach is to go with the initial assumption of z=5.5, leading to a comoving distance around 8-9 Gpc.

But I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe looking for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the peak is the Lyman series or another series. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman series. For example, Lyman beta is about 103 nm. Observed at 790 nm, that's z= (790/103) -1 ≈7.669 -1=6.669. So z≈6.67.

Hmm, that's even higher.

But I think perhaps the initial approach was correct with z=5.5, leading to D_C≈8.6 Gpc, so the closest option is C)9 Gpc.

Wait, but the options don't have 8.6. The options are 6,7,8,9.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)7 Gpc, but based on the initial integration, I thought around 8.6.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Hubble constant. With H0=70, the Hubble distance is about 4.2857 Gpc.

If the integral I is around 2, then D_C is about 8.57 Gpc, which is approx 8.6, close to 9. But the options don't have 8.5, but 8 and 9. So perhaps the correct answer is C)9 Gpc.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: perhaps the comoving distance can be found with the formula D_C = (c / H0) * (1 + (1 + q0)/2 z + ... ), but that's the Taylor expansion for low z, which isn't applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for D_C in a flat universe:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ )

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for high z, the comoving distance is dominated by the matter term, leading to D_C ≈ (c/H0) * 2 * [ sqrt(1+z) -1 ] / sqrt(Ωm )

So for z=5.5, sqrt(1+5.5)=sqrt(6.5)=2.55.

So 2*(2.55-1) =3.1. Divide by sqrt(0.3)=0.5477. 3.1/0.5477 ≈5.65. Multiply by (c/H0)=4.2857 Gpc: 5.65 *4.2857≈24.2 Gpc. That's way too high.

Wait, that can't be right. So that approach must be flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the approximation that D_C is proportional to (1 + (1 + q0)/2 z) where q0 is the deceleration parameter. q0=0.5(Ωm - 2Ω_lambda). Since Ωm=0.3 and Ω_lambda=0.7,

q0=0.5*(0.3 - 2*0.7 )=0.5*(0.3-1.4)=0.5*(-1.1)= -0.55.

So D_C ≈ (c/H0) [1 + (1-0.55)/2 *z ] = (c/H0) [1 + 0.225 z ]

So for z=5.5, this gives 1 + 0.225*5.5 =1 +1.2375=2.2375.

Multiply by (c/H0)=4.2857 Gpc: 4.2857 *2.2375 ≈9.59 Gpc. Close to 10 Gpc, but none of the options are that high. The highest is 9 Gpc.

Wait, but this is an approximation valid for low z, as I'm using the Taylor expansion. So perhaps this isn't accurate for z=5.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 7 Gpc, option D.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I spent, I'll make a choice based on the initial integration which suggested around 8.6 Gpc, so the closest option is C)9 Gpc. But another part of me thinks that perhaps the correct answer is B)8 Gpc, as it's a more conservative estimate.


To determine the comoving distance \( D_C \) of the quasar from Earth, we analyze the given data and cosmological parameters. The quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm, with flux dropping significantly at wavelengths shorter than this. This suggests a redshift \( z \), as the observed wavelength is stretched due to the universe's expansion. Assuming the peak corresponds to the Lyman-alpha transition (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121 \, \text{nm} \)), the redshift is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121} - 1 \approx 5.5289.
\]

With \( z \approx 5.5 \), we use the cosmological parameters: \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \), and a flat universe (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)). The comoving distance is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')},
\]

where \( E(z') = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda} \). For \( z = 5.5 \), \( E(z') \) is dominated by the matter term at high redshifts, but dark energy becomes significant at lower redshifts. The integral is challenging to compute analytically, so numerical approximations or look-up tables are typically used.

Using the trapezoidal rule with sample points for \( E(z') \) at \( z = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5 \), the integral \( \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')} \) is approximated. The result is combined with \( c/H_0 \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), giving:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \, \text{Mpc} \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

After performing the integration and approximations, the comoving distance \( D_C \) is estimated to be around \( 8.6 \, \text{Gpc} \). Comparing this to the options provided:

- **A) 6 Gpc**: Too low compared to the estimated value.
- **B) 8 Gpc**: Close but slightly lower than the approximation.
- **C) 9 Gpc**: Closest to the estimated value of \( 8.6 \, \text{Gpc} \).
- **D) 7 Gpc**: Significantly lower than the approximation.

Given the approximations and the available options, the best match is **C) 9 Gpc**.
