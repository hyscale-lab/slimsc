Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, but I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So that sounds like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Or is it N ∝ plx^5? Wait, no, the way it's phrased, "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5" implies that N is proportional to 1 divided by plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. Or maybe N is proportional to plx^−5.

Wait, let me make sure. If a quantity varies as 1 over something, that's inverse proportionality. So if something varies as 1/(x^2), that's inverse square. So here, number of stars N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So N is inversely proportional to plx^5.

Parallax, plx, is related to distance. I remember that parallax is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1 / plx.

So if I can express N in terms of distance, that's what the question is after. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I think they're asking for the relation between N and d.

Let me write down the relationship again. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 ) = d^5.

Wait, let me check. If plx =1/d, then 1/plx =d. So 1/(plx)^5 = (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, that suggests that as d increases, N increases rapidly. But wait, that doesn't make sense because usually, the number of stars you can observe decreases with distance because they
