Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, wait. I think I might be misreading the compound. 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe that's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or perhaps it's o-bromodimethylaminobenzene? Hmm. Wait, maybe the 'd' is part of the substituent. Oh, wait, sometimes when they write things like -d, it might refer to a deuterium, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Because 'd' alone doesn't make much sense in that context. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' stands for something else, maybe a substituent like a methyl group? Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the assumption that the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: a bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2.

So, the structure is a benzene ring where positions 1 and 2 are bromo and N(CH3)2 respectively. Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Wait,
