Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

Wait, the setup says both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames don't accelerate, so no acceleration here. That probably means we can use special relativity, but wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction but not extreme. So relativity effects might matter, but maybe this is a classical mechanics problem because the options are just numbers without mentioning relativity.

Wait, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the speed is 6e4 km/s.

But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so time is different in each frame. Because of time dilation. So we can't just multiply speed by time; we have to account for the time difference between the frames.

Wait, so in the ejecta's
