Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR shows some peaks that are unexpected. Specifically, there are two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. Wait, same alpha-proton? So same proton but two peaks instead of one. Hmm. 

The peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each is about 0.5H? But wait, that might not be exactly right. Wait, it says the integrals are roughly equal and together sum to 1H. So each is about half a proton. That suggests that each peak is integrating to 0.5H, meaning the same proton is split into two, but that would usually be due to coupling. But the question says that based on the coupling pattern, spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Oh, so it's not like a doublet because of splitting by another proton. So what else could cause the same proton to split into two peaks?

Wait, maybe it's not splitting. Because if it were splitting, the integration would still be the same for each peak, but the areas would sum to the same. But the peaks are separate. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a mixture of isomers that have the same environment for that alpha proton but different in another way.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Another point is that the LC-MS analysis of the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So, the masses are the same. So it's not a different mass, like a byproduct.

Wait, if the masses are the same, then the compounds are either enantiomers or diastereomers. But the question says that the 1H NMR for the crude compound has these two peaks. Let me think about enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images. So if the compound is a
