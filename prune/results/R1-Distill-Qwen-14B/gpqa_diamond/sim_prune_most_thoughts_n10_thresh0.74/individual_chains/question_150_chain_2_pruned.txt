Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, maybe I should remember it as DoU = (2nC +2 - nH - nX + nN)/2. Here, nC=8, nH=9, nN=1, and assuming no X (like halogens) because the molecular formula doesn't show any. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring plus double bonds or something. 

Looking at the NMR data: The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret this. 

9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That seems like a high ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's adjacent to another proton. Or perhaps it's a proton next to an electronegative group. 

The next peak at 6.98 is a doublet of 2H. That could be aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Similarly, 6.51 is also a doublet of 2H, which might be another set of aromatic protons. The 6.27 peak is broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like -OH protons, but wait, in NMR, OH protons are usually broad or sometimes not seen because they can be exchanging and appear as singlets. But wait, 6.27 is in the aromatic region, so maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system, like a vinyl group next to an oxygen. 

The 3.66 peak is a doublet of 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that. 

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring, maybe two rings since I see multiple aromatic signals. Let me think about the integration: 2H in each of the two aromatic regions, so maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. 

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets with 2H each. If each is a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps they are from two different benzene rings. Maybe each is a para-substituted benzene ring attached to something else. 

The 9.72 is the triplet 1H. If it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet because it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, wait, that makes sense. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think. Suppose we have a butenyl group attached to two benzene rings. 

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 could be the aldehyde proton. If it's adjacent to a CH2 group, then the aldehyde is at the end, and the next group is CH2. So like RCHO. Then the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde, so the aldehyde's proton would be next to the CH2, giving a triplet because the H on the CH2 would split it. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl. Wait, but the triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So if the aldehyde is CHO and it's next to a CH2, which has two protons, then the aldehyde proton would be split into a triplet. Because each of the two protons on CH2 would cause splitting into a doublet, but with two adjacent protons, it becomes a triplet. So that makes sense.

So the structure could be something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but wait, but the NMR also shows other aromatic signals. So perhaps two benzene rings connected via a chain. 

Looking at the integration, we have 2H each for the aromatic regions. Maybe it's a biphenyl structure, each with substituents. Let me try to draw this.

Suppose we have a central chain, perhaps something like CH2-CHO, with two benzene rings attached. For example, maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a butenyl group or something. 

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents and a conjugated system. Let me think again about the NMR. The 9.72 is a triplet, so maybe the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group which is attached to another CH2. 

Wait, the 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CHO. But then the 3.66 would be the OCH2. So perhaps the structure is OCH2CH2CHO with aromatic rings attached. But how many aromatic rings? The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count. If the aldehyde is CHO, the OCH2CH2 would be OCH2CH2CHO, which is OCH2CH2CHO, which is 5 carbons (O, 2 CH2, and CHO). Wait, the O is part of the formula, but the carbons would be 4 (OCH2CH2CHO is 3 carbons: O-C, CH2, CH2-CHO). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that includes an O. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cinnamaldehyde. Because cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but with substituents. 

Wait, let me count the carbons. If it's a diphenyl compound, with the central chain having four carbons, maybe. Let's say two benzene rings attached via a four-carbon chain. But the formula is C8
