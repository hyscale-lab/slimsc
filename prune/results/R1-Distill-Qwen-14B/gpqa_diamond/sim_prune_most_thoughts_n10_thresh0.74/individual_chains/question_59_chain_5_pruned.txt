Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me see. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, these are not just any acids and bases; some might be strong, others weak. Let's break it down.

First, I should figure out how much of each acid and base is present in terms of moles. Because when you mix them, the strong acid and strong base will react completely, and then the weak acid will react with any remaining base. Or maybe the other way around, depending on which is in excess.

So, the three solutions: CH3COOH is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because Ba is a group 2 metal and OH- is a strong base; so Ba(OH)2 dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions.

Let me calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH-. So the total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So now, let's think about the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 first because both are strong acid and base. The reaction is HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O. Wait, actually, more accurately, each HCl gives H+ and Cl-, and each Ba(OH)2 gives Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

The neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ from HCl are 0.08, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.18.

So, when you mix them, the OH- will react with H+ from HCl. Let me see: H+ = 0.08 moles, OH- = 0.18.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. Since OH- is in excess, after H+ is neutralized, the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. Because 0.08 H+ can only neutralize 0.08 OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial OH- is 0.18, and H+ is 0.08. So after reaction, the remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-. So the solution will be basic because there's excess OH-.

But wait, what about the acetic acid, CH3COOH? Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, and it can donate H+ ions. So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with any available H+ from the weak acid as well, right?

So, first, the strong acid HCl (0.08 moles H+) reacts with the strong base Ba(OH)2 (0.18 moles OH-). So, after that, we have 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, this OH- will react with the weak acid CH3COOH.

Wait, but how does that work? CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate. But in solution, it can donate H+ ions. So when OH- is present, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will react with the CH3COOH. The reaction is OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize a mole of CH3COOH by converting it into acetate.

So, initial mo
