Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis specifically is when two alkenes in the same molecule undergo a reaction to form a ring, right?

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that out. So, cyclohexene with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Then, at carbons 3 and 4, there are methyl groups. And at carbon 5, there's an isopropyl group. So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring, with substituents at positions 3,4,5.

Now, I need to figure out the starting material that would produce this via ring-closing metathesis. The options are all octadienes, so they must have two double bonds. The metathesis will break and reform the double bonds, connecting the ends to form the ring.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis typically uses a Grubbs catalyst or similar, which facilitates the breaking and reforming of the double bonds. The reaction usually involves two alkenes in a single molecule, which then cyclize to form a ring.

So the starting material probably has a diene structure where the two double bonds are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, they form the cyclohexene ring.

Let me think about the structure. The target has a six-membered ring, cyclohexene. So the starting material would have to have a chain that can cyclize to form six-membered ring with the substituents in the right positions.

Looking at the options, they're all octa dienes, meaning eight-carbon molecules with two double bonds. So each option is a diene with substituents.

So for ring-closing metathesis, the two double bonds should be positioned such that when the catalyst breaks and reforms them, the chain forms a six-membered ring. Let me visualize each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me correct that. The positions are 1 and 7, so the double bonds are at the ends. The molecule would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, that's nine carbons if I count right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, octa means eight carbons. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's think again. Octa-1,7-diene would have the first double bond between C1 and C2, and the second between C7 and C8. So the molecule is 8 carbons long with double bonds at positions 1,2 and 7,8.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. But wait, the substituents are at 3,4,5. Wait, the substituents are 5-isopropyl and 3,4-dimethyl. So, the structure would have substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the eight-carbon chain.

So, for option A: 3 and 4 have methyl groups, 5 has isopropyl. The double bonds are at 1 and 7. So when metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds and reconnect them to form a ring.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes would need to be positioned so that when they react, the ends come together. So each alkene would have to be connected through a chain that, upon cyclization, forms the six-membered ring with the substituents in the correct positions.

The target molecule has a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have a chain length such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, they form the ring. So, the distance between the two double bonds in the starting material must correspond to a six-membered ring.

Wait, the number of carbons between the two double bonds would determine the ring size. Let me think, the starting material is an octadiene, which is eight carbons. Suppose the two double bonds are separated by a certain number of carbons. When metathesis occurs, those are the ends that will connect.

Let me think about the positions. The target is cyclohexene, which is six carbons. So the starting material must have a chain of eight carbons with two double bonds. The two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7 (so in option A), but that's 1 and 7. So the distance between the two alkenes would be 6 carbons apart (since 7-1-1=5, but maybe I'm not counting correctly). Wait, maybe the distance is the number of single bonds between the two alkenes.

In the starting material, if the two alkenes are at positions 1 and 7, the distance between them would be (7 - 1 -1) =5. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the number of carbons between the two double bonds is (n) such that when the rings form, the ring size will be n+2 or something like that.

Wait, let's think about the general case. Suppose the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, say, at positions x and y. When they undergo ring-closing metathesis, the new double bonds would form between the ends, creating a ring.

The number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus 2 (since each double bond contributes a carbon to the new ring formation). So, for instance, if the two double bonds are separated by four single bonds (so five carbons in between, perhaps?), then the ring would be six-membered.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the ring size is (number of carbons between the double bonds) + 2. So if the ring is six-membered, that would require four carbons between the two double bonds.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose the starting material is a 1,5-diene. Then the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds (positions 1-2 and 5-6). The number of carbons between them is 3. So ring size would be 3 + 2 =5. So a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe it's the number of single bonds between the two alkenes that determine the ring size. So if the two alkenes are separated by four single bonds (so five carbons in total between them?), the ring would have 6 members.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the diene as a linear chain with two alkenes, and upon metathesis, the ends of the alkenes join to form a ring.

So, for the target cyclohexene, the ring is six carbons. Therefore, the starting material must have a chain such that when the two alkenes are connected, it forms a six-membered ring.

Let me imagine a chain: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. No, that's not right. Wait, the starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons with two double bonds.

Wait, if the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 6 (octa-1,6-diene), then the number of carbons between them is 4, because between C1 and C6, there are four carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5). So when metathesis occurs, the two alkenes would cross, and the ends would connect, which would form a six-membered ring. Because the chain between the two alkenes is four carbons, plus the two alkenes' carbons, making six.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the structure. Suppose the starting material is an octadiene, with the two double bonds at positions 1,2 and 6,7. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, that's nine carbons. No, wait, octa is eight, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's ten. Wait, maybe the formula is correct as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the starting material's chain length. The target is a six-membered ring. So the starting material must have a chain that, when two ends are connected, forms that ring.

But the starting materials are octadienes, which are eight carbons. Let me imagine the starting material as having two double bonds, and after metathesis, a six-membered ring is formed. That would require that the two double bonds are in positions that, when broken and the ends connected, form the ring.

Wait, another approach: The number of carbons in the ring is equal to the number of carbons in the starting material minus twice the number of alkenes plus the number of new bonds formed. Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, think about the positions of substituents. The target molecule has substituents at positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents must be present in the part that becomes the ring.

Wait, the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents must be in the parts of the chain that will become positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Therefore, the starting material's substituents must be located such that when the ring forms, those substituents end up in the correct positions.

So, for the starting material, the substituents (3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl) must be on the chain in such a way that their positions correspond to the positions in the ring.

Suppose the starting material is a diene where the substituents are in positions 3,4,5. Let me think about each option.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. Let's imagine the structure.

The molecule would be CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure would have double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. So the positions are:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: CH-

4: CH(CH2CH3)

5: CH(CH3)

6: CH2-

7: CH2-

8: CH2-

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me number the carbons:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

So for octa-2,6-diene, the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but wait, that's a ten-carbon chain, but it should be eight. Hmm, maybe I'm not counting correctly. Let me write it as:

Positions (1 to 8):

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, let me think of the substituents. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5. In the starting material, the substituent at position 5 is isopropyl, and 3 and 4 are methyl.

So during metathesis, the double bonds at positions 2 and 6 would break and recombine to form the ring. So, the two alkenes are at positions 2-3 and 6-7, in an eight-carbon chain.

When they undergo metathesis, the ends of these alkenes would connect. So the CH2=CH- part from position 2 would connect to the CH2-CH2=CH part from position 7? Not sure.

Alternatively, the Grubbs catalyst would cause the alkenes to break and swap ends. So the two alkenes are at positions 2 and 6. So the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 3,4,5). So when the metathesis happens, the two ends would form a ring, which would be 6-membered.

Wait, let me count. The chain between the two alkenes is positions 3,4,5. So three carbons. When the ends are connected, that would form a ring of 3 + 2 =5? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the ring would have 5 + 2 =7? No, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, the number of carbons between the two alkenes (excluding the double bonds) is 3. Then, when the catalyst connects the ends, the ring formed would have 3 + 2 =5 carbons. But the target is cyclohexene, which is six. So perhaps this isn't right.

Let me think again. The starting material is an octadiene, so eight carbons. Suppose the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 5. Then, the number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 2,3,4). So when the metathesis occurs, the ends would connect, making a five-membered ring (3 + 2). But the target is a six-membered ring, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material has the two double bonds in positions that are separated by four carbons. Then, the ring formed would be 4+2=6. So the two double bonds would be at positions 1 and 6 in an octadiene, which is eight carbons. So between them, there are four carbons. So during metathesis, those would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, positions 1: double bond, 2: end of first double bond.

Then, positions 3,4,5 have substituents.

Positions 6 and 7: second double bond.

So the chain here is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, but that's eight carbons. So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

1,2 double bond; 6,7 double bond.

So when metathesis occurs, the two double bonds break. The catalyst would swap the ends. So the end of the first double bond (C2) would connect to the end of the second double bond (C7), and the other ends (C1 and C6) would connect.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism is such that the Grubbs catalyst breaks each alkene into two parts and swaps the ends. So in this case, the two alkenes are at positions 1,2 and 6,7.

So, the first alkene is between C1 and C2. The second between C6 and C7.

When metathesis occurs, the ends would connect. So the end of C2 would connect to C7, and the end of C1 would connect to C6.

So the new ring would be formed by connecting C2 with C7, and C1 with C6.

Wait, but how does that form the ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the formation involves the ends of the alkenes being connected. So the two alkenes are at positions 1 and 6. So the distance between them is 4 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). So the ring formed would have 4 + 2 =6 members.

Yes! That makes sense. Because the two alkenes are four carbons apart, forming a six-membered ring.

So if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6 in an eight-carbon chain, the ring formed would have six members. And the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene ring, as required.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So that fits.

Let me quickly check the other options. Option A has double bonds at 1 and 7. So the distance between them is 5 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5,6), which would form a seven-membered ring. But the target is six, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B has double bonds at 2 and 6. The distance between them is 3 carbons (positions 3,4,5), leading to a five-membered ring. Not matching.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. Double bonds at 1 and7. Then, substituents at 4 (isopropyl) and 5,6 (methyl). The distance is 5 carbons, leading to a seven-membered ring. Not the target.

So the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the options provided. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments to form a ring. The target molecule is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. The starting material must be an octadiene with two double bonds positioned such that their recombination forms the six-membered ring.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   - Double bonds are at positions 1 and 7.  
   - The distance between the double bonds is 5 carbons (positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
   - This would result in a seven-membered ring, which does not match the target molecule.  

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   - Double bonds are at positions 2 and 6.  
   - The distance between the double bonds is 3 carbons (positions 3, 4, 5).  
   - This would result in a five-membered ring, which does not match the target molecule.  

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   - Double bonds are at positions 1 and 6.  
   - The distance between the double bonds is 4 carbons (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).  
   - This would result in a six-membered ring, which matches the target molecule.  
   - The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align with the substituents in the target molecule.  

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   - Double bonds are at positions 1 and 7.  
   - The distance between the double bonds is 5 carbons (positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
   - This would result in a seven-membered ring, which does not match the target molecule.  

### Conclusion:
Option C, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, is the correct starting material. The double bonds are positioned such that their recombination via ring-closing metathesis forms the six-membered cyclohexene ring with the correct substituents.
