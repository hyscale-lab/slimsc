Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. Trans would mean the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So the structure should be something like benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is a benzene ring attached to a CH₂CH₂CHO group, but wait, no. Let me get this right. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the aldehyde group is at the end of a double bond. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, wait. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound, specifically, it's (E)-3-phenylpropanal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? Wait, no. Wait, propanal is CH3CH2CHO. But cinnamaldehyde is an alpha, beta
