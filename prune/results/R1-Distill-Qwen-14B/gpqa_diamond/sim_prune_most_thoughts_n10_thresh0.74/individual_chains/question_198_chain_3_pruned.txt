Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... Oh, I remember that dithiocyanato would be the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex. But wait, the question mentions "dithiocyanato" as a complex. So the species we're interested in is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is it [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no. The problem says "blue dithiocyanato", which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)2]^(n) complex. Alternatively, the term "dithiocyanato" might mean two SCN ligands. But I might need to get that straight.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1 to β4. Stability constants, or formation constants, usually tell us the tendency of a complex to form. Each β represents the formation constant for a specific complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^{2-}. Wait, wait, because each SCN- is a -1 charge. So Co^2+ plus n SCN-: the overall charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n. So for n=1: Co(SCN) → charge is +1 → so β1 is for [CoSCN]^+.

n=2: charge is 0? So [Co(SCN)₂]^0. That would have β2=40.

n=3: charge is -1 → β3=63.

n=4: charge is -2
