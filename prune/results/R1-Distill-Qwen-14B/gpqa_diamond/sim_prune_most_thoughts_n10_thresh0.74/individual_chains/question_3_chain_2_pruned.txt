Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that expectation values involve taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying by the operator, and then the state again. Oh right, the formula is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Since expectation is linear, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately.

First, let me find the expectation value of σz. The state is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz. That makes it easier because the expectation value for σz is just the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue for each state. 

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1).

Calculating |0.5|² is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|² is (3/4), which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me double-check the normalization. 0.5 squared is 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So 0.25 + 0.75 is 1. So the
