Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a supernova occurred, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the problem is about relative motion between two frames. I remember something about time dilation and length contraction from special relativity, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. Let me think.

In the problem, it says both frames are inertial. So, according to the Galilean relativity, if two objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities are the same but opposite in direction. But wait, that's in the Newtonian view. But since we're dealing with speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, maybe relativistic effects come into play.

Wait, 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into a fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light. That's 20% the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be noticeable but not extreme. But for this problem, maybe we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula?

Wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So perhaps we need to find the velocity of the ejecta as seen from the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by time to get the distance.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of relative velocity. But Galilean transformations wouldn't apply here because we're dealing with significant fractions of c. So we'll need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me think: in the problem, the Galaxy
