Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first, and second excited states.

Wait, the well has length L, and each particle is spin-1/2, so they are fermions. Right, because electrons, for example, are spin-1/2 and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So that matters because identical fermions can't occupy the same quantum state.

The energy formula is given as E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which I remember from the infinite potential well model. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n. The energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = (n²)E, because E scales with n squared. So, for each particle, E = E_1, E_2, etc., where E_1 is the ground state energy for a single particle.

But wait, when there are multiple particles, each one will occupy different states due to the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So for four particles, they have to fill up the lowest available states without any two in the same state.

Wait, but wait, in a 1D box, each state is characterized by the quantum number n, and for each n, there's a spin state. But since the particles are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

So let's think about how the four particles would fill the energy levels.

Ground state: The lowest energy configuration. Since each n can hold two particles, but the particles are fermions, each with a unique state.

So for four particles:

The first two particles go into the lowest energy level, n=1, but each with opposite spin. That's two particles.
The next two go into the next available level, n=2, again each with opposite spin. So that's another two particles.

So in this case, the total energy would be the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle in n=1 has E_1 = (1²)E = E. Each in n=2 has E_2 = (2²)E =4E.

But wait, wait a second. Because the particles are identical, and their wavefunctions are antisymmetric. But in terms of calculating the system's energy, each particle's energy adds up. So the total energy is the sum of each individual particle's energy.

So for ground state:

Two particles in n=1: 2 * E = 2E.

Two particles in n=2: 2 *4E =8E.

So total energy is 2E +8E =10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Looking at the options:

Option A: 30E,
