Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Hamiltonian operator. The question gives me the Hamiltonian as H equals epsilon times sigma dot n. Sigma is the Pauli vector, made up of the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. They are 2x2 matrices, right? And the dot product sigma · n would be the sum of each sigma_i multiplied by n_i, where n is a unit vector, so the sum of squares of its components is 1.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon * (sigma · n). So H is a 2x2 matrix because each sigma is 2x2. To find the eigenvalues, I know that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are given by the trace over 2 and minus the same. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the matrix as a vector multiplied by these Pauli matrices.

Oh right! The Pauli matrices have the property that when multiplied by a vector, the resulting matrix is proportional to that vector in some sense. Specifically, the trace of sigma · n would be zero because each sigma_i has trace zero, and the trace is linear. Wait, but the trace isn't directly giving me the eigenvalues here.

Wait, another approach: The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix product. Since sigma · n is a traceless matrix (because each Pauli matrix is traceless and n is a unit vector), the eigenvalues should come in pairs of +a and -a, where a is some magnitude.

What's the magnitude of sigma · n? Let me think. The Pauli matrices are each Hermitian and have eigenvalues ±1. So when multiplied by a vector, the overall matrix sigma · n would also be Hermitian because n is a real unit vector. Wait, but wait, in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon * (sigma · n). So if sigma · n is a Hermitian matrix, then its eigenvalues should be real.

The magnitude of the eigenvalues would be the same as the operator's norm. The operator sigma · n would have eigenvalues ±1 because each Pauli matrix is normalized such that sigma_i^2 = I for each i. Wait, no, sigma · n is a sum of sigma_i times n_i. So (sigma · n)^2 would be equal to (n · sigma)(n · sigma)
