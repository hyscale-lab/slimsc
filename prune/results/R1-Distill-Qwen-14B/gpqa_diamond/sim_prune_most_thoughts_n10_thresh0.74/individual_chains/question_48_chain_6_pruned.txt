Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1. Hmm, what reaction happens when a ketone reacts with bromine? Oh right, I think that's the haloform reaction. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have the right structure for the haloform reaction. Because haloform requires a methyl ketone, right? So maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, bromine could be adding across a double bond if the cyclohexanone is enolized or something. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a dienone? No, no, I think I'm mixing up reactions.

Wait another thought: bromine in a different solvent? Oh, maybe it's a bromination via an enol. Because cyclohexanone can't undergo haloform, but maybe it can undergo some kind of bromination. Or perhaps it's a dienone, but I don't think so here. Alternatively, maybe the bromine is adding to the ring. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone; maybe it's brominating the ring in an electrophilic substitution. But wait, ketones are deactivating groups, so the ring would be less reactive.
