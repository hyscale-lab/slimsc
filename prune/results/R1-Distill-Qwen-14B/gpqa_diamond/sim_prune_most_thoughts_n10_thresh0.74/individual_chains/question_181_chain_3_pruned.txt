Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux ratio question. Let me think through it step by step. 

First, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops. I remember that the pp chain is responsible for a lot of the Sun's energy production, especially in the core. The pp chain has different branches, and pp-III is one of them. I think it's the main branch in the proton-proton chain reactions.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino production? Well, the pp chain produces neutrinos, mainly electron neutrinos. The pp-III branch probably contributes a significant amount of these neutrinos. So stopping it would mean that a large part of the neutrino flux would drop.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I remember that the neutrinos from the pp chain have a spectrum that peaks at a certain energy, but I'm not exactly sure where.

Wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the pp-chain neutrinos. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos through the reaction where a boron-8 nucleus decays into two helium-4 nuclei. Boron-8 has a half-life of about 8.5 minutes. Oh wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm, that's interesting timing. Because the half-life of B-8 is about that time, maybe that's a clue.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would cease. But wait, neutrinos from the pp-III would have a certain energy range. Let's think about the neutrino energies. The pp-III branch leads to the production of 7 Be, which captures a proton to become B-8, then decays into two He-4 nuclei, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino would be around the Q-value of that decay. I think the Q-value for the B-8 decay is about 15.5 MeV, but the neutrino gets a fraction of that, maybe around 14 MeV? Or is that the pp-I branch?

Wait, no, I think the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the pp chain, which come in two main
