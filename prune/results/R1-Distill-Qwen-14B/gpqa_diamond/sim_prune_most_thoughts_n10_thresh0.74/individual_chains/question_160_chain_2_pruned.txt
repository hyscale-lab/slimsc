Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let me see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far-field diffraction pattern. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, okay. So first, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes more and more like a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. But wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For regular polygons, the apothem relates to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex). So in the limit as N goes to infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Or is it the apothem that's the same, and the radius would be larger?

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between apothem and radius for a regular polygon. For a regular N-gon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) by a = R * cos(π/N). So as N becomes very large (approaching infinity), π/N becomes very small, and cos(π/N) approaches 1. So the apothem a is approximately equal to R when N is large. So in the limit, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Wait, no, wait: if a = R cos(π/N), for large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) → 1. So a approaches R. So R ≈ a for large N. So the polygon's effective radius is a. Oh, but wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a circle is the same as the radius, right? So in this limit, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture's diffraction pattern in the far field.

Wait, but wait a second.
