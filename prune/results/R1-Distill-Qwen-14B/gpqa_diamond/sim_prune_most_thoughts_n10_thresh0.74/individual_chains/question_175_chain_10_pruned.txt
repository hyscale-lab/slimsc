Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's shaped like a spheroid. The symmetry axis is along the z-axis, and it's oscillating, so it should radiate some power. The question is about determining the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle, theta, which is 30 degrees, and also figuring out the possible form of the power function f in terms of lambda and theta.

Hmm, I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the angle theta from the axis of symmetry. For a dipole radiator, the power pattern is dipolar, meaning it falls off with the angle. Wait, dipole radiation patterns have a specific angular dependence. Oh right, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (1/(r)) and the angular part varies as cos(theta), but wait, no—more accurately, the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), right? Or wait, maybe it's cos(theta) for the dipole's radiation direction.

Wait, no, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum along the axis (theta=0 and theta=180 degrees), and zero at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity pattern is like a cosine squared, maybe. Wait, no, wait: dipole radiation's intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), no. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the dipole case, the electric field in the far zone is proportional to (1/r) * sin(theta) * e^{i(kr - ωt)}, and the intensity is proportional to E^2. So E squared would give sin^2(theta) terms. So the intensity (which relates to power per unit area) depends on sin^2(theta). But wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta=90 degrees? No, wait, no. Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees (i.e
