Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, let me think about the relative speed. Wait, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in classical mechanics, you'd just do v1 - v2, but that doesn't work here.

The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, wait, no, I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) when both are moving in the same direction. Or is it (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c^2))? Let me get that right. Oh wait, the formula is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1 v2)/(c squared)). Because if v1 is the speed of the first object, and v2 is the speed of the second object from the first's frame, you need to adjust for the relativity.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The relative speed calculation is from the perspective of one astronaut. Let's say astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

So in the lab frame, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So to get the relative speed of B from A's perspective, we use the formula.

So v_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, if A is moving at 0.6c and B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v
