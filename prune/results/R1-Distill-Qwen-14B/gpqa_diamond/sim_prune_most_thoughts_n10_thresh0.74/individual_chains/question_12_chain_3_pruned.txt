Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Let's see what I remember about this. Hmm, the question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A through D, each with two KE values.

Wait, wait. I think I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with momenta that balance each other out.

But how does that help me find the kinetic energy? Oh right, the total energy of each product will be their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. Also, because the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass, 139.6 MeV.

So let's model this. The conservation of energy would mean that the total energy of the muon and neutrino adds up to the pion's rest mass energy. So,

Energy of muon (E_mu) + Energy of neutrino (E_nu) = 139.6 MeV.

Each of their energies is their rest mass plus kinetic energy. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

The neutrino's rest mass is practically zero, so E_nu = K_nu.

So, putting that into the equation:
105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6.

Wait, but K_mu and K_nu are related because their momenta are equal and opposite. From momentum conservation, the magnitudes are the same, so |p_mu| = |p_nu|. And since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, but I'm working in units where c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So for the muon, E_mu^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

For the neutrino, E_nu^2 = p^2 + 0^2 = p^2. So E_nu = p.

So substituting E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu and E_nu = K_nu, we have:

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding that, 105.7^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2.

Simplify: 2*105.7*K_mu + K_mu^2 = p^2.

But from the neutrino's energy, p = E_nu = K_nu.

So now, from energy conservation: 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6.

Let me call K_nu = p, so K_mu = 139.6 - 105.7 - p = 33.9 - p.

Wait, let me calculate 139.6 minus 105.7: that's 33.9 MeV. So K_mu = 33.9 - p.

Now plug back into the earlier equation:

2*105.7*(33.9 - p) + (33.9 - p)^2 = p^2.

Let me compute the left side.

First, 2*105.7 is 211.4.

So 211.4*(33.9 - p) = 211.4*33.9 - 211.4 p.

211.4 * 33
