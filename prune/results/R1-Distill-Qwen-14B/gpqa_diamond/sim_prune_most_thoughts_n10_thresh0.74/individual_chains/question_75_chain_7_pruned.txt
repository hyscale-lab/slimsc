Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about gene expression and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. So, the scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with an added influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. But when they tried to express it in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, it didn't overexpress as expected. They're looking into why and found something wrong in their construct's sequence.

Looking at the options, the issue is probably related to the construct's design causing the protein not to be expressed properly. Let's think about each option.

Option A says the sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. A missense would change an amino acid. But wait, the problem is overexpression failure, not the function of the tag. If the tag has a mutation, it might affect purification, but the question is about expression. So maybe not this option.

Option B suggests the ribosome terminated early. That sounds like a premature stop codon. If the coding sequence has a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA) early on, the ribosome would stop translating before the full protein is made. Looking at the given sequence, I need to check if there are any in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Let me scan through for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... etc. Hmm, let's see. The first possible stop codon after ATG would be if there's a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the reading frame. Let's go through the sequence in triplets.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC... Wait, ATTA is not a stop. Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Wait, looking further: Let's continue. The sequence after ATG is TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartate), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arg)... Hmm, no stops yet. Let's see further.

Looking at the end of the sequence: ...CGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, looking at the last part: GAG TGA. GAG is glutamic acid, TGA is a stop codon. Oh! So the construct ends with GAG TGA. So the stop codon is TGA in frame?

Wait, wait. The plus strand is given, which is the same as the mRNA except T for U. So the mRNA would have U instead of T. So the stop codon in the mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop codon. So the coding sequence ends with GAG UGA. So the UGA is a stop codon. So the protein would terminate after that. But wait, the original gene's coding sequence should have its own stop codon at the end. Oh, but maybe the construct was designed without considering the reading frame.

Wait, the construct has a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the start is ATG, then the HA tag sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, then the stop codon. If in the construct, the HA tag's sequence, when added, creates an early stop codon, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Wait, but looking at the construct's sequence, the very first codon is ATG, which is start. Then TAC is Tyr, CCA Pro, TAC Tyr, GAT Asp, etc. Then, looking at the end, the last codons are GAG (Glu), then TGA (which is a stop). So the stop codon is at the end. But wait, the original gene probably ends with its own stop, but perhaps the construct was designed to include it. So if the HA tag is added with a linker that includes a stop codon, or if the new sequence introduced an in-frame stop codon, that could be the issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the construct doesn't have a proper termination codon. Because the HA tag is added at N-terminus, the construct would have the ATG start, then the HA, then the GADD45G coding sequence, and then a stop codon. But looking at the given sequence, the last part is ...GCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAA
