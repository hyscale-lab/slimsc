Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, okay.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So I need to compute ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ for the given state.

I remember that the expectation value is linear, so I can break this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier. So I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

First, let's think about σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should simplify things. The given state is a linear combination, so the coefficients will matter.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Wait a second, let me check if these coefficients are normalized. The square of 0.5 is 0.25, and the square of sqrt(3)/2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, the state is correctly normalized.

Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let's compute that.

|a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the more tricky part is σx. The expectation value of σx for a spin-1/2 particle in a state ψ is given by... Hmm. I think it's ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Alternatively, there's another way to compute this using the coefficients a and b.

Wait, I remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σx can be found using the relation ⟨σx⟩ = ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) + 2 Re( a b* ) times something? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let's think about the matrix
