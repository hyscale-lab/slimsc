Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². So the force is like Hooke's law, F = -kr, but in this case, k is mω². 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. I think the energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator are quantized. Oh wait, in three dimensions, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number. So for the 3D isotropic case, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, the energy levels formula for a 3D isotropic oscillator. I recall it's E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. So n = nx + ny + nz. Each of these can be 0,1,2,... 

But wait, sometimes it's written as E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω, but another way I've seen is that the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers. So the ground state is when n=0, first excited when n=1,
