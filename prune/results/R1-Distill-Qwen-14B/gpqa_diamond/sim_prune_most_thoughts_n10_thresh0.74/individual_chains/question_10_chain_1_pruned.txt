Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a different exoplanet scenario. I'm a bit confused about how mass and radius relate to density, but I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh wait, volume depends on the radius. So the formula for density is mass divided by (4/3 π r³). Oh right, because volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So that would be option A being 5.5, but wait, let me check the options again. Wait, the options are a to d as the exoplanet scenarios. So option a's density is Earth's, which is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but what's its radius? Oh wait, the density is given directly as 5.5, same as Earth. So if the planet has twice the mass but same density as Earth, then its volume must be twice Earth's volume? Because density is mass/volume. So if density is same, mass = density * volume. So if mass is double, then volume is double. Volume depends on radius cubed. Let me calculate the radius. Let's see, Earth's volume is (4/3)πR³. So if the volume is double, then (4/3)π (r')³ = 2*(4/3)π R³. So r'³ = 2 R³ → r' = cube root of 2 * R, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So this planet is larger than Earth but same density. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition implies same density, right? Because density is mass per unit volume, and if the composition is same, the density should be same. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet's density is also 5.5. But wait, let me think again. Because if it's more massive and same composition, the density remains same because it's scaled appropriately. So this planet's density is same as Earth.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density as Earth, 5.5. But wait, if the mass is less, but same composition, then the radius would be smaller. Because mass = density * volume. Volume is (4/3)πr³. So if mass is half, and density same, volume is half. So (r')³ = (M')/(density) → M'=0.5 M_earth. So r'³ = (0.5 M_earth) / (density) → but Earth is M_earth = density * (4/3 π R_earth³). So for this planet, r'³ = (0.5 M_earth) / (density) = 0.5
