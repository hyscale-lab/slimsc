Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by recalling what optical isomerism is. From what I remember, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't symmetrical and can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups.

Looking at the question, there are four compounds given, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Let me visualize this. It's a biphenyl structure, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. The groups attached are nitro groups and methyl ester groups. Wait, nitro groups are strong meta directors, but more importantly, the structure here is symmetrical. Biphenyl rings can sometimes have symmetry. But I'm not sure if the substituents make it symmetrical or not. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry. If that's the case, there might not be any chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the bridge or the substituents create asymmetry. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a chiral center. Are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

Wait, the substituents are on the biphenyl. The connecting carbon (the one where the two phenyl rings meet) is connected to two methyl ester groups (since it's a dimethyl ester) and two nitro groups, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro, so each phenyl has a nitro at position 6. The 2,2'-dicarboxylate suggests that each phenyl has a carboxylate at position 2. So each phenyl ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. The central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is connected to two phenyl rings and two oxygen atoms from the ester groups. Wait, no, the ester groups are on the phenyl rings. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (so that's two of the bonds), and then the other two bonds are to what? Wait, no, in biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected via a single bond, so the central atom is a carbon (the bridge). So the bridge carbon is connected to two benzene rings and two other groups? No, in biphenyl, each ring is connected via a single bond, so the central carbon is a single atom connecting the two rings. So the substituents are on the benzene rings, not on the central bridge. So the bridge's carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two other groups. Wait, no, the bridge carbon is attached to two benzene rings and is connected by a single bond. So the bridge carbon would have four bonds: two to the benzene rings, and two more? Wait, no, wait. Each benzene ring has a carbon connected to the bridge. So each ring has a carbon (say, C1) connected to the bridge. The bridge is a single carbon, so the bridge is a CH2 group? Or is it just a single bond between the two C1s? Wait, 1,1'-biphenyl means that the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond between their C1 carbons. So the structure is two benzene rings connected at their C1 positions. So each C1 is connected to the other C1 via a single bond. That means that the bridge is actually a single carbon atom, but each C1 is part of its respective benzene ring and connected to the other C1. So the bridge is a single bond between C1 of each ring.

In this case, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 of each benzene ring. So the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. So looking at the bridge (the C1-C1 bond), neither of the C1 carbons are attached to four different groups. Because C1 is attached to the benzene ring (which is a bulky substituent, but the same on both rings), and perhaps other substituents. Wait, but the bridge itself is a single bond between the two C1s, so each C1 is connected to three other carbons: two from their own ring and one from the other ring? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Do any of the substituents create a chiral center elsewhere? For example, the ester groups, like the methyl groups.

Wait, the compound is dimethyl, so the ester groups are OMe. So, each carboxylate is OMe, so each phenyl has a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents on each benzene are: at 2: COOCH3 and at 6: NO2. So when looking at the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents on each benzene are mirror images, then the molecule as a whole could be symmetrical—like if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is its own mirror image. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion.

Wait, but wait, if each ring has the same substituents, maybe the entire molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule could be achiral. So, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Or maybe the bridge has some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the bridge is a central carbon with four different groups. Wait, the bridge is a single carbon connected to two benzene rings. So each benzene ring is attached, and perhaps other substituents on that bridge carbon. Wait, no, the bridge is part of the benzene rings. So each benzene is connected via the bridge. So the bridge carbon (each C1) is connected to three other carbons in its own ring and the bridge (the other C1). So each bridge C1 is connected to three ring carbons and another C1. Hmm, but each C1 is attached to three carbons in its ring, which are all similar—so maybe it's not a chiral center. So, perhaps this compound doesn't have optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw that. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methyl, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (
