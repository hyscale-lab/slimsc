Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions, right? So the density is the same everywhere. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. 

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means as the parallax increases, the stars are closer to us because distance is smaller.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would there be?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's model this. The volume of a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because volume is 4π r² dr. Wait, but since we're dealing with parallax, and plx = 1/d, perhaps I should express this in terms of plx.

So, let's think about it. The number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell at a distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Also, dd would be d(plx) when plx changes by dplx. Let me calculate dd in terms of dplx.

dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering the thickness, the magnitude would be (1/plx²) dplx. So, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Now, the volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) dplx, so:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Since the number of stars is the volume multiplied by the number density (n), and n is constant, the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's for a thin shell. So, the number per unit range of plx (dplx) would be n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range (dplx) goes as 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space is decreasing with higher plx (since higher plx means closer, so more stars in a given plx range? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, if plx is small, that implies large distance (like, very far away). So, for a given small range of plx (say, 0.01 to 0.02 arcseconds), how many stars are there? But according to the calculation, the number goes as 1/plx^4, which would mean that as plx gets smaller (i.e., larger distance), the number of stars in a given dplx would decrease, because 1/plx^4 becomes smaller when plx is smaller.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, for a given dplx, the volume is 4π d² dd, and d is 1/plx. So when plx is small (d is large), the volume of the shell (4π d² dd) would be large because d is large. But how does this translate into the number of stars per unit plx?

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So for a given dplx, which is the same size in plx, how does the number vary with plx? So, for a small dplx, you're looking at a thin shell at distance d. The number of stars is proportional to the volume, which is 4π d^2 (dd). But since dd is dplx * (d^2) (because plx = 1/d, so dplx = d^2 dd). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let's think more carefully.

The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. Here, r is the distance, which is 1/plx. So dr is the change in distance corresponding to a change in plx. So plx = 1/r → r = 1/plx. So dr = (d (1/plx)) ) = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. But for the volume, we take the absolute value, so dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So the volume element is 4π (r)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So if we're considering the number per unit plx, which is dN/dplx, it would be n * 4π (1/plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx range (dN) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space decreases as plx increases. Wait, but wait, when plx increases (closer stars), the number of stars in a given dplx would be higher, right? Because there are more stars closer in. But according to this, 1/plx^4, which for higher plx (like plx=1) would be 1, but for higher plx (plx=0.01), it would be 1e8, which is way too big. That can't be right because at plx=0.01, the stars are very far, so the volume is larger but the number of stars should be less. Wait, but according to the calculation, when plx is small, 1/plx^4 is very large, but that would mean that for a given dplx, the number of stars is higher, which contradicts intuition.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The number density n is the number per unit volume. So if stars are uniformly distributed, n is a constant. So the number of stars in the volume element (4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is n * 4π / plx^4.

So for a given dplx (say, 0.1 to 0.2), the number of stars would be higher when plx is smaller (since 1/plx^4 is larger). But that would mean that, for example, at a higher distance (smaller plx), a given dplx (like 0.1) would include more stars, which doesn't make sense. Because in reality, when you look at a certain range of parallax (same dplx), as you go to larger distances (smaller plx), the volume increases, but the number of stars in that volume depends on the number density. Wait, but if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (n) is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a volume element would be n times the volume. So for a given dplx, the volume increases as 1/plx^4, so the number of stars in that volume would increase as 1/plx^4. That would mean that, for a given dplx, the number of stars is higher when plx is smaller.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because when plx is smaller (distance is larger), the volume element is bigger, so if stars are uniformly distributed, there should be more stars in that volume. So, yes, the number of stars per unit plx (dN) would increase as 1/plx^4. So the number of stars in a small plx range (dplx) would be higher when you're looking at a small plx (large distance), which makes sense because the volume is larger. So the number per dplx would be higher for lower plx. 

Wait, but the question is about how the number per unit plx changes with plx. So the number goes as 1/plx^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of parallax. So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * Volume. The Volume is the volume of the spherical shell between plx and plx + dplx. 

So Volume = 4π r² dr, but r = 1/plx. So dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. So Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per dplx is N/dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4). So the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) as \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \) into the volume formula, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the product of the number density (\( n \), the number of stars per unit volume) and the volume. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto n \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
