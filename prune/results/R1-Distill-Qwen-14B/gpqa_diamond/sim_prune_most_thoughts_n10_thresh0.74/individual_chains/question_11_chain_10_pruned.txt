Okay, so I've got this question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I need to find the incorrect statement. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is which statement is incorrect. All the options are about different aspects of the virus's biology. Let me go step by step.

Option A: It talks about nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN working as heterodimers in mismatch repair. I remember that SARS-CoV-2 has several non-structural proteins, and nsp10 usually partners with nsp14. Wait, isn't nsp14's ExoN domain an exonuclease? Oh right, I think the ExoN is involved in removing RNA after replication. Oh wait, but I've also heard that the ExoN activity is important for proofreading, but I'm not super sure. Wait, some papers say that nsp14 has a proofreading 3'â†’5' exonuclease activity. And nsp10 is a cofactor, so they form a heterodimer. But the statement says the N-terminal ExoN domain binds nsp10 to make an active complex that prevents dsRNA breakdown. Hmm, wait, wouldn't preventing breakdown mean it's not acting as an exonuclease? Because exonucleases break down. So if they bind, maybe it's active in repair, but I'm a bit confused. I'll need to think more about this.

Option B: This option says that ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic pathway, while Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. So if ORF3a triggers caspase-8, that suggests extrinsic apoptosis. But I also remember that during viral infections, sometimes viruses can trigger both pathways. Wait, but if Bcl-2 levels aren't affected, then maybe the intrinsic pathway isn't being used. So the statement says the mechanism is extrinsic. I think this might be correct because some studies show ORF3a induces apoptosis via caspase-8, which is extrinsic. So B might be correct, so not the wrong statement.

Option C: This is about frameshifting in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Frameshifting
