Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product 3. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let's go through each step.

First reaction: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration usually happens in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration adds a nitro group. Where does it go? Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitro group would likely add to the para position because the methyl is an activating group and directs incoming substituents to the para position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Second reaction: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh right, MnO2 in sulfuric acid is a strong oxidizing agent. In the context of nitro groups, I think this is a nitration followed by oxidation. Wait, no. Wait, MnO2 is used for oxidation. Specifically, nitro groups can be reduced or oxidized. Wait, but nitro groups in aromatic rings are usually pretty stable. Oh wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. MnO2 is used in the oxidation of nitro groups to nitro groups? No, wait, when you have a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, treating with a strong oxidizing agent like MnO2 would convert the nitro group into a nitro group? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, MnO2 is involved in the oxidation of benzylic positions. Oh wait, in para-nitrotoluene, the methyl group is attached to the ring and the nitro is para to it. The methyl group is a CH3 attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps the MnO2 is oxidizing the benzylic position. Benzylic oxidation typically converts CH3 to COOH. So the methyl (CH3) group in para-nitrotoluene would oxidize to a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, but benzoic acid has the COOH directly attached. Wait, no, wait, para-nitrotoluene has nitro and methyl on the benzene. Oxidizing the methyl would give a COOH group. So the product would be para-nitrobenzene with a COOH
