Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that photospheres are the outermost layers of stars where light is emitted. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. They also mention that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that the conditions there follow the usual physical laws, including the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for energy states.

So, I need to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars. The options are A to D, each with a different equation involving ln(2). 

I remember that in thermodynamics, the population of energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann distribution equation is probably involved here. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is the ratio of the populations of two energy levels. The population of a higher energy level divided by a lower one is equal to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me think: if the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, how does the ratio of their populations relate to their temperatures?

Let me denote the two energy levels as E2 and E1, with E2 being higher than E1 by ΔE. The population ratio n2/n1 is given by exp(-ΔE/(kT)). 

But wait, in the question, it's stated that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. I think that means that n2 (the number in the
