Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound is reacted through a series of reagents. My goal is to find the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The 1H-NMR shows the following peaks:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

Let me interpret each peak.

Starting with the triplet at 9.72 ppm. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Wait, but wait, sometimes it could be an aromatic proton in certain substitution patterns, but aldehyde is more likely. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Hmm, but here it's a triplet. So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinylic proton, like in an enal (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which can sometimes show splitting due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets each with 2H. These could be part of an aromatic ring. Let me think: if there's a para-substituted aromatic ring, the protons would typically be split into two doublets. For example, if there's a substituent on the ring, like an electron-withdrawing group, the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps these are part of a di-substituted benzene ring.

The peak at 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. A broad peak could indicate exchange with water, perhaps an -OH proton, but since it's a singlet and 2H, maybe it's adjacent to something else. Alternatively, perhaps this is a vinyl proton, but the broadness is confusing. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aromatic ring with two protons in a symmetrical
