Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. It's kind of complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a bicistronic vector used to express a ligand and a receptor in cells. They used this vector in primary astrocyte culture and then in a mouse model. After some experiments, they didn't see a green signal under the microscope. I need to figure out why that happened.

First, let me try to understand the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. So, for the ligand, CBA promoter drives its expression, and the IRES probably allows internal ribosome entry for the receptor's expression, meaning both proteins can be expressed from the same mRNA but in separate ORFs.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, these stop signals prevent read-through from one ORF to another unless the cassettes are removed.

They used Cre to delete these stop cassettes. So when Cre is present, it would recombine and remove the stop, allowing expression of both proteins. But wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites, right? LoxP is recognized by Cre, which is a recombinase. Lox2272 is a variant, but I think Cre can still recognize it, but perhaps with lower efficiency or specific conditions.

In the mouse model, they made the construct homozygous in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, so maybe the Cre is expressed there. The idea is that Cre would recombine the lox sites, enabling expression of the ligand and receptor.

But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. eGFP is green, so the receptor-eGFP wasn't expressed, or wasn't functional. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that would affect the expression in this case, especially since they were using primary astrocytes and then the mouse model. Maybe if it's paracrine, the ligand acts on other cells, but in the Western blot, they saw expression? Wait, the question says they did a Western blot after transfection and saw signals proportional to actin, but that was after plasmid transfection. Wait, no, the Western blot was for the construct expression. Wait, the question says: "You use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection..." So after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes, they ran a Western blot. So the expression was detected, meaning that the plasmid was working in the transfected cells. But in the mouse, when they crossed with SOX10-Cre, they didn't see green. Hmm.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see eGFP under the microscope because it's stuck. But why would it be stuck? So the stop cassette was deleted, so the receptor should be expressed. But maybe the construct has a problem with proper Golgi processing. Or perhaps if the eGFP is not correctly tagged. But I'm not sure.

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, so expression shouldn't be an issue. The receptor is under IRES, which is a weaker promoter but should still work. But if the enhancer was missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But they did express in the transfected cells, so the promoter must be working.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, right! When you have a stop cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP, if the stop isn't removed correctly, the receptor won't be expressed. Wait, no. Let me think. The construct is ligand (with loxP-stop-loxP) and then mCherry. Then the IRES, and the receptor is in the 3' ORF, with lox2272-stop-lox22
