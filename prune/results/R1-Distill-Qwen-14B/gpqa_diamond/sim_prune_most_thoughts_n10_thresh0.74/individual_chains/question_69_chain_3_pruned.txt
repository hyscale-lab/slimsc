Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions.

Wait, okay, so I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the resolution needed? Oh, right! The bubble chamber can only detect particles if they decay within a certain path length. If the decay happens too far away, the chamber can't track it. So the resolution (the minimum detectable length) relates to how far the particles travel before decaying.

Wait, wait. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So, that means we want the decay length to be greater than the resolution, otherwise we can't detect it. Or wait, no—wait, the resolution is the smallest length that the detector can distinguish. So, maybe if the decay length is larger than the resolution, we can see it. Or perhaps if the decay length is longer than the minimum required, so a certain fraction of the decays (30%) have a decay length above that.

Wait, let me think about the decay length formula. The decay length L is given by L = c * τ * β γ. Because the particle is moving at a speed v, which is βc, and γ is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime in lab frame is τ = γ τ₀, so L = β γ c τ₀.

But I also know that the energy of the particle is given. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So I can find the velocity and γ from that.

Wait, the energy E is related to the mass and momentum by E =
