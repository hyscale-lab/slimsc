Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To distinguish them, the ΔE must be larger than both uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, measurements might not clearly show the difference. 

So the minimum required energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than both, then the states are definitely distinguishable. So the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 is ΔE2 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So ΔE must be larger than about 6.5e-8 eV. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV, which is way smaller than 6.5e-8. So no, not enough.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller. Not good.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's way larger than 6.5e-8. So this should be sufficient.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → which is about 1e-8. Hmm, but our required minimum is about 6.5e-8 eV. So 1e-8 is smaller than that. So D might not be enough.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. I calculated ΔE for each state. The uncertainty in their measured energy would be something like ħ/τ. So for E1, the uncertainty is about 6.5e-7 eV, and E2's uncertainty is 6.5e-8 eV. 

But wait, when you're trying to measure the energy difference between E1 and E2, the uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of their individual uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps each contributes, but since they're independent, maybe it's the square root of the sum of squares. Hmm, getting a bit confused now.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to think about the energy difference needing to be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement for each. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty from each state. 

Wait, I think the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of each, then you can resolve them. 

So the maximum uncertainty is from E1's state, which is about 6.5e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.5e-7 eV. 

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 6.5e-7 (which is 0.00000065). So that's good.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 6.5e-7. So D is not enough.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. Because when you measure both E1 and E2, the combined uncertainty could be the sum, or perhaps the root of sum of squares. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think.

Suppose you have two states, each with their own uncertainties. The energy difference E2 - E1 would have an uncertainty of sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming they are independent. 

So let's calculate that. 

ΔE1 is about 6.56e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV. 

ΔE_diff ≈ sqrt( (6.56e-7)^2 + (6.56e-8)^2 ) 

= sqrt( (4.3e-13) + (4.3e-15) )

≈ sqrt(4.3043e-13) ≈ about 6.56e-7 eV again. Because the second term is negligible compared to the first.

So the combined uncertainty is about 6.56e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than this. 

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger. The others are smaller. 

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \). Here, the lifetimes of the states (\( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)) serve as the time uncertainties (\( \Delta t \)).

For \( E_1 \), the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For \( E_2 \), the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the combined uncertainty in energy. The combined uncertainty is approximately the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx \sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx \sqrt{(6.56 \times 10^{-7})^2 + (6.56 \times 10^{-8})^2}.
\]

The second term is negligible compared to the first, so:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{diff}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the energy difference must be larger than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: Sufficiently large (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \)).
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: Too small.

The correct answer is **Option C**.
