Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember from my studies that in our current understanding, magnets can't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. That's called the magnetic monopole problem, right? But in this scenario, they do have isolated poles, so Maxwell's equations must change somehow.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère-Maxwell Law: ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

So, in our universe, the divergence of B is zero, which enforces that idea that there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles). But if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, then that equation must change, right?

So the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, would no longer have ∇·B = 0. Instead, it would be something like ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is some magnetic permeability constant and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. That makes sense because if there are isolated poles, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

Now, the question is which equations are different. So looking at the options, which Maxwell equations would change.

Wait, the options are about which equations are different. So let's think about each option.

Option A says the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That's exactly the second equation I mentioned. So in our universe, that equation is different if monopoles exist. So if the universe allows isolated poles, this equation must change. So option A would be changing.

Wait, but the question says "which of those equations are different?" The options are options for which equations are different.

Wait the question is in a universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. So that implies that magnetic monopoles exist. So Maxwell's equations would have to include magnetic charge terms.

So in our current equations, the divergence of B is zero. If magnetic monopoles exist, that equation would change. Also, Faraday's law would change. Because when you have a magnetic current, the curl of E would have a contribution from the time derivative of the magnetic current.

Wait, let me think. In our current equations, the curl of E is -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, then Maxwell's equations would have additional terms. So for example, the modified Ampère and Faraday's laws might include terms for magnetic current and charge.

Wait, actually, when magnetic monopoles exist, the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields changes. So the equations become more symmetric. So both Gauss's laws (for E and B) and the Faraday and Ampère laws would change.

Wait no, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is no longer zero. That's the first change. Also, the curl of E would pick up a term related to the magnetic current density.

In our universe
