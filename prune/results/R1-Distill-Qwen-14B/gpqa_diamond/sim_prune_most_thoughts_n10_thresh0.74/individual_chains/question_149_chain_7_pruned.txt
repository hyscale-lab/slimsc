Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down.

So the question says that the 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Wait, alpha-protons are those attached to the carbonyl group in peptides, right? Like next to the amide or something. So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. They have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Hmm. So each peak is about 0.5H? Or maybe one is 0.6 and the other 0.4 or something, but together they make 1H.

But why would a single proton split into two peaks? Wait, coupling with another spin could cause splitting, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like vicinal coupling or something. Oh wait, another possibility is that the proton is in a diastereotopic environment. Like if the molecule has some symmetry or if the protons are in different environments due to stereochemistry.

Looking at the LC-MS part, the crude compound shows two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight, same retention time? Wait, elevated temperature usually makes peaks come out faster, but they're clearly defined. So the two peaks have same mass but maybe different retention times? Or same retention time? Wait, the question says two peaks of equal intensities, same mass. So same mass but different something else. Same mass would imply same m/z, so same molecular weight. But why two peaks?

In the NMR, same mass would mean same molecular formula, but maybe different structures. Could it be a mixture of diastereomers or enantiomers? Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so they might separate on LC-MS. Enantiomers, on the other hand, have same physical properties except for chiral columns, but LC-MS might not separate them unless using a chiral column. But the question's LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, same mass. So maybe diastereomers because they have different properties and would separate.

But
