Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester group absorption, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum gives some specific signals: two aromatic H's, two vinyl H's (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. There's no –CH2 signal, which is interesting.

Hmm. So I need to figure out the structure based on the NMR data and then match it to the molecular formulas given. The options are all C11H...O2 or C12H...O2. Let's think about what the structure might look like.

First, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents are attached to the aromatic ring. The presence of an ester group (from IR) suggests that one of the substituents is an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', so maybe one substituent is an ester group.

The NMR tells us about the types of hydrogens present. Let's break down each part:

1. Aromatic H: two signals. Wait, benzene rings with substituents usually have more complex splitting. Two signals could mean that the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to two distinct sets of aromatic H's. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring might have two equivalent H's in each ortho position, but wait, that would be two signals each with two H's. Or maybe the substituents are in a way that the ring has symmetry, leading to two types of H's. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta substitution, but that usually gives more signals. Wait, but the substituents are di, so two substituents on the ring. Let's think: maybe the substituents are ester and something else, and that creates a certain symmetry.

Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals. So perhaps the ring has two sets of equivalent H's. For example, if the substituents are para, then each substituent would have two equivalent H's adjacent to it, but that would result in two sets, each with two H's. So maybe the ring is para-substituted with two groups, each causing two H signals. But wait, the substituents themselves could influence the ring's H signals.

2. Vinyl H: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are typically from double bonds, like in alkenes. So maybe there are two different vinyl groups. Alternatively, a single vinyl group that's coupled with something else. The doublet of quartets suggests that these H's are next to another group with more H's. For example, perhaps a CH2CH2 group or something else where the coupling leads to quartets. But wait, the NMR shows no –CH2 groups, so maybe it's a CH3 group next to a double bond?

3. Two –CH3 groups: so two methyl groups in the structure. Let me think about where they could be. If one of the substituents is an ester, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. Wait, an ester is usually R-O-CO-R', so perhaps the substituent is like -O-CO-R. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a methyl ester, so -O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', so for example, methyl ester would be -O-CO-OCH3. Hmm, but that's a possibility.

Wait, but let's think about possible structures. Let me try to imagine the molecule. Di-substituted benzene: two groups attached. One is an ester, perhaps. The other group could be another substituent that has a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H's. So maybe one substituent is the ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group connected to something, perhaps with methyl groups attached.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a propenyl group or something similar. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester (like -O-CO-CH2CH3), but that would have more H's. Or maybe it's a substituted ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a methyl group and a vinyl group attached to an ester. Wait, but I'm trying to tie this back to the NMR data.

Let me think of possible structures. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, like -O-CO-R, where R is some group. The other substituent could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Wait, or perhaps the other substituent is an acetyl group or something else.
