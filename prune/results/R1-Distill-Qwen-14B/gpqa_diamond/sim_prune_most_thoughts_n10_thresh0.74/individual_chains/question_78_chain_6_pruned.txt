Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're observing the fields at a point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr.

Wait, I remember that potentials are important in electromagnetism. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

Let me recall. The scalar potential V due to a charge q is usually given by Coulomb's law, something like V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But wait, when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential change? Or is it still that simple?

Wait, for a stationary charge, V is straightforward. But when the charge moves, there's a delay because the fields take time to propagate. So at time t, the effect of the charge's motion at time tr (where tr = t - r/c, assuming it's moving at speed v much less than c?) would be considered.

Wait, but the options given have some options with just 1/r and others with terms involving c and velocity v. So I need to figure out which expressions are correct.

I remember that when a charge is moving, the potentials aren't just static anymore. The scalar potential might still be based on the charge's position, but the vector potential arises from its motion.

Another thought: The potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential comes from the electric field, which is influenced by the charge's position. The vector potential comes from the magnetic field, which arises due to the charge's motion (current).

But wait, for a single moving charge, the magnetic field isn't zero because a single moving charge doesn't produce a static magnetic dipole. However, the vector potential would still be non-zero due to the current element.

Wait, maybe the standard expressions for potentials when charges are moving involve some terms. Oh right! The scalar potential V is still given by the static Coulomb potential, but the vector
