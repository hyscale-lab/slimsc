Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So the question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. The setup is a 1D oscillator, obeying Hooke's law, F equals negative kx. Wait, but since it's relativistic, we can't just use the classical equations of motion like we normally would for a harmonic oscillator. I remember that in relativity, momentum and energy get a bit more complicated because of gamma factors.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so C can't be the right answer here. Or can it? Because maybe the problem is considering small amplitudes where relativistic effects are negligible, but the question states it's a maximum amplitude, so relativistic effects must be significant.

Wait, but the options include terms with c, so definitely relativity is a factor here. I should think about the relativistic energy equations. The total energy in relativity is gamma times mc squared, where gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The oscillator's potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². Because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's the difference between total energy and rest mass energy.

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, and the energy is entirely potential. At maximum speed, which occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E should be equal to the potential energy at maximum amplitude, which is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy when x is A. In the relativistic case, the mechanical energy would include both potential and kinetic, but we have to account for relativistic effects on the kinetic part.

So, the total energy E is the sum of potential and kinetic. But at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait no, that's in the non-relativistic case. Wait, no, in any case, at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is entirely potential: E = (1/2)kA². Then, when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc². Then, solving for gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma = 1 + (1/2)(kA²)/(mc²). Wait, let me write that more carefully.

So, (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

So, gamma = ( (1/2)kA² )/(mc² ) + 1.

Hmm, okay. Now, let's compute gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but wait, no:

Wait, (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2)kA² ) / ( mc² )

Which is gamma =
