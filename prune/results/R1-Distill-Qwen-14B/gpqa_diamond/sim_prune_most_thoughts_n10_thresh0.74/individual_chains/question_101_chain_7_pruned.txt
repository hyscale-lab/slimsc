Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product formed is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what A is and what catalyst B was used.

First, I'll try to understand the reaction. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Wait, cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So the structure is like a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group (CH2) to the pyrrolidine.

Hmm, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen and a methyl group on carbon 3. When it reacts with compound A under acid catalysis, it forms this new compound. So what kind of reaction is this?

I remember that acid catalysis is often involved in various reactions like esterifications, acid-catalyzed alkylation, or maybe even some ring-opening or cyclization reactions.

Looking at the product, it seems like the pyrrolidine is undergoing some kind of alkylation or perhaps a conjugate addition. Wait, but wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached via a CH2 group. So maybe it's an alkylation where a cyclohexene-derived electrophile is adding to the pyrrolidine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but pyrrolidine isn't aromatic, so Friedel-Crafts doesn't apply here. Hmm, maybe it's an alkylation via a carbocation.

Wait, another thought: if the compound A is an aldehyde, maybe it's undergoing some kind of condensation reaction, like a crossed aldol. But wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has an amine group. Oh, but the reaction is acid-catalyzed, so perhaps it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. When it reacts with an aldehyde under acidic conditions, maybe it's forming an imine or something similar. But the product doesn't look like an imine; it
