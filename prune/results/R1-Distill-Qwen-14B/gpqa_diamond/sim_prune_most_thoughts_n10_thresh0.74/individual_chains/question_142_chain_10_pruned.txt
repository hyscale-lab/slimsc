Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Right, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I think that's a diagonal matrix because the off-diagonal terms must be zero. So in matrix form, for a qubit, the basis states |0> and |1> correspond to the computational basis. The matrix would look like this:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Yeah, that's right. So each diagonal element is 1/2. But wait, I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh, right, I remember that the Bloch sphere representation is used for qubits. But wait, density matrices are more general. So the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? And this seems to be a mixed state because it's a classical mixture of |0> and |1>.

The density matrix for a pure state like |ψ><ψ| lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, it's inside. Wait, but how do I find the position in terms of coordinates (r_x, r_y, r_z)?

I think the Bloch sphere representation for a density matrix ρ is given by the vector r such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh right, because for a general state, ρ can be written as (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. So solving for r would give r = (x, y, z), and ρ = (I + r·σ)/2.

Let me apply that. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, let's compute this. Let me recall that |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) I.

So ρ = I/2. Now
