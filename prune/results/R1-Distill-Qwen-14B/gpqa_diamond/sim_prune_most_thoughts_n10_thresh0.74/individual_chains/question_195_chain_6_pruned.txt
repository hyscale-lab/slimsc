Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two planets in a system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. 

The question is asking about the maximum orbital period of a second planet. This second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, is also in a circular orbit, shares the same orbital plane, and we need to ensure that it exhibits both transit and occultation events.

Hmm, okay. So transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation, on the other hand, is when the planet passes behind the star, and the planet's light is blocked, so we don't see it. For both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it can both pass in front of the star (transit) and behind it (occultation). 

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first one? Oh, right, because for both events to be observable, the orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods allow for these events. But wait, the first planet's period is 3 days. The second has a longer period, but how much longer?

Wait, no. The question is about the maximum period of the second planet. So maybe it's about the relative orbital speeds or periods, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think more carefully.

Transit and occultation require that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough relative to us. But in this case, the first planet's impact parameter is given as 0.2. Impact parameter is the perpendicular distance from the star's center to the planet's path during transit, measured in units of the star's radius. So for the transit to occur, the planet must pass close enough to the star's disk. 

Wait, but how does that affect the second planet? Oh, perhaps the two planets are in the same system. So they might be orbiting the same star. So the star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. Let me note down the given
