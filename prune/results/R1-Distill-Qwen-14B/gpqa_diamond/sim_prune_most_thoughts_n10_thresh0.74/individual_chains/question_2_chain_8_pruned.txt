Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of carbon atoms in product 3. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde specifically has the double bond between the second and third carbon in the propenal, and the substituents on either side are on opposite sides. So, the structure would be something like benzene-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So, structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, that's not correct either. Oh wait, I think I'm confusing it with something else. Let me get this straight. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached via a propenal group. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a double bond. So it's Ph-CH₂-CHO with a double bond between the CH and the CHO. Oh wait, no, wait, no. Let
