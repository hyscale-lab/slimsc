Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. These three are all meta to one another. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid, there's a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. It also says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack.

First, I think I should draw a benzene ring and start placing the substituents according to the description. Let me visualize the benzene ring with the carboxylic acid as the primary functional group because it's the suffix in the IUPAC name, so it will get the lowest possible number.

Wait, the main functional group is the carboxylic acid, so that should be position 1. Let me label that as position 1. Then, the substituents meta to each other would be at positions 3, 5, and so on, but waitâ€”wait, the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are all meta to one another. So each is separated by one carbon in between.

Wait, no. If they're meta to each other, that means each is three carbons apart, but in a benzene ring, that's the same as being three apart in either direction, so each is at 1, 3, 5 positions. Wait, but the main functional group is the carboxylic acid, which is in position 1. So the other two, the carbaldehyde and cyano, should be in positions 3 and 5? Or maybe one in 3 and another in 5? Or perhaps all three are meta, but that's impossible because a benzene ring has six positions. Oh wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So each is meta to the others. So, their positions must be 1,3,5? Because that's the only way each is three apart from each other. So that makes sense.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem mentions
