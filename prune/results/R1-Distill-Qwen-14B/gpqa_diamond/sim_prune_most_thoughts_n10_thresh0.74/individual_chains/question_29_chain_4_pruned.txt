Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let's try to figure it out. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I think is ethyl methanesulfonate, a mutagen that causes point mutations, mostly base substitutions.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which I assume is produced by the gene. So they want to mutate the gene in a way that it doesn't produce the compound. That probably means disrupting the gene's function—so a mutation that causes a loss-of-function. Maybe a nonsense mutation or a frameshift that leads to a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, they've given the intact gene and four mutants. Each mutant shows changes in the first exon area. Exons are the coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, comparing to the intact gene. The fourth codon in the intact is TTC (which is phenylalanine). In Mutant 1, it's TCT (serine). Then there's a change in the 5th codon: CGC instead of CGT? Wait, let me count.

Wait, the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTC TCG C...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C...

Oh, wait, perhaps the second codon is different. Let me line them up.

At the beginning, the intact is ATG TTC TCG C...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C...

So in the first few codons, the second codon is TTC in intact, TCT in Mutant 1. So that's a change from Phe to Ser. Then the third codon in intact is TCG (Ser), but in Mutant 1, it's ACG (Thr). So two changes.

But how does that affect the protein? Well, substitutions might change the amino acids, but unless it's a stop codon, it might not completely eliminate the compound. Unless the substitution disrupts a critical part of the enzyme.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first changes. Intact is TTC TCG C..., Mutant 2 is TCT AAG C... So the second codon is TCT (Ser instead of Phe). Third codon AAG (Lys instead of Ser). So two changes here. Does that lead to a stop codon? Let's see:

Wait, the third codon in Mutant 2 is AAG (Lys)—K. Hmm, that's a substitution. So no stop codon yet. Maybe not the best option.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

First part: Intact has TTC TCG C..., Mutant 3 has TTT TAC GCT... Wait, let me see:

Wait, the first two codons in the intact are ATG TTC. So first codon is Met, second TTC (Phe).

In Mutant 3, the first codon is ATG, second TTT (Phe), third TAC (Tyr). So in the third codon, the intact had TCG (Ser), but this is TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution, but not a stop codon. However, looking further, I see that later in the sequence, the intact has TCT (Ser) and the mutant has GCT (Ala) and then GTG (Val). Wait, I think I may have misaligned the sequences. Alternatively, perhaps there's a longer change.

Wait, let me count the letters. The intact sequence is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the first part is:

ATG TTC TCG C G G TAC TT C TG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA T TGTCGT...

Mutant 3 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the first segment:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Hmm, so the second codon in the intact is TTC (Phe), in mutant3, it's TTT (Phe again, same amino acid). The third codon in intact is TCG (Ser), mutant3 is TAC (Tyr). So substitution from Ser to Tyr. Then next codon, intact had GCT (Ala), mutant3 has GCT (Ala same). Next is GGT (Gly), same. Then the mutant has GTC (Val), the intact has TAC (Tyr) in that position? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth codon in the mutant has a change. Let me see: perhaps this is a longer stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a frameshift? No, because all the sequences seem to be same length.

Wait, another approach: looking for stop codons. The intact ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So in all the mutants, the TGA is still at the end, meaning the stop is same.

Looking for any occurrence of a stop codon earlier. For example, if a mutation causes a TAA, TAG, or TGA somewhere in the coding sequence, leading to a premature stop.

Looking at Mutant 4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the initial part: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT... So the third codon is TAC (Tyr), same as in some others. Wait, let me see: the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in Mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So substitution. Any stop codons here?

Wait, perhaps the key is to look for a frameshift or a nonsense mutation. But in all the options, the mutations are substitutions, not indels, because the length is same as the intact.

So, perhaps one of the mutations leads to a premature stop codon, which would disrupt the gene.

Wait, let me look for any TAA, TAG, TGA in the mutant sequences before the end.

The intact gene has ... TGA at the end.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: The sequence is ...TGTGGATGAA... No TAA, TAG, etc. But wait, let me look at each one.

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking for a stop codon. Let's look at the codons:

ATG (M) TCT (S) ACG (Thr) GCT (A) GGT (Gly) TCT (S) TGT (C) GGA (G) TGA (Stop) ... Wait, wait, in Mutant1, the sequence is ...TGTCGC... and then ...TGA. Wait, the middle part is TGTGGATGAA... Wait, did I make a mistake. Let me parse the sequence.

Intact gene is:

ATG TTC TCG C G G TAC TT C TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA T TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant1 is:

ATG TCT ACG C G G TAC TT C TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA T TGC GC ... TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle.

Wait, in Mutant1, after the first few codons, is there a stop codon? Let's see.
