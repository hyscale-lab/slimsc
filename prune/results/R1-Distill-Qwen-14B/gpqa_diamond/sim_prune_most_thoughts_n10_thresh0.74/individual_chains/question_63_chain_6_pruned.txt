Okay, so I have this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

So, the molecule is diatomic, made of atoms X and Y. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The given data includes the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration.

Hmm, right. I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition between energy states. Since this is the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for vibration, which is the ground vibrational state, n=0. And when it absorbs a photon, it would probably go to the next higher state. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that would be the next state in the vibrational energy, which is the first excited vibrational state, n=1. Because for the same vibrational state, the rotational state can vary, but the next lowest energy in the molecule's state would involve the next vibrational level.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be the next vibrational state (n=1) with the same rotational state, or the same vibrational state but a higher rotational state. Oh, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So that would be the next higher vibrational state, because the vibrational energy is higher than rotational energy in the same state. So the photon would have to supply the energy difference between n=0 and n=1.

But wait, wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the energy levels. The total energy of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. Vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number. Rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number.

The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. To get the next lowest energy state
