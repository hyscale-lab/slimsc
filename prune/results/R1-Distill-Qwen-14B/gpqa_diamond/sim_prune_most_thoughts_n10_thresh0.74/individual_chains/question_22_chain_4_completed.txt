Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electrochemistry question, but I'm a bit rusty on my concepts. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant under different conditions. The statement is incomplete and we have to fill in the blanks with the correct terms from the options given.

The first part says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." The options for this blank are either 'weaker' or 'stronger.' The second part is about kinetic behavior in acidic solutions: "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions." This blank could be 'faster' or 'slower.'

I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidizing agent depends on its standard electrode potential. A higher (more positive) potential means it's a stronger oxidizing agent because it's more likely to gain electrons (be reduced). 

Oxygen's standard reduction potential varies with the solution's pH. Let me recall the standard potentials. In acidic solution, the O2 reduction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, and the E° is around +1.23 V. In basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, and the E° is higher, maybe around +0.40 V? Wait, wait—I think I might have those reversed. Or maybe I should think about it another way. 

Wait, no. Wait, the standard electrode potential for O2 in acidic solution is higher. Let me get this right. The more positive the E°, the more spontaneous the reaction. So in acidic conditions, O2 is a stronger oxidant because E° is higher. So in basic solutions, since O2's E° is lower than in acidic, it's a weaker oxidant? Or wait, no, maybe I have it backwards.

Wait, when comparing the same reaction under different conditions. Let me think about the Nernst equation. In basic conditions, without H+ ions, the reaction must adjust. So, for O2 in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O, E° = 1.23 V. In basic solution, H+ is low, so OH- is high. The reaction becomes O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-, and the E° is lower, like 0.40 V. So yes, in acidic, E° is higher, so O2 is a stronger oxidant there. 

But wait, the first part of the question is about basic solutions. So in basic solution, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic. Because a lower E° means it's less likely to be reduced, making it a weaker oxidizing agent. So the first blank should be 'weaker' because in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic conditions.

Now the second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts ... in acidic solutions. Kinetics is about the rate of reaction. The rate depends on factors like activation energy, concentration, and possibly the conditions affecting the reaction mechanism.

In acidic solutions, oxygen might react faster because the ions are more mobile. Alternatively, maybe in more acidic conditions, the reaction is easier to proceed because H+ can help in the reaction mechanism. Oh wait, but sometimes higher H+ can lead to better protonation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in acidic solution has a lower activation energy. Wait, I'm trying to remember about the kinetics of O2 reactions. I think that in acidic conditions, the O2 reaction can proceed more quickly because of the presence of H+ ions. Maybe the reaction involves H+ in the rate-determining step.

Wait, another approach: in acidic solution, the reaction of O2 might be more favorable thermodynamically, but how does that affect kinetics? Well, sometimes a more thermodynamically favorable reaction (higher E°, more products favored) doesn't necessarily mean it's faster. Kinetics and thermodynamics are separate. 

Wait, but O2 in acidic solutions has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidant. But for kinetics, perhaps the reaction is slower because the activation energy is higher. Or faster because the reaction is more exothermic, but that's about thermodynamics again. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the actual reactions. In acidic solution, O2 is reduced to water. The reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-.

Which reaction proceeds faster? I think the reaction in acidic solution might be faster because the H+ ions can act as catalysts or facilitate the electron transfer more efficiently. Alternatively, maybe the water is less of a hindrance in acidic conditions, making the reaction proceed more quickly.

Wait, but I remember that the rate of O2 reduction can depend on the pH. In acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed at a higher rate. So the kinetic part would be 'faster' in acidic solutions. So the second blank is 'faster.' 

Wait, another angle: the concentration of H+ in acidic solution is higher, which could increase the rate. Also, the reaction in acidic solution might have a lower activation energy because of the presence of H+ ions that can stabilize transition states or intermediates.

Putting it together: 

First part: Thermodynamically, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant (because E° is lower). So the first blank is 'weaker.'

Second part: Kinetically, in acidic solutions, O2 reacts faster. So the second blank is 'faster.'

Looking at the options, the combination would be 'weaker' and 'faster.' Let's see the options.

Option C: weaker – faster. Option C is 'weaker' and 'faster.' 

So the correct answer should be C.


The question involves analyzing the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant under different conditions, focusing on thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. 

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis**: The standard reduction potential of oxygen varies with the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the reduction reaction is \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \), with a higher standard electrode potential (\( E^\circ \)) of approximately \( +1.23 \, \text{V} \). In basic solutions, the reaction is \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), with a lower \( E^\circ \) of approximately \( +0.40 \, \text{V} \). A lower \( E^\circ \) in basic solutions means oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically in these conditions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis**: Kinetics depends on factors like activation energy and ion mobility. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can enhance ion mobility and facilitate the reaction mechanism, making the reaction proceed faster. Thus, oxygen reacts more quickly kinetically in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations:
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

The correct combination is "weaker – faster," which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
