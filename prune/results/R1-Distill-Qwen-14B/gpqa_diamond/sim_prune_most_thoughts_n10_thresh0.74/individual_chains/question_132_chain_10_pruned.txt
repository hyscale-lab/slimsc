Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an aromatic compound mixture giving certain NMR signals. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, for benzene derivatives, the formula CnH2n-6 applies. Let me check: C10H14 should be for a benzene ring with some substituents. Benzene is C6H6, so C10H14 would have (10-6)*2 + 6 = 10 H? Wait, no. Let me think again. The general formula for a mono-substituted benzene is C7H8. Each additional substituent adds a certain number of carbons and hydrogens. Alternatively, looking at the molecular formula, C10H14. Let me see: for a benzene ring with four substituents that are methyl groups, each methyl is CH3. So 4 methyl would add 4 carbons and 12 hydrogens (because each CH3 is 3 H, 4*3=12). Benzene is C6H6, so total would be C10H18. But our compound is C10H14. Oh wait, perhaps not all substituents are methyl. Because 4 methyl groups would give C10, but H would be 6 + 12 = 18. But the given is H14, which is 4 less. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong.

Wait, maybe the substituents are not all methyl. Let me see the options. The options include tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzenes. Let me check the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That would be four methyl groups. So formula would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) â†’ C10H14? Because each methyl adds a C and 3 H. Benzene is C6H6, so 4 methyl groups would add 4 C (C6 +4 = C10) and 4*3 H =12 H. So total H is 6 +
