Okay, so I've got this problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says: The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees. The galaxy is at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, with various exponents.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, another version I've seen is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 G ħ), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Either way, A is crucial here.

So to find the entropy, I need to find the area of the event horizon. The event horizon's radius is the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = (2 G M)/c². So the area A would be 4π R_s².

But wait, I don't have the mass M. Instead, I have the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh right, because θ is the angle subtended by the event horizon at distance d. So we can use that to find the size of the event horizon.

When an object of size l is at a distance d, the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately θ ≈ l/d, assuming θ is small. Since θ here is 1e-17 degrees, that's a very small angle, so this approximation should hold.

First, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. Because in radians, 180 degrees is π radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180).

θ_deg is 1e-17, so θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that: π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416/(180) is about 0.01745. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, wait, actually, 1 degree is π/180 radians, so 1e-17 degrees is (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ l/d → l = θ * d.

But wait, what is d here? It's given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert parsecs to meters to be consistent with SI units.

1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So l = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m.

Let me compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 * 3.086 = about 5.38e7 (since 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7). Wait, 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.38. So 5.38e7 meters. So l ≈ 5.38e7 meters.

Wait, no. Wait, 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e( -19 + 26 ) = 5.38 * 1e7 = 5.38e7 meters. Yes, so the size l is about 5.38e7 meters. But wait, l is the diameter of the event horizon or the radius? Hmm, I think θ is the angular size, which is the diameter divided by the distance. So l is the diameter of the event horizon.

Wait, no. Wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c^2. The event horizon is a sphere with radius R_s. So the diameter would be 2 R_s. So when we calculate l as θ * d, that's the diameter, because for a sphere, the angular size is determined by the diameter. So l = 2 R_s = θ * d → R_s = (θ * d)/2.

Wait, no, I think the formula θ ≈ l/d is when l is the length of the object as seen from the observer. In the case of the event horizon, which is a sphere, the length would be the diameter, because that's the maximum extent. So l = 2 R_s. So yes, R_s = l/2 = (θ * d)/2.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d)/2.

Wait, so with θ_rad being 1.745e-19 radians, and d = 3.086e26 m. Let's compute R_s:

R_s = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2.

So let's compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e( -19 + 26 ) = 5.38 * 1e7 = 5.38e7 meters.

Then, R_s = 5.38e7 m / 2 ≈ 2.69e7 meters.

Wait, so R_s is about 2.69e7 meters. Does that make sense? Let me check: a supermassive black hole. Oh wait, the Schwarzschild radius for the Milky Way's SMBH is about 1e6 km, which is 1e9 meters. Wait, 1e6 km is 1e9 meters. So wait, 2.69e7 meters is about 26.9 million meters, which is 26,900 km. That seems a bit smaller than expected for a supermassive, but perhaps this is a smaller one? Or perhaps my calculations have a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculations.

Let me compute θ_rad again. θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180) = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1e-17 * 0.017453 ≈ 1.7453e-19 radians.

Distance d = 1e10 parsecs.

1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So θ_rad * d = 1.7453e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m = (1.7453 * 3.0857) * 1e( -19 + 26 ) = (5.38) * 1e7 m ≈ 5.38e7 meters. That's the diameter, so radius R_s is 5.38e7 / 2 ≈ 2.69e7 meters. Hmm, that's 2.69e7 m = 26,900,000 meters = 26,900 km. So the Schwarzschild radius is about 26,900 km. Let me compare to known supermassive black holes. The Milky Way's Sag A* is about 2e6 km (2 million km) radius. Oh, wait, 26,900 km is way smaller than that. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Wait, 10^10 parsecs is 1e10 pc. That's a very large distance. So perhaps the angular size is so small that the actual size is manageable.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recompute θ_rad * d.

θ_rad is 1.7453e-19 radians.

Distance d is 3.0857e26 meters.

1.7453e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.7453 * 3.0857) * 1e( -19 + 26 ) = about 5.38 * 1e7 = 5.38e7 meters. So that's the diameter, so radius is 5.38e7 / 2 = 2.69e7 meters.

Wait, 2.69e7 meters is 26,900 km, which is about the radius of the event horizon. Hmm, but for a supermassive black hole, I thought they're much larger. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the distance is 1e10 parsecs, which is 10 billion parsecs. That's about 33 billion light-years away, right? Because 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years, so 1e10 parsecs is about 32.6 billion light-years. So that's a very large distance, so the object must be very large to have a noticeable angular size. Wait, but the angular size is 1e-17 degrees, which is a really tiny angle. So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but if R_s is 2.69e7 meters, that's about 26,900 km. Let me compute the mass M using R_s = 2 G M / c^2.

Rearranging, M = (R_s c^2)/(2 G).

Given that R_s is 2.69e7 m, c is 3e8 m/s, G is 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So M = (2.69e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 2.69e7 * (9e16) = 2.69e7 * 9e16 = 2.421e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

So M = (2.421e24) / (1.3348e-10) ) = 2.421e24 / 1.3348e-10 = approx 1.815e34 kg.

Wait, that's 1.8e34 kg. Let me think, the Sun's mass is about 2e30 kg. So 1.8e34 kg is 1e4 times larger, so 1e4 solar masses. Hmm, that's a stellar mass black hole, not supermassive. But the problem says it's a supermassive black hole, which is millions to billions of solar masses. So this suggests that either my calculation is wrong, or perhaps the given angular size is for a much larger distance or a much larger object.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me double-check the calculation for M.

M = (R_s * c²) / (2 G )

R_s = 2.69e7 m.

c^2 = (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

2 G = 2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

So numerator: 2.69e7 * 9e16 = ?

Let me compute 2.69e7 * 9e16.

2.69e7 = 2.69 * 1e7.

9e16 = 9 * 1e16.

Multiply 2.69 *9: approx 24.21.

Then exponents: 1e7 *1e16 = 1e23.

So total numerator: 24.21e23 = 2.421e24.

Denominator: 1.3348e-10.

So M = 2.421e24 / 1.3348e-10 = (2.421 / 1.3348) * 1e(24 +10) ) → 2.421 / 1.3348 ≈ 1.815.

So 1.815e34 kg.

Wait, 1e34 kg is 1e4 solar masses (since Sun is ~2e30 kg). So that's only 1e4 solar masses, which is a big black hole, but not supermassive. Supermassive are millions to billions of solar masses. So either I messed up the calculation, or perhaps the problem is designed that way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R_s.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of R_s.

θ_deg = 1e-17 → θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 rad.

d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m.

l = θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) = 1.745 *3.086 = approx 5.38 as I did before, so 5.38e7 m. Wait, that's the diameter. So R_s is half of that, 2.69e7 m.

So that part seems correct. So M is approximately 1.8e34 kg. Hmm.

But let's proceed. So now, the area A is 4 π R_s².

R_s is 2.69e7 m, so R_s squared is (2.69e7)^2 = approx (2.7e7)^2 = 7.29e14 m².

Multiply by 4 π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566.

So A ≈ 12.566 * 7.29e14 ≈ 9.16e15 m².

Now, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B).

Wait, let me check the formula. I think I might have missed a factor. The formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G ). Or wait, another way: S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (kB), where l_p is the Planck length. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, the formula is S = ( (A) ) * (1/(4 l_p^2)) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length.

But perhaps it's easier to substitute all constants and compute numerically.

Constants:

c = 3e8 m/s.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

k_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute A: 4 π R_s².

We have R_s = 2.69e7 m, so R_s² = (2.69e7)^2 = approx 7.236e14 m².

A = 4 * π * 7.236e14 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 7.236e14 ≈ 12.566 * 7.236e14 ≈ 9.1e15 m².

Now, S = (A c^3 )/(4 G ħ k_B )

Wait, no, let me get the formula correct. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:

S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B )

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Let me check.

Wait, correct formula:

S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure.

The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) ) * (1/(4 π)) ?

Wait, no. Alternatively, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * k_B, where l_p is Planck length. Since l_p = sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ), so l_p squared is G ħ / c^3.

Wait, Planck area is l_p squared. So A/(4 l_p^2) gives the entropy in terms of k_B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for the correct formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is given by:

S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G )

Wait, let me confirm: The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B )? No, wait, maybe it's (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) ) * (1/k_B), since units have to be in J/K.

Wait, the units: entropy S is in J/K.

So let's see: A is m².

c^3 is (m/s)^3.

G is m^3 kg^-1 s^-2.

ħ is J s = kg m² s^-1.

So putting it together:

(A c^3) / (4 G ħ )

Units:

(m²) * (m^3/s^3) ) → m^5 / s^3.

Denominator: G has m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. ħ is kg m² s^-1.

So denominator units: (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (kg m² s^-1) ) → (m^3 * kg^-1 * s^-2) * (kg m^2 s^-1 ) ) → m^5 s^-3.

So overall, numerator over denominator gives (m^5/s^3) ) / (m^5 s^-3) ) → dimensionless. So to get J/K, we have to multiply by k_B, which is J/K per something. Wait, no, because the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) ) * (k_B) ?

Wait, no, let me think again. If the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ) ) * (1/(k_B)) ), then the units would be:

(A c^3) has units (m²)(m³/s³) ) → m^5/s^3.

Divided by (4 G ħ ) → ( m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 ) * ( kg m^2 s^-1 ) ) → m^5 kg^-1 s^-3.

So (A c^3) / (4 G ħ ) → (m^5/s^3) ) / (m^5 kg^-1 s^-3) ) → kg. So that gives kg. Then, multiplied by k_B (which is J/K ), J is kg m²/s².

So kg * ( kg m²/s² ) / K → kg² m²/(s² K ), which isn't correct. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 G ħ k_B).

Wait, let me compute the units for that formula.

A (m²) * c^3 (m^3/s^3) → m^5/s^3.

Denominator: 4 G (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) ) * ħ (J s) → (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (kg m^2 s^-1 * s ) → (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) * (kg m^2 s^0 ) → m^5 s^-2.

So numerator is m^5/s^3, denominator is m^5 s^-2 → (m^5/s^3) )/(m^5 s^-2 ) ) = s^(-1).

Multiply by k_B (J/K ) → (s^-1) * (kg m^2 / s^2 K ) ) → kg m² s^-3 K^-1.

But entropy S has units J/K → kg m^2 / s^2 K.

Hmm, this doesn't match. So perhaps the formula is missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B), where l_p is the Planck length.

Planck length l_p = sqrt( G ħ / c^3 ) → units sqrt( m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * kg m^2 s^-1 ) / m^3/s^3 ) → wait, let's compute l_p^2.

l_p^2 = (G ħ )/(c^3).

So l_p^2 has units (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 * kg m^2 s^-1 ) ) / (m^3/s^3 ) → ( m^5 s^-3 ) ) / ( m^3 s^-3 ) ) → m^2.

So A/(4 l_p^2) is (m²)/(m²) → dimensionless. So when multiplied by k_B (J/K ), we get J/K as the unit for S. That makes sense.

So, S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * k_B.

So let me compute that.

First, compute l_p^2 = (G ħ )/(c^3) → compute each value.

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So l_p^2 = (6.6743e-11 * 1.0545718e-34 ) / ( (3e8)^3 )

Compute numerator: 6.6743e-11 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 7.04e-45.

Denominator: (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25.

So l_p^2 ≈ (7.04e-45) / (2.7e25) ) ≈ 2.607e-70 m².

So A/(4 l_p^2 ) = (9.16e15 m²) / (4 * 2.607e-70 m² ) → (9.16e15) / (1.0428e-69 ) → approx 8.79e84.

Multiply by k_B (1.38e-23 J/K):

S = 8.79e84 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 1.213e62 J/K.

So the entropy is approximately 1e62 J/K.

Looking at the options, option A is 1e62, option B is 1e59, etc. So the correct answer should be A) 1e62 J/K.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation again for possible errors.

Compute l_p^2 again:

G = 6.6743e-11,

ħ = 1.0545718e-34,

G * ħ = 6.6743e-11 * 1.0545718e-34 ≈ let me calculate 6.6743 * 1.0545718 ≈ 7.04, so 7.04e-45.

c^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So l_p^2 = (7.04e-45) / (2.7e25) ) = approx 2.607e-70 m².

A = 9.16e15 m².

So A/(4 l_p^2) = 9.16e15 / (4 * 2.607e-70) ) → 9.16e15 / 1.0428e-69 = 9.16e15 * 9.6e68 ≈ (9.16 * 9.6) e(15 +68) → approx 88.3 e83 → 8.83e84.

Multiply by k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K: 8.83e84 * 1.38e-23 = (8.83 *1.38) e(84-23) → approx 12.18 e61 → 1.218e62 J/K.

So that's about 1e62, which matches option A.

Therefore, the order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}
\]

where \( A \) is the area of the event horizon, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, and \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant. The area \( A \) is related to the Schwarzschild radius \( R_s \) of the black hole:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2
\]

The Schwarzschild radius is given by:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}
\]

However, we are not directly given the mass \( M \). Instead, we are provided with the angular size \( \theta = 10^{-17} \, \text{degrees} \) and the distance \( d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \). Using the small-angle approximation, the angular size relates to the diameter of the event horizon as:

\[
\theta \approx \frac{l}{d} \quad \text{(in radians)}
\]

where \( l \) is the diameter of the event horizon. Converting \( \theta \) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta_{\text{deg}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The distance \( d \) is converted from parsecs to meters:

\[
d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} \cdot 3.086 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}.
\]

The diameter of the event horizon is then:

\[
l = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.38 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The Schwarzschild radius is half the diameter:

\[
R_s = \frac{l}{2} = \frac{5.38 \times 10^7}{2} \approx 2.69 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (2.69 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 4 \pi (7.236 \times 10^{14}) \approx 9.16 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Substituting \( A \) into the entropy formula, we use the constants:

\[
c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}, \quad G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}, \quad \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s}, \quad k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

The entropy is:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 G \hbar k_B}.
\]

First, compute \( c^3 \):

\[
c^3 = (3 \times 10^8)^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{24} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^3.
\]

Now substitute all values:

\[
S = \frac{(9.16 \times 10^{15}) (2.7 \times 10^{24})}{4 (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (1.380649 \times 10^{-23})}.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
4 G \hbar k_B = 4 (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 3.81 \times 10^{-69}.
\]

The numerator is:

\[
A c^3 = (9.16 \times 10^{15}) (2.7 \times 10^{24}) \approx 2.47 \times 10^{39}.
\]

Thus:

\[
S = \frac{2.47 \times 10^{39}}{3.81 \times 10^{-69}} \approx 6.5 \times 10^{107}.
\]

However, this result is inconsistent with the expected order of magnitude for black hole entropy. To correct this, we use the Planck area \( l_p^2 = G \hbar / c^3 \), which simplifies the formula to:

\[
S = \frac{A}{4 l_p^2} k_B.
\]

The Planck area is:

\[
l_p^2 = \frac{G \hbar}{c^3} = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11}) (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})}{(3 \times 10^8)^3} \approx 2.607 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Now compute \( A / (4 l_p^2) \):

\[
\frac{A}{4 l_p^2} = \frac{9.16 \times 10^{15}}{4 (2.607 \times 10^{-70})} \approx 8.79 \times 10^{84}.
\]

Finally, multiply by \( k_B \):

\[
S = (8.79 \times 10^{84}) (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 1.21 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

Thus, the entropy of the black hole is approximately \( 10^{62} \, \text{J/K} \).

**Answer: A**
