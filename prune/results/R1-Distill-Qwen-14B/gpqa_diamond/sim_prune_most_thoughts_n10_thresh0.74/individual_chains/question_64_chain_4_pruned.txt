Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again and jot down the key points.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air, meaning it's probably an inert environment, maybe with no oxygen. When heated, it forms a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes.

Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Anhydrous magnesium perchlorate is a strong drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. So maybe the gas here was water vapor, which got absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2.

Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Hmm, so if the gas was CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 and increase the weight. Since it didn't change, maybe there was no CO2? Or maybe another gas isn't reacting here.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper probably reacts with a gas that can oxidize it. Common oxidizing gases are O2, Cl2, maybe SO3? But wait, if the gas passed through tube 1 first, which would have absorbed water. So what gas would react with copper? Maybe H2S? Or maybe SO2? Wait, SO2 is a gas that could react with copper at high temperatures. Let me think: when SO2 is passed over hot copper, does it react? Alternatively, maybe it's HCl? But HCl would not react with copper unless in presence of something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. But wait, O2 wouldn't increase the weight of the copper tube unless it's causing oxidation, but O2 in the presence of moisture might form something else.

Wait, but the tube is red-hot copper. When SO2 is passed over hot copper, it can form CuS, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S. No, H2S is a gas but would it react with copper? If the gas is H2S and the copper is hot, perhaps they react. Hmm, but I'm not certain about the reaction here. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. But if O2 is present, it would react with the copper, forming CuO. But then why isn't there a significant increase? The increase is 0.80g. Let's think about the moles of CuO formed.

The last part says that after passing through all the tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Let me try to figure out what each gas is.

So the initial heating of salts A and B produced some gases. Let's say the salts decomposed. Let me think about possible salt decompositions. For example, nitrates decompose to give NO2 or other oxides, but without air, maybe it's a decomposition that produces water, ammonia, or other gases.

Wait, the gas mixture is passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. It would absorb any water vapor. So if gas 1 is water vapor, it would be absorbed here, increasing the weight of tube 1 by 3.60g. So that suggests 3.60g of H2O was absorbed. Let me calculate the moles of H2O here.

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.60g /18 g/mol = 0.2 mol H2O.

So, 0.2 moles of H2O were removed. So the initial gas mixture had 0.2 moles H2O.

Next, the gas passes through Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas was CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, which would increase the tube's weight. But since the weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present. Alternatively, maybe the gas that passed through was something else that doesn't react with Ca(OH)2. Like NH3? Or perhaps N2, O2, etc. Wait, but NH3 would be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2? Or maybe not. Let me think: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, but I'm not sure if it reacts with NH3. So maybe after water is removed, the gas goes to the Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas didn't react, it's probably not CO2, which would have reacted.

Wait
