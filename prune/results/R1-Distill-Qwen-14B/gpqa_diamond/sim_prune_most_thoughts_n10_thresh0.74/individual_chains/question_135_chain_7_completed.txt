Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me think through this step by step. 

The problem is about the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψ(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Maybe it's supposed to represent a term where the boson X couples to fermions. Like, maybe it's a Yukawa interaction or something similar. 

So in the Lagrangian, I see that X is interacting with fermions ψ. The mass term would come from the υ part, but the interaction term is λ times the fermion fields times X. So the coupling is between X and the fermions. 

The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decay channels for X at the lowest order. So, I need to think about what particles X can decay into. 

In particle physics, a boson can decay into fermions if the fermion mass is less than half the boson mass. Because in decay processes, energy and momentum conservation require that the total energy of the decay products is less than the mass of the parent particle. 

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. For each possible fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion in the pair will have a mass, so the total is twice that mass (since they're a pair, like a particle and its antiparticle). 

What are the known fermion masses? Let me list them roughly. 

The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. Up quark is about 2.2 MeV, down is about 4.7 MeV. So 2m_u ≈ 4.4 MeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. Same for down. 

The strange quark is heavier, about 95 MeV. So 2m_s is about 190 MeV. Also way under 6 GeV. 

The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV. 2m_c is about 3 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so X can decay into c cbar. 

The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b and bbar. 

The top quark is way heavier, like 173 GeV, so X can't decay into that either. 

What about leptons? The electron is about 0.5 MeV, so 2m_e is negligible. The muon is about 0.1 GeV, so 2m_mu is about 0.2 GeV, which is way under 6. The tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so tau pairs are allowed. 

So possible fermion pairs would be those with masses less than 3 GeV each. So for quarks, that's u, d, s, and c. But wait, I thought that the bottom quark is too heavy. So for quarks, possible are u, d, s, c. 

But looking at the options, option A has b and s, etc. Oh wait, no, I thought that X can't decay into b because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is above 6 GeV. So any decay into b's is not allowed. So which options include b? Let me check the options.

Option A includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. But since b's mass is too high, those decays would be forbidden. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Wait, the tau and mu e are included. So the quarks are c (3 GeV, 2m is 3 GeV), which is allowed. The s is 95 MeV, so 2m is 190, allowed. Same for u and d. The leptons: tau is 1.77 GeV, so 2m_t is about 3.5 GeV, allowed. Mu and e are even lighter. So option B seems to have allowed particles. 

Option C includes t quark. But 2m_t is way above 6 GeV, so that's not allowed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but what about the tau and mu pairs? The tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is well under 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Similarly, mu pairs: 2m_mu is about 0.2 GeV, so that's allowed. 

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

- u and ū
- d and d̄
- s and s̄
- c and c̄
- tau+ tau-
- mu+ mu-
- e+ e-

Wait, but in the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct. 

Wait a second, but the Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψ(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). I'm not entirely sure, but I think that the interaction term is something like X ψ ψ, which would allow X to decay into two fermions, like ψ and ψ̄. So, for each fermion species, if the mass is less than 3 GeV, their pair can be produced.

So the possible fermion pairs are those with masses less than 3 GeV. 

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e, mu, tau: 0.5 MeV, 0.1 GeV, 1.77 GeV. 2m_tau is 3.54 GeV <6 GeV, allowed.

Quarks:

- u: ~2 MeV -> 4 MeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

- d: ~5 MeV -> 10 MeV <6 GeV.

- s: ~95 MeV -> ~190 MeV <6 GeV.

- c: ~1.5 GeV -> 3 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

- b: ~4.5 GeV -> 9 GeV >6 GeV. Not allowed.

- t: way too heavy.

So the allowed decay products are u, d, s, c quarks, and leptons e, mu, tau.

So the possible decays are X→ uū, dī, sī, c c̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says X→ c c̄, sī, uū, dī, tau, mu, e. Which matches.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the fermion pair is less than or equal to 6 GeV. This is derived from energy and momentum conservation principles in particle decays.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses and Decay Limits**:
   - For a fermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the total mass is \( 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion. This must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - The masses of known fermions are:
     - Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \sim 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \sim 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \sim 190 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (exceeds 6 GeV, not allowed).
     - Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (far exceeds 6 GeV, not allowed).
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \sim 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Tau lepton (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Allowed Decays**:
   - From the above, the allowed fermion pairs are:
     - \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( c \bar{c} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \).
   - Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden due to their masses exceeding 6 GeV.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
