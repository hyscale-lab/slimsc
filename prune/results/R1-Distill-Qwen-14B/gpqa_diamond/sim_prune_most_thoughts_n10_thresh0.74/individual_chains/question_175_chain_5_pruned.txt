Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says we've got an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on lambda.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the power radiated depends on the frequency and the angle. Also, in the radiation zone (which is far from the source), the fields behave like plane waves.

Wait, what about the dipole radiation? I think dipole radiation has a specific dependence on the angle. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum along the axis (theta=0) and decreases as you move to the equator (theta=90 degrees). The intensity (power per unit solid angle per unit frequency) for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta))/2. But wait, that's for the intensity in the far field. So at theta=0 (along the axis), the intensity is maximum. At theta=90, it's zero because all the power is along the axis.

Wait, but the question is about the power fraction. So the maximum power is A, which I think is the total power emitted. Or wait, no. A is the maximum power radiated at some angle, perhaps at theta=0. Because, if the function f is the power per unit solid angle, then the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles. But the question says the maximum power is A. So maybe A is the maximum value of f, or the maximum over all angles. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's read the question again. The maximum power thus radiated is A. So that probably means the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle is A. Wait, no, that might not make sense. Wait, power per unit solid angle is the intensity. The maximum intensity is A. Or is it that the total power is A, and the fraction of that at theta=30 degrees is to be found?

Wait, the problem says: "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So A is the maximum, and the fraction is the ratio of the power at theta=30 to A. So if the maximum power is at some angle, say theta=0 or another angle, I need to find the value of f(theta=30) divided by the maximum f
