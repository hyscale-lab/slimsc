Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then there are several steps, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

Let me break down each step. First, the starting material. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene, which I think is like norbornene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the molecule has an oxygen ring at that position, right?

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I remember that when you have dibromomethyl groups and NaI, it's a typical nucleophilic substitution, probably an SN2 reaction. Wait, but wait, the compound is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So, each of those positions has a Br attached to a CH2 group.

So, when NaI is present, I- is a good nucleophile. It would substitute the Br in the dibromomethyl groups. Each of those groups would react twice, right? Because each CH2Br2 would undergo substitution twice. Wait, no, each dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, so each has two Br atoms. So when NaI is added, each of those CH2Br2 groups would substitute both Brs with I-. So each would become CH2I2. So, the product after this step would have two cyclohexadiene rings with two iodomethyl groups each. But wait, the initial structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, each of those two positions (5 and 6) has a CH2Br2 group. When each reacts with NaI, each Br would be replaced by I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2. So, the product after this first reaction would have two cyclohex
