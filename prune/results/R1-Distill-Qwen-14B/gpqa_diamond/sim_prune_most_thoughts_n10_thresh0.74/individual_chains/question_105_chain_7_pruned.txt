Okay, so I have this question about stars with spots and how they affect the observed brightness over time. I remember that when a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in the brightness. This is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front of a star causes a drop in brightness when observed from Earth. So the problem is asking me to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

Let me read the question again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the observed brightness dip.

The question says that if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would make the same amplitude in the light curve. So I need to compare the brightness variation due to the spots to that of a planet transit.

First, I think about how the brightness variation is calculated. For a planet transit, the change in brightness (ΔF) is given by the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is ΔF = (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks that area, so the dip is proportional to the square of the ratio.

But for the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler regions, so when they rotate into view, the observed brightness decreases because those cooler, darker areas are now visible. The overall brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

Wait, the formula for the observed flux from a star with spots would involve the temperature difference. The star's total flux without spots is F = σTeff^4. When a spot is visible, it contributes F_spot = σ(Teff - ΔT)^4 * area, but actually, the spots are cooler, so their flux is less than the surrounding. So the change in flux is the difference between the unspotted flux and the spotted part.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the fractional change in flux. So the unspotted flux is F0 = σTeff^4 * A_total, where A_total is the star's surface area. When a spot is visible, it's F = F0 - (F_spot), where F_spot is the flux from the spot. Alternatively, since the spot is cooler, the flux from that area is lower.

Wait, the spot's flux is (T_spot)^4 times the area, and the surrounding is (Teff)^4. So the total flux when the spot is visible is F_total = (Teff^4 * (A - A_spots) ) + (T_spot^4 * A_spots) ), where A is the total surface area of the star, and A_spots is the area of the spots.

The fractional change in flux would be (F_total - F0) / F0. Let me compute this.

F0 = σTeff^4 * A

F_total = σ [ (Teff^4) (A - A_spots)
