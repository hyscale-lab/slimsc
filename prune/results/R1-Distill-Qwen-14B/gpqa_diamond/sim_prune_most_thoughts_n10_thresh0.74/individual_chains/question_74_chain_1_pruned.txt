Okay, so I have this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We have an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no, wait. The next 150 minutes from when? Oh, the question says that 50 minutes have already passed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes? Or is the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes in? Hmm, I think it's the latter. So the total time is 100 minutes, but 50 have passed, so the remaining is 50 minutes. Wait no, the question says so far 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking at the next 150 minutes. Oh, so the time from now is 150 minutes more.

Wait, but radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay probability depends on the time elapsed. I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The decay process is memoryless, so the probability doesn't depend on how long it has been since the last decay. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't affect the future probability. Or wait, no, the problem is about the probability of decay within a certain time frame.

Wait, but the given probability
