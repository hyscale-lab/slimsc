Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when an acid is neutralized by a base, usually measured in kJ/mol. But wait, sometimes it's per mole of H+ or OH- reacting.

First, I think I need to figure out the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4.
H2SO4 is a strong acid and a diprotic acid. Each mole gives 2 moles of H+.
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.
So, H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Let's see:

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-.
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles.
So, OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Total H+ available: 0.28 moles.
Total OH- available: 0.2 moles.

So, the OH- is the limiting reactant. Because 0.2 is
