Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as mu = gamma * S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After this change, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of this average.

Hmm. So I need to find the frequency at which the expectation value of S_z oscillates after the magnetic field is switched from Z to Y.

Let me think about what's happening here. The particle is a spin-1/2, so it can be in either an up or down state relative to the magnetic field direction. Initially, the field is along Z, so the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_z. Then the field is turned off, but wait, that might not be the case. Oh, wait the magnetic field is turned off, but another is turned on along Y. So the initial field is B along Z, and after the switch, it's B along Y.

Wait, but how does the magnetic moment relate to the spin? Oh, the magnetic moment mu is gamma times the spin component S_z. So the Hamiltonian for the system when a magnetic field is applied is H = -mu·B. Since mu is along the direction of B, that would be H = -gamma * S_z * B.

Wait, no, actually, the standard formula is that the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. So the magnetic moment vector is mu = gamma * S. Then the energy (Hamiltonian) is H = -mu · B. If B is along the z-direction, H = -gamma B S_z. Similarly, if B is along the y-direction, H = -gamma B S_y.

So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z because the magnetic field is along Z. Then the field is suddenly turned off and turned on in the Y direction. So the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously because the Hamiltonian is abruptly changed. So the state before and after the change is |+z>, which is the eigenstate of S_z.

But now, under the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to S_y, the state will evolve over time. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate because the state will precess around the Y-axis. So I need to find the time dependence of <S_z> and determine the oscillation frequency.

Let me think about the time evolution. The initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +1/2 (in units where ħ=1, but wait, spin matrices are usually in terms of ħ/2). Let me clarify the spin matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operators are S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So the magnetic moment mu = gamma * S would be mu = gamma * (ħ/2) σ. But in the problem statement, mu is given as gamma * S_z. Wait, the question says mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that's a bit different. So perhaps mu is proportional only to the z-component of spin. But that's a bit unusual because typically the magnetic moment is proportional to the entire spin vector. But the question states mu = gamma * S_z. So I need to go with that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misread that. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. So the vector mu is aligned along the z-direction. But when the magnetic field is applied along Y, the Hamiltonian would be H = -mu · B. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma * S_z * B_y. Wait, no, because mu is a vector. So the dot product of mu
