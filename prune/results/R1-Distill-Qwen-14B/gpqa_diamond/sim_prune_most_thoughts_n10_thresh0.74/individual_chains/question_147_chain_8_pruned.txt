Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles, like protons and antiprotons, right? So the reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. 

Wait, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they usually convert into other particles. But here, it's producing two A⁺ and two A⁻. So maybe I should think about conservation laws—like conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I guess that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but the antiproton's rest mass is the same as the proton's, which is about 938 MeV/c². So the proton and antiproton each have rest energy of around 938 MeV. That's much higher than the 300 MeV stated for A. So when they annihilate, the combined rest energy is 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV, but the product particles have much less rest energy. That suggests that the process is happening with a lot of kinetic energy involved.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe the initial kinetic energy isn't too high. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the
