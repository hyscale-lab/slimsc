Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some immune response. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my immunology, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave them to mice orally. In the stomach, some of the GFP fluorescence was destroyed by acid. Others got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they looked at the Peyer's patches, isolated the proliferating cells, and sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability.

The question is about which process is happening. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Wait, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're involved in sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So the rotavirus proteins would be processed here.

When they tag the capsid proteins, those would probably be the antigens that the immune system responds to. But some were destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so maybe only a few of these tagged proteins make it through to the intestines. Then, the ones that do get stuck in the mucus, which is a barrier, so maybe they have to be processed by the immune cells in the Peyer's patches.

The variable heavy chain gene variabilityâ€”variable regions are part of the B cell receptors, right? Each B cell has a unique variable region, which allows for a wide range of antigen recognition.

So what processes change the variable regions? Somatic hypermutation comes to mind. That's during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutation in the variable regions to increase diversity and affinity for antigens. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, which is where B cells proliferate and differentiate. So when they isolate the proliferating cells, which are probably B cells, and see high variability, that suggests somatic hypermutation is happening.

Other options: Complement activation (B) is part of the innate immune response, but it doesn't directly lead to variability in B cell receptors. Class switching (C) is about changing the type of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't change the variable regions. VDJ recombination (D) is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. But that happens earlier, during maturation, not in response to a specific antigen.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chains after exposure to the antigen must be due to somatic hypermutation. That's process A.


The question involves understanding the immune response to rotavirus capsid proteins tagged with GFP in mice. The setup describes how some of the tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and play a key role in sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating cells suggests a process that increases diversity in the B cell receptor repertoire. Among the options provided:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to enhance antigen recognition and affinity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the type of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. However, this process happens earlier in B cell maturation and is not triggered by antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in response to specific antigens and increases the diversity of B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
