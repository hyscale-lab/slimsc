Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can rotate and vibrate, so their energy states are a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. The question is about the momentum a photon should have to make the molecule switch to the next lowest energy state. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next state. But which state? Oh, wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the first excited state?

Let me think. The molecule is modeled with rotation-vibration, so the energy levels involve both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So if it's in the fundamental state, what's the next possible state? I think the molecule can either go to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Since vibrational energy levels are quantized more and higher than rotational levels, maybe the lowest energy increase comes from a vibrational transition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the next state is the next rotational state, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which allows for rotation but perhaps not vibration? Or wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both. Oh, right, the rigid rotor model is purely rotational, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally influenced) rotor would have the bond length changing, so maybe that's part of the vibrational aspect.

Wait, the problem gives me the angular frequency of vibration, w =4e14 rad/s. So the molecule has vibrational modes. The energy levels for vibration are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I), with I the moment of inertia.

So the molecule's total energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational. The fundamental state would be n=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). So the energy is E = (0 + 1/2)hw + 0 (since J=0, the rotational energy is 0). 

Now, when it absorbs a photon, it's going to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. But what's the next state? Well, the next higher energy state could be either increasing J (rotational excitation) or increasing n (vibrational excitation). Which requires less energy? Because the question is about the momentum of the photon, which relates to the energy via E=pc, but wait, wait. Momentum p is related to energy and mass via E²=(pc)² + (mc²)². But for a photon, the rest mass is zero, so E=pc. So the momentum p is E/c.

But first, I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state. The current state is n=0, J=0. The next state could be either:

1. n=0, J=1 (next rotational state)
2. n=1, J=0 (next vibrational state)

Which of these has a lower energy difference? Because the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, wait, no, the next state would be the one with the least energy required. So whichever transition requires less energy is the one that would be the next possible.

Wait, the energy difference for vibrational transition (n=0→1) is ΔE_vib = [ (1 + ½) - (0 + ½) ] h w = 1 * h w. For rotational transition (J=0→1), the rotational energy difference is E_rot = B [ J (J+1) - (J-1) J ] = B [ (2J +1) ] for each step. So for J=0→1, it's B*(1*(1+1) - 0) )= B*2.

So which is smaller: 2B or h w?

I need to find B in terms of given data. B is the rotational constant, which is (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I is given by μ r², with μ the reduced mass, r the bond length.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) = (40/22) amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I should convert amu into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let me calculate that. 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.02, so 3.02e-27 kg. Wait, precise calculation:

1.818 * 1.6605 = 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605) )= approx 2.9889 + 0.0299 ≈ 3.0188. So μ ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now, B is (ħ²)/(2I). ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² is h²/(4π²).

So B = ( (h²)/(4 π²) ) / (2 I ) = h²/(8 π² I )

Plugging in the numbers:

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

I = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² I ≈ 8*(9.8696) * 1.2075e-46 ≈ 8*9.8696=78.9568; 78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 ≈ approx 95.33e-46 = 9.533e-45.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (9.533e-45) ≈ 4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute denominator: 8 * pi^2 is approximately 8*(9.8696) = 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2075e-46 = ?

78.9568 * 1.2075 = let's compute 78 *1.2=93.6, but more precisely:

78.9568 * 1.2075.

Let me compute 78.9568 *1 =78.9568

78.9568 *0.2=15.79136

78.9568 *0.0075=0.592176

Adding up: 78.9568 +15.79136=94.74816 +0.592176=95.340336.

So denominator is 95.340336e-46 kg m².

Now, h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = let's compute:

6.626e-34 *6.626e-34 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626 squared is approximately 43.90 (since 6^2=36, 6.6^2=43.56, 6.626^2=43.90 approximately).

So h² ≈ 43.90e-68 J² s².

So B = 43.90e-68 / 95.340336e-46 = (43.90 /95.340336) * 1e-22.

43.90 /95.34 ≈ ~0.460.

So B≈ 0.460e-22 J → 4.60e-23 J.

Wait, 0.46e-22 is the same as 4.6e-23 J.

So B is approximately 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference when J=0→1 is ΔE_rot = B*(J=1)(J+1=2) - B*(0)(1) = B*(2) = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

The vibrational energy difference when n=0→1 is ΔE_vib = h w = h *4e14 rad/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, so ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two energy differences: ΔE_rot=9.2e-23 J, ΔE_vib=2.65e-19 J.

Since 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 2.65e-19, the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the molecule would first transition to the next rotational state (J=1, n=0) when it absorbs a photon of energy 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state'. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is usually the state with the lowest vibrational (n=0) and rotational (J=0) energy. So, the next possible state with the lowest energy would be the next allowed state, which could be either J=1, n=0 or J=0, n=1.

But which of these is lower in energy? The rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 would be a lower energy change than the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1. So the photon required for the rotational transition has lower energy.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

So the energy E_photon = ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

Since for a photon, E=pc, so p=E/c.

c is the speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.0666e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the units are N·s, which is kg·m/s. So 3.0666e-31 Ns.

Wait, but none of the options are in that ballpark. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let me recalculate B.

I think I might have messed up the exponents somewhere. Let's go through it again.

Given:

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2) /22 =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ =1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute 1.81818 *1.6605:

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ let's compute:

1.81818 *1.6 = 2.909088.

1.81818 *0.0605 = approx 0.11007.

Total ≈ 2.909088 + 0.11007 = 3.019158e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I =μ r² =3.019158e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019158e-27 *4e-20 =1.207663e-46 kg m².

Now, B = (ħ^2)/(2 I), but ħ is h/(2π), so ħ^2 = h²/(4π²).

So,

B = [ (h²)/(4 π²) ] / (2 I ) = h²/(8 π² I )

h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, since it's defined as such).

h squared: (6.62607015e-34)^2 = 4.39047e-67 J² s².

Compute denominator: 8 π² I.

π² ≈9.8696.

So 8 *9.8696 =78.9568.

Multiply by I:78.9568 *1.207663e-46 = ?

78.9568 *1.207663e-46 = let me compute 78.9568 *1.207663 ≈ 78.9568 *1.2 =94.74816, but let me compute it more accurately.

1.207663 *78.9568:

Calculate 78 *1.207663 = approx 94.149.

0.9568 *1.207663 ≈1.156.

So total approx 94.149 + 1.156 = 95.305.

So 95.305e-46 → 9.5305e-45.

So denominator is 9.5305e-45.

So B = h²/(8 π² I ) =4.39047e-67 / 9.5305e-45 = (4.39047 /9.5305 )e-22.

4.39047 /9.5305 ≈0.4605.

So B≈0.4605e-22 J →4.605e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = B*(2) =2 *4.605e-23 =9.21e-23 J.

Now, the photon energy E_photon = ΔE_rot =9.21e-23 J.

p = E_photon /c → 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s. So p =3.07e-31 N·s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → larger than my result.

B)2.3e-27 → even larger.

C)1.1e-27 → larger.

D)1.4e-28 → larger.

Hmm, none of the options are 3e-31. Wait, maybe I did a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should compute the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, no, I think I did everything correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest possible rotational state. So if it's in the fundamental state, the next state would be when it has J=1 and n=0. The energy required is B * 2.

Wait, another thought. Did I get the energy for the rotational transition correct? Because the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So, for J=0, E_rot =0; for J=1, E_rot=2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

Which is correct as I did earlier.

So if B is 4.6e-23 J, the energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, maybe the question is about the vibrational transition, because the problem statement says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Perhaps the next state is the first excited vibrational state, n=1, J=0. Because even though the energy jump is larger, perhaps in the context of the question, it's considering transitions that change the vibrational state.

Wait, but the rotational transition requires less energy. So why would the molecule switch to a higher vibrational state when a lower energy transition is available? Unless the problem is phrased differently.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So the rotational transition is lower in energy, so should be chosen.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is 3e-31 Ns, but none of the options are anywhere near this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating I, the moment of inertia.

Wait, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms. So r =2e-10 m.

Then I = μ r² = μ * (2e-10)^2 = μ *4e-20.

Earlier, I think I computed μ correctly. Let me check μ again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Converting to kg:

1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.81818 *1.6605e-27.

Compute 1.81818 *1.6605:

1.81818 *1.6 = 2.909088.

1.81818 *0.0605= approx 0.11007.

Total: 2.909088 +0.11007 =3.019158e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Wait, I think I miscalculated B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ²/(2I) = (h²/(4 π²)) / (2I) )= h²/(8 π² I).

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

I is 3.019158e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.019158e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.207663e-46 kg m².

So 8 π² I =8*(9.8696)*1.207663e-46 =78.9568 *1.207663e-46 ≈95.305e-46 =9.5305e-45 kg m².

So B=4.39e-67 /9.5305e-45 = (4.39 /9.5305 )e-22 =0.4605e-22 J →4.605e-23 J.

Wait, that's correct.

So ΔE_rot=2B=9.21e-23 J.

E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p=E_photon/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't include this. So what's wrong?

Ah! Wait a second, maybe I confused the rotational transition with the vibrational. Because the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, perhaps the transition is a combination of both. But the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be J=1, n=0. So the minimal energy change is 2B.

Unless the question is considering a transition that changes both n and J, but that would require more energy, so the minimal is 2B.

So why don't the options match?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a vibrational transition, which has a higher energy. Let's see: E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 →8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28, A is 1.9e-28, C is 1.1e-27.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is between options A and D.

Hmm, so if the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, but none of the options exactly match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, which involves changing rotational states without changing vibrational? Or perhaps the problem is about the vibrational energy transition, as the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy could be either J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0.

But which has lower energy? The rotational transition has a much lower ΔE, so the photon's energy would be 9.21e-23 J, leading to a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to J=1 in the same vibrational state (n=0). So the energy required is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: B is given by (h/(8 pi^2 mu c^2)) * (1/(r^2)), but no, I think it's better to stick with the standard formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational energy in terms of vibrational energy? Or perhaps the problem is considering the simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states, but that would require a higher energy, which is not the case for the 'lowest possible' energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Alternative approach: Compute the moment of inertia I.

I= μ r².

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

r=2e-10 m.

μ in kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.019e-27 kg.

I=3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 pi² I) → (6.626e-34)^2/(8 pi² *1.2076e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * pi² *1.2076e-46 =8*(9.8696) *1.2076e-46 =78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =95.305e-46 =9.5305e-45.

So B=4.39e-67 /9.5305e-45 =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39/9.53) *1e-22 → approx 0.46e-22 →4.6e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So the rotational transition requires 2B =9.2e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all much larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B.

Wait, another formula for B is B = ħ²/(2I). Oh wait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1) = B J (J+1), where B= ħ²/(2I).

Ah, yes! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I used B= h²/(8 pi² I), which is correct because ħ= h/(2 pi), so ħ²= h²/(4 pi²).

So, B= ħ²/(2I) = (h²/(4 pi²)) / (2I) )= h²/(8 pi² I), which is correct.

So earlier steps are correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational transition with the vibrational transition.

Wait, the problem states it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor model. Oh, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model considers bond length variations, which are part of vibrational motion. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational, but for the fundamental state, the main contribution is from the vibrational. So the transition to the next state would require a vibrational quantum jump.

Wait, but why? Because the rotational transitions are much lower in energy. Unless in this model, the rotational states are quantized but for a non-rigid rotor, perhaps the rotational energy is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition from the fundamental state (n=0, J=0) to the first excited state where both J and n increase, but that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon that causes a transition to the next vibrational state, which would be n=1, J=0.

In that case, the energy required is ΔE = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J. p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is smaller. Option A is 1.9e-28. Option D is about half of what I just calculated. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute E_photon again.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p= E_photon /c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.833e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.833e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of that. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a third.

Hmm. So why is my calculation not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the molecule goes from J=0 to J=1 in the same vibrational state, but I have to include both the rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, no, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is n=0 and J=0. So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be either J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0. The energy for J=1 is lower than n=1. So the minimal energy is the rotational transition.

But then the photon momentum comes out to be 3e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me check.

Wait, bond length is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m, correct.

Moment of inertia I is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recompute B with exact numbers.

B = h²/(8 pi² I )

h =6.62607015e-34 J s.

h² = (6.62607015e-34)^2 = approx 4.39047e-67 J² s².

pi^2=9.8696.

8 pi² =78.9568.

I=1.207663e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I =78.9568 *1.207663e-46=95.305e-46=9.5305e-45.

So B=4.39047e-67 /9.5305e-45 =4.39047/9.5305=0.4605 => 0.4605e-22 J → 4.605e-23 J.

So 2B=9.21e-23 J.

p= E_photon/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, and I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me compute E_photon for the vibrational transition again.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p= E_photon/c=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.835e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A)1.9e-28 → larger than 8.8e-28? No, 8.8e-28 is larger than 1.9e-28.

Wait, no, 8e-28 is larger than 1.9e-28. So 8.8e-28 is approximately 0.88e-27 Ns.

Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns =1.1e-27 =11e-28.

So 8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) or D (1.4e-28), but not exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but in the given options, the closest to my calculation is option D (1.4e-28). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Maybe the transition is not the first possible, but the next state after considering all possibilities. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the first excited vibrational state, but with a change in rotational state as well. But that would require more energy, which is not the 'lowest possible'.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the change in both rotational and vibrational states, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0, n=0 to J=0, n=1. Which is a vibrational transition. Because in that case, the energy required is h w=2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns, which is about 8.83e-28.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28), but none is exactly 8.8e-28. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of E_photon for the vibrational transition.

h=6.626e-34, w=4e14.

E_photon=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-20 =26.504e-20 →2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none match.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1.9e-28 Ns. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the rotational transition, and I made a mistake in assuming that the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns. But perhaps I should compute the rotational transition again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but the next allowed rotational state is J=1, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, but the given options are way off, so perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition.

But according to my calculation, the vibrational transition's momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, which is not among the options. The options' highest is option B: 2.3e-27 Ns, which is larger by a factor of ~26.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Maybe I should compute 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28.

Wait, but 8.83e-28 is 8.83e-28 Ns, which is 8.83e-28. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of my calculation. Did I perhaps miss a factor of 0.5 somewhere?

Wait, maybe the problem is considering a transition from J=0 to J=1, but including both the rotational and vibrational energy. But that would be a higher energy than the rotational transition alone.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy required for a transition from J=0 to J=1 and n=0 to n=1. But that would require even more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy for the Raman transition, which involves two photons, but the question is about a single photon.

Alternatively, perhaps the question involves the bond length in a different way. Wait, the bond length given is 2 angstroms. But in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length is variable, but for the purpose of calculating the moment of inertia, it's still taken as the average or equilibrium bond length. So I think my calculation of I is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is given in amu, but I should have converted it to kg correctly.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So 20 amu is 20 *1.6605e-27 =3.321e-26 kg.

Similarly, 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, 20 amu is 20 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.321e-26 kg.

My mistake earlier: when calculating μ, I used 20 amu and 2 amu. So μ= (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22 amu =1.818 amu.

Which is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg=3.019e-27 kg.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is about the transition to the next state after the fundamental state, which is the first excited state of vibration, but perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the energy level, which could be either rotational or vibrational, but the assumption is that the photon's energy has to match the vibrational energy, so the answer is option A or D.

Wait, if the transition is vibrational, then p=8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state of the vibration, but in terms of the quantum numbers. But I think I've tried that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require even more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires energy 2B, but perhaps I miscalculated B.

Wait, perhaps B is calculated in a different way. Let me think again.

Another formula for B is B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I). So I'll compute this once more.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

h^2=4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.2076e-46 kg m².

8 pi^2 I=9.5305e-45 kg m².

So B=4.39e-67 /9.5305e-45 =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = (4.39/9.53) *1e-22 =0.460e-22 →4.60e-23 J.

So, 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

But this is way off the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives the bond length in a different unit. Did the problem say bond length is 2 angstroms? I think it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used is different. Maybe it's the rigid rotor model, but even then, the result would be the same.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state of vibration (n=1) but with J=0, which requires E=h w=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none match, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 0.25 somewhere. Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20=26.504e-20=2.6504e-19 J.

Yep.

Wait, maybe the speed of light is taken as 3e8 m/s, which is correct.

So, I'm stuck. Either I'm making a mistake somewhere, or the intended answer is not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in terms of the energy levels, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational.

But according to the question, it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal ΔE is from the rotational transition.

But that leads to a p value not present in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the model. Wait, the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model).

In the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length is variable, which affects the moment of inertia. But I used the average bond length, so I think my calculation of I is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy in terms of the vibration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state where both n and J change, but that would require higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the next state is J=1 and n=1. But that would require even more energy than either transition alone.

Hmm. Another idea: perhaps the problem is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination of both vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure how that would be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would give a larger ΔE than J=0→1.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the first overtone (2B), but that would be even higher energy.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 3e-31 Ns for the rotational transition and 8.8e-28 Ns for the vibrational transition. But neither matches the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the first excited vibrational state, and the given options have a typo. For example, option D is 1.4e-28, which is half of 2.8e-28. But perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is n=1, J=0.

So E_photon = h*w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.833e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. But that's the same as the vibrational energy.

Wait, unless the problem is considering the energy as the difference between the ground state and the first rotational state, which is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are that small.

Given this, perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is option D, but I'm not seeing where I went wrong.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is using the reduced mass in a different way. For example, if the reduced mass was taken as (Mx + My) instead of the correct formula, but that would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the bond length in a different way, but I think I used it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers, but the given w is in radians per second, so I think I used it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the rotational energy using another formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J (J+1).

So, the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E= (ħ²/(2I)) * (1 * 2 )= (ħ²/(2I)) * 2 = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot = ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ = h/(2 pi) →6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈1.054e-34 J s.

ħ² = (1.054e-34)^2 ≈1.111e-68 J² s².

So E_rot=1.111e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx 9.2e-23 J.

So same result as before.

So, p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the momenta in a different unit, but the options are in Ns, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have E_rot=6B=6*4.6e-23=2.76e-22 J. p=2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 Ns.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Based on my calculations, the correct momentum is either 3e-31 Ns (rotational) or 8.8e-28 Ns (vibrational). Since the options don't include these, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

p=1.4e-28 Ns. E=pc=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Which is about 6.3 times larger. So perhaps the problem is considering a different frequency or a different model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational frequency in terms of wavenumbers or something else, but I think I used it correctly.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is the rotational transition with p=3e-31 Ns, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (n=0, J=0). The task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Energy Transitions**:  
   - The molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or a higher rotational state (n=0, J=1).  
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is calculated using the rotational constant \( B \), where:  
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad I = \mu r^2, \quad \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}.
     \]
     Here, \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \), \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), and \( \mu \) is the reduced mass. Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
     The moment of inertia is:  
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
     Using \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \), the rotational constant is:  
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} / 2\pi)^2}{2 \times 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.605 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
     The energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

2. **Photon Momentum**:  
   - For a photon, \( E = pc \), so the momentum is:  
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c}.
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]
   - For the rotational transition:  
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) is much smaller than any of the given options.  
   - The calculated momentum for the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) is also not an exact match, but it is closer to the options provided.  
   - Among the options, the closest value to the vibrational transition is **Option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \))**, though it is still significantly smaller than the calculated value.

Given the analysis, the most reasonable choice based on the options provided is **Option A**.

Answer: A
