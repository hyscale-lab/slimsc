Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or wait, β is 1/(kT), so Z = sum_{states} exp(-E/(kT)) = sum exp(-β E).

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. So maybe I should list all the possible states and their corresponding energies, then compute each term exp(-β E) and sum them all up.

But wait, perhaps there's a smarter way without listing all 8. Let me think about the possible values of the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, because S_i and S_j are each ±1. So each product S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are the same, -1 if different.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on how many pairs are aligned.

Wait, let's see. For three spins, the possible numbers of aligned pairs are 0,1,2,3. So the sum can be 3 (all aligned), or 1 (two aligned, one not), or -1 (one aligned, two not), or -3 (all not aligned). Hmm, but wait, let me check that.

Wait, each S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. So for three terms, how many possible sums are there?

Wait, let's think of the number of +1 terms in the sum. Each term is 1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (all three terms 1), 1 (two 1s and one -1), -1 (two -1s and one 1), or -3 (all three -1s). So four possible sums.

But wait, maybe not. Because the sum can also have other possibilities if the individual terms have different signs. Wait, but let me think about possible values.

Wait, another approach: for three spins, how many possible combinations of S1, S2, S3? 8. Let me list all possible states and compute the energy for each.

Wait, maybe that's manageable. Let's list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1,
