Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The question is asking about the angle between the two photons. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, they should annihilate into two photons probably because of conservation laws. Oh right, conservation of energy and momentum must apply here. So, the total momentum before collision should equal the total momentum after.

Wait, the setup: the electron is moving to the right (from the left) with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving to the left (from the right) with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, their directions are opposite. I think Lorentz factor (gamma) is the factor by which time, length, and mass dilate. But when calculating momentum, I need to consider their velocities and relativistic effects.

Each particle has a rest mass of, say, m (like the electron mass, since positron is just the antimatter version). The momentum of each would be gamma times m times their velocity. But wait, for electrons and positrons, their rest masses are the same. So, their relativistic momenta would depend on their velocities.

Wait, but Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, higher gamma means higher velocity. So, the electron has gamma 4, which is moving faster than the positron, gamma 2.

Wait, but the positron is moving from the right, so towards the left. So, their velocities are in opposite directions. That means their momenta are in opposite directions as well. So, their momenta will partially cancel each other, depending on their speeds.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify their directions. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its velocity is to the right (positive x-direction). The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left (negative x-direction). So their momenta are in opposite directions. So, their momenta might not sum up to zero unless they have the same magnitude.

But since their Lorentz factors are different, their momenta might not cancel out.

So, I need to calculate the total momentum before the collision. Because in the collision, the total momentum should be conserved.

So, the momentum of the electron: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.

Wait, but positron and electron have same mass, so m_e = m_p = m. But their velocities are in opposite directions. So, the positron's velocity is negative. Let me denote the electron's velocity as +v, so the positron's velocity is -u. So, their momenta would be p_e = gamma_e * m * v, p_p = gamma_p * m * (-u) = -gamma_p * m * u.

Wait, but wait. Are the velocities v and u related? Because for each particle, gamma is different, so v and u are different.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), I can express v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^
