Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. The options are A, B, C, D with various exponentials.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes an exponential term based on its energy.

First, I should figure out all possible states of the system. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. But maybe it's easier to group them by their energy rather than calculating each one individually.

Each state's energy E depends on the product terms S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3. Let's calculate each term for all possible combinations. But that might take a while, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, the energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each product term contributes to the energy. Let me denote each term as T1 = S1S2, T2 = S1S3, T3 = S2S3. Then E = -J (T1 + T2 + T3).

Each Ti can be either +1 or -1, because S is ±1, so product is ±1. So the sum (T1 + T2 + T3) can range. Let me compute the possible values.

The sum can be 3 (if all Ti are +1), 1 (if two +1 and one -1), -1 (if two -1 and one +1), or -3 (if all Ti are -1).

Wait, but wait, is that always the case? Let me think. For example, if S1, S2, S3 are all +1: T1=1, T2=1, T3=1. Sum is 3.

If two are +1 and one is -1, say S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. Then T1 = (-1)(+1) = -1? Wait no, T1 is S1S2. If S1=+1, S2=-1, then T1 is -1. T2 is S1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1. T3 is S2S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1. So sum is (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.

Wait, that's sum -1. Hmm, so maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, let me think
