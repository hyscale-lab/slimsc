Okay, so I've got this physics problem about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a big part of that. Let me try to think it through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. Oh right, because the Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light takes roughly that time to reach us. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we wouldn't know yet because the light hasn't reached us. But the neutrinos would have gotten here almost immediately because they have such tiny mass and can pass through stuff easily. So the neutrinos we detect now would already reflect the change.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (Band 1) and 800-900 keV (Band 2). So I need to figure out how stopping the pp-III branch affects the number of neutrinos in these two bands.

Wait, what is the pp-III branch? From what I remember, the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch leads to the production of deuterium, and then there's pp-II and pp-III. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces 7 Be neutrinos, which then decay into 7 Be and then into 8 B, which emits neutrinos as well. So the neutrinos from pp-III are higher in energy than the ones from the other branches, I think.

If pp-III stops, then the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would stop. But the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) would still continue, right? So what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

So, the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in higher energy ranges. If that's turned off, then the flux in the higher energy bands should decrease. But what about the lower ones?

Wait, I think the pp-III neutrinos are in the higher-energy range, like above 500 keV or so. So if they stop, the flux in the higher bands (like 800-900 keV) would drop a lot because those are mostly from pp-III. Whereas the lower bands (like 700-800) might have a mix of pp-III and other sources.

Wait no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The pp-III branch is one part of the proton-proton chain. The main products are helium-4 and positrons, and they also produce neutrinos. Specifically, the pp-III branch produces 7Be, which decays into 8B, emitting a neutrino in the process. The 8B decay emits a neutrino of around 15-18 MeV, I think, but wait, that's higher than the bands we're looking at. Wait, our bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, 1 MeV is 1000 keV, so 18 MeV is 18,000 keV. Oh wait, that's way higher. So maybe I'm mixing up the neutrino types.

Hold on, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me clarify: there are different types of solar neutrinos. The main ones are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. The proton-proton chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. I think the pp-III branch actually produces higher-energy neutrinos than the other pp branches, but not as high as the CNO neutrinos. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the solar neutrino spectrum. The dominant neutrinos are from the pp reactions, with a peak around 200 keV or
