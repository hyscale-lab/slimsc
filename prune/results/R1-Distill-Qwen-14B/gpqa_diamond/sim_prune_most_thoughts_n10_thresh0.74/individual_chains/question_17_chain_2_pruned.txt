Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, usually in a 1:1 ratio. So the formula would be something like CaEDTA^2- or CaY^2- maybe. The given K for the complex, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. That's a pretty big K, which means the complex is very stable, right? So the reaction should go almost to completion.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh right, because EDTA binds to Ca²+ to form the complex, the free Ca²+ concentration should be really low. 

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think it's a formation constant problem. The formation constant, Kf, is usually given by the equation for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is 5x10^10. 

So the formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = Kf. Since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Because the initial concentration of Ca and EDTA are the same and in a 1:1 ratio, they all form the complex. Wait, but maybe that's assuming they're both 0.02 M initially. Hmm, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution, which I think means that the moles of Ca and EDTA are equal, so they form the complex without any excess of either.

But wait, in reality, EDTA isn't all in the Y^4- form because it's a polyprotic acid and its deprotonation depends on pH. The problem states that pH is ideal, so perhaps we can assume that EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y^4-. So the initial concentrations are Ca²+ 0.02 M and Y^4- 0.
