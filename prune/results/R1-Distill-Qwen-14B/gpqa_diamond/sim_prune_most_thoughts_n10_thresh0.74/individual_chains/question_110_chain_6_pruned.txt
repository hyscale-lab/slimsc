Okay, so I'm looking at this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question gives me some data about each star, and I need to figure out which ones are observable by both instruments.

Wait, the key point here is the brightness of the stars as seen from Earth, their apparent magnitude. Because both spectrographs have different magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. But wait, no, wait. Because the brightness is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, it's okay for ESPRESSO. For HIRES, it's better than 16, meaning apparent V mag <=16. So the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO (so mag <17) and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES (so mag <16). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", meaning the apparent V mag is less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag less than 16.
