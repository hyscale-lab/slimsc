Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives a Lagrangian with some fields: NR singlet fermions, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar phi. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of phi is given as sqrt(x² + v²), where x is ⟨φ⟩ and v is ⟨H⟩, I think. Wait, no, the problem says ⟨φ⟩ = x, and ⟨h⟩ = v. Oh, so H is another scalar, maybe the Higgs component? Or wait, phi is a singlet, so maybe H is part of another field, like the Higgs field H which is a doublet?

Wait, the problem statement says that phi is a singlet scalar, so ⟨phi⟩ squared is x² + v². So perhaps v is part of the Higgs expectation value. Oh, maybe in this model, the Higgs field is split into real and imaginary parts, with H being the CP-odd component or something. Hmm.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. So, I'm thinking about the Higgs sector here. In the Standard Model, the Higgs field gets a VEV, and the Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z bosons. But in some extensions, like with additional scalars, you can have other Goldstone bosons, maybe as pseudo-Goldstones if there's some symmetry breaking pattern.

In this model, the scalar fields are S (a doublet), phi (a singlet), and I guess H is another scalar, maybe part of a doublet. Wait, looking at the Lagrangian: the terms include D^mu S, so S is a gauge field, probably charged under SU(2). The term |D^mu S|^2 suggests it's an SU(2) multiplet, perhaps a doublet. Oh wait, the problem states that S is a scalar doublet, so that makes sense.

The Lagrangian has a term y_i phi N_iR^
