Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. So the lattice is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each a rhombus. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, which I think is the edge length of the unit cell. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Interplanar distance, right, that's the d-spacing between the planes in the crystal. Oh, right, the formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, I remember that for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor depending on the angles. But wait, that's when the crystal is cubic. Oh, wait, no, that's only for cubic systems. For non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, the formula is a bit different.

Hmm, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h + k + l) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ) / something. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, no. The formula I'm probably thinking of is for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ between them. The formula is given by:

d² = [ (a² (k² + l² - 2kl cos α)) + (b² (h² + l² - 2hl cos β)) + (c² (h² + k² - 2hk cos γ)) ) ] / ( (h² + k² + l²)² (1 + 2 (h k cos α cos β cos γ) ... )) 

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should recall the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system specifically.

Wait, since it's
