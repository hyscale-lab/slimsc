Okay, I need to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants concerning resistance to anthracnose. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. Knock-out mutants were created, and their resistance to anthracnose was tested. The data is given, and I need to figure out the gene interactions based on the results.

First, I remember that gene interactions can involve things like redundancy, pleiotropy, or epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. For example, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the presence or absence of A affects the expression of B.

The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes, so if G is a transcription factor, it probably activates other genes involved in the resistance pathway.

Looking at the data:

- g1 (knockout of G1): 75% resistance. So, they're less resistant than wild-type (which is 100%). So, G1's product contributes to resistance, but not entirely necessary because at 75%, they're still somewhat resistant.

- g2 (knockout of G2): 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the infection at all. This suggests G2 is critical. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. If G2 is knocked out, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

- g3 (knockout of G3): 50% resistance. So, G3 also plays a role but isn't as essential as G2. Without G3, resistance is halved.

Now, the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Wait, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. If the effects were additive, maybe the double mutant would be lower, but 10% is much lower. Hmm, maybe there's an interaction here.

- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So, knocking out both G2 and G3 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, and G3 is a downstream gene activated by G2, then without G2, G3's function doesn't matter. So, the resistance is as low as G2 knockout.

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So, when you knock out both G1 and G2, the resistance is as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm, what does that mean? Maybe G1's function is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then G1 might be a target gene. Without G2, even if you have G1, it doesn't matter because G2 is needed to activate it. Wait, but in the single mutant, g1 is 75% resistant, which is better than g2's 0%. So, maybe G1 is not directly downstream of G2, or perhaps there's another pathway.

Wait, another approach: in a double mutant, if the phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, it suggests that the second gene's function is in the same pathway and downstream. For example, if knocking out G2 and G3 leads to 0% resistance like g2, then perhaps G3 is downstream of G2. Similarly, for g1g2 also leading to 0% like g2, maybe G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, but how does that fit with the single mutant g1? If G1 is downstream of G2, then in g1, the gene is knocked out, but G2 is still active. So, G2's target would normally activate G1, but without G1, maybe there's another backup or a partial pathway. But why is g1's resistance 75% instead of 0%? Because without G1, perhaps
