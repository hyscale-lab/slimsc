Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question gives the interaction Lagrangian between the bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson usually involves it splitting into fermion-antifermion pairs. The Lagrangian given is L = -λf ψ_f̄ (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. It looks like the interaction term is proportional to X(y) ψ_f̄ ψ_f. So X is interacting with fermions, and the coupling is λ f.

Since the boson X is decaying into fermions, the possible decay products would be pairs of fermions. The key thing is whether the mass of X is sufficient for the fermion pair. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so the sum of the rest masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but particles like electrons and neutrinos are very light. But the problem is about fermions that have mass. So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV each, since each would contribute m_fermion * 2 (since X would decay into a pair, so 2* m_fermion <= 6 GeV).

So let's list the known fermion masses:

Electron (e): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV. So decay into e+ e- is allowed.

Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV. So 2*0.1 = 0.2 GeV <6 GeV. So allowed.

Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV, so allowed.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Wait, top is way too heavy. Top quark mass is about 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So any decay into top quarks is impossible.

Wait, but when considering quark masses, the current quark masses are what matter. But in hadron production, the constituent quark masses are higher, but for decay into quark pairs, the current masses are the relevant ones. So let me think about the current masses.

Up quark (u): around 2 MeV, so negligible. So 2m_u ~ 4 MeV, which is way under 6 GeV. So X can decay into u ū.

Similarly, down (d), strange (s), and charm (c) quarks.

Wait, the strange quark is heavier. I think the current mass for strange is around 100 MeV or so. So 2m_s is about 200 MeV, way below 6 GeV.

Charm quark (c): current mass is about 1.5 GeV. So 2m_c is about 3 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so decay into c c-bar is allowed.

What about bottom quark (b)? The current mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because that would require at least 9 GeV, but X only has 6 GeV. So b is out.

Same with top (t) which is 173 GeV, way too heavy.

So possible quarks are u, d, s, c. So the possible decay channels are into pairs of these.

What about leptons? Tau, mu, e.

So the possible decay products are:

- e+ e-

- μ+ μ-

- τ+ τ-

- u ū

- d d̄

- s s̄

- c c̄

Wait, but wait—what about the bottom quark? Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction is with all fermions except maybe some? Or perhaps the interaction is with all species? The problem statement says "fermions," so perhaps all except maybe some, but I don't think so. So the interaction is with all fermion types, so any that can satisfy the mass condition.

So X can decay into any fermion pair where 2m_f <= 6 GeV.

So for quarks:

u: yes.

d: yes.

s: yes.

c: yes.

b: no.

t: no.

For leptons:

e: yes.

μ: yes.

τ: 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV, so yes.

So the possible decay channels are those involving e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the options, let me look.

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but I thought b is excluded because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is above 6 GeV. So option A includes b, which would be impossible. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, that includes c, which is allowed, and mu and tau as well. So 2
