Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. There are four options provided, each a different organic compound. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, which I'll need to analyze.

First, I'll start by looking at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So there are three degrees of unsaturation. That could mean three rings, or a combination like a ring and double bonds, etc. Hmm, likely one ring (like benzene) and maybe a double bond or an amide group, which would contribute to the unsaturation.

Now, looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad stretches, probably due to N-H or O-H groups. But considering the molecular formula, O-H is less likely because the options don't have obvious acids or alcohols. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe an amide or ester.

Moving on to the NMR data. Let's parse each peak:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, probably a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a triplet. Perhaps an ethyl group, where the CH3 is adjacent to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two hydrogens. Could be next to an electronegative atom or in an amide. Maybe an N-CH2 group? Or perhaps an OCH2, but the shift is around 4, which is a bit lower for OCH2. Alternatively, maybe an N attached, like in an amide.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, which usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. The quartet suggests two neighboring groups. So if this is a CH2 connected to another CH2, maybe as part of an ethyl group. Like OCH2CH2O or something similar.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, likely aromatic protons. Two protons as doublets suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para-disubstituted benzene, each H is adjacent to two others, but in the NMR, for a para substituent, each H would couple with two others, but in the case of a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, the protons would be a pair of doublets.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, higher shift. Also aromatic, but possibly more deshielded. Maybe substituted in such a way that the H's are more downfield.

Putting the aromatic region together: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So probably a para-substituted benzene ring. The lower field (8.0 ppm) protons might be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl or nitro group, which would deshield them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But wait, the molecular formula for this would be C9H11NO2? Let me check: Benzamide is C7H7NO2. 3-ethoxy would add an O and CH2CH3. Wait, molecular formula would be C9H10NO3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me calculate each option's formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH-. So 4-ethoxyphenyl would be C6H4-O-CH2CH3. The formamide would add a CO-NR group. So, the formula would be C8H9NO3? Wait, maybe I'm not calculating correctly. Let's recount.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So 4-aminophenyl would be C6H5NH2. So the formula would be C6H5NH2-C2H5COO? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the full formula would be C6H5NH2-C3H5O2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure is O=C(O-)CH2CH2NH-C6H4. So the formula would be C9H13N O2. But the given compound is C9H11NO2. So the formula here would have two more H, which doesn't match. So maybe not option C.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate is COO-. So 4-aminobenzoate would be COO attached to benzene with NH2 in para. Then ethyl ester, so O-CO-OCH2CH3. So the structure is OCH2CH3-CO-NH2-C6H4. Let me calculate the molecular formula: Benzoate is C7H5NO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2; replacing H with NH2, it becomes C7H5NO2). Then the ethyl ester adds C2H5, so total would be C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, so that's one H off. Maybe because the amino group is NH2, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the formula, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2
