Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about substances 1 to 6 undergoing electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The goal is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. Hmm, wait, increasing order of the para-isomer's weight fraction. So, which substances will form more para isomer and which less?

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing groups on the benzene ring determine where the incoming electrophile (here, Br+) will attack. Groups can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct ortho, para or meta.

Let me list out the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a benzoyloxy group, I think. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a carbonyl group attached to an ethoxy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent is COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl). Wait, the substituent is a benzoyloxy? Or is it that the benzene is attached to a COOEt group. Oh right, the substituent is the COOEt group attached to the benzene. So that's a carbonyl ester group. The carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So such groups are deactivating and meta-directing. So substituent is deactivating and meta-directing.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine attached to benzene. Cl is an electrone-withdrawing group because of its higher electronegativity. But wait, Cl is ortho/para-directing despite being deactivating because it's a halogen. The inductive effect is electron-withdrawing, but the resonance effect (if any) might allow for some activation. So Cl is deactivating (so substitution reactions are slower) but ortho/para-directing.

4) C6H5
