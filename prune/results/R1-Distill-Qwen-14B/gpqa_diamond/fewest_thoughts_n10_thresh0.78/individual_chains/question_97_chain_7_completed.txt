Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and genetic disorders. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is about why Klinefelter's syndrome has less severe phenotypic consequences compared to Down's syndrome.

Alright, first, I remember that Klinefelter's is when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so his karyotype is XXY. Down's syndrome is when there's an extra chromosome 21, so trisomy 21. Both are due to errors in meiosis, probably.

The question is about the molecular mechanism causing the less severe consequences in Klinefelter. So, why is XXY not as severe as trisomy 21?

I think it has something to do with how the cells handle the extra chromosomes. Oh wait, in females, having an extra X (like in Turner's) is different because they're usually XX. But in males, having XXY might have some milder effects because of something called X-inactivation. Oh right! In females, one X chromosome is inactivated to balance gene expression between males (XY) and females (XX). So in XXY males, maybe the extra X gets inactivated, reducing the impact of having an extra chromosome.

Wait, but how does that link to meiosis and the options given? Let me look at the choices again.

Option A: Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases after the zygote. That sounds like an epigenetic change. Maybe this affects gene expression, like X inactivation. Could be.

Option B: Progression of polymerase alpha in morula/blastocyst. Polymerase alpha is involved in DNA replication. I'm not sure how that ties to the phenotype severity.

Option C: Spindle attachment to kinetochores in metaphase I. If the spindle doesn't attach properly, chromosomes might not segregate correctly. But how does this relate to the milder phenotype? Maybe not directly about the mechanism causing less severe effects.

Option D: Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis. Chiasmata are where crossing over happens. Separase helps in cutting the cohesion between sister chromatids. If this doesn't happen correctly, maybe chromosomes don't separate, leading to errors. But again, how does that link to the severity of the syndrome?

Wait, the question is about why Klinefelter's has less severe consequences. So perhaps the reason is that the extra X is inactivated, which would be an epigenetic process. That would be option A, which mentions chromatin methylation. Because X-inactivation involves adding methyl groups to inactivate one X, which reduces the gene dosage.

So in Down's syndrome, every cell has an extra chromosome 21, so all the genes are overexpressed. But in XXY, once the extra X is inactivated, it's like having one active X and one inactive. So the gene dosage is closer to normal, hence the milder symptoms.

So the molecular mechanism is the inactivation of the extra X, which is an epigenetic change, specifically methylation, leading to less severe consequences.


Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) results from an extra X chromosome, while Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) involves an extra chromosome 21. The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less severe compared to Down's syndrome due to the inactivation of the extra X chromosome in males. This inactivation is an epigenetic process involving chromatin methylation, where one of the X chromosomes is silenced to balance gene expression between males (XY) and females (XX). This reduction in gene dosage results in milder symptoms compared to the constant overexpression of all genes on chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome.

Among the options provided, chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases (Option A) directly relates to this epigenetic mechanism of X-inactivation, which explains the less severe phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome.

Answer: A
