Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the confocal microscope after the experiment. Let me break down what's happening here.

First, the setup: They created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, like maybe it's constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, so IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, which can drive the translation of the second gene without the need for a separate promoter. So the ligand's expression would be under CBA, and the receptor's under the IRES.

Then there are these stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between itself and eGFP. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination. Cre recombinase will excise the stop cassette if the correct lox sites are present. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would block expression of the fluorescent proteins. But when Cre is present, they should recombine and allow the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

The experiment uses SOX10-Cre mice crossed with the homozygous construct mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

Now, when they breed the mice, the offspring would have the Cre under SOX10 promoter. So in neural crest cells, the Cre would be active. That should cause the lox sites to recombine, removing the stop cassettes, thereby allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP.

But in the Western blot, after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, they tested the expression. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed, but perhaps not co-expressed or something? Or maybe the eGFP isn't showing up for some other reason.

Wait, but the question is about the mouse model. They made a mouse that's homozygous for the construct. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active in certain cells.

But when they look with the confocal, the green signal (from eGFP) isn't present. So why isn't eGFP being expressed or detected?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this setup, both are in the same construct, and Cre is supposed to activate both. Not sure how this affects the GFP expression.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the eGFP isn't getting to the surface, you wouldn't see the fluorescent signal. But why would it be stuck? Maybe if the expression is not correct or the construct is faulty.

Option C: Enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe not needing an enhancer. But if the IRES isn't working, that could be a problem. Wait, the ligand is under CBA, the receptor uses IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. So if the IRES is not working, then the receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But why would the Western blot show anything? Unless the plasmid's expression in culture relies on the promoter, but in the mouse, it's under the same setup. Hmm.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, then when Cre recombines, the eGFP should be in frame. Unless the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed or the recombination wasn't efficient. Wait, but if the lox2272 is used, and the Cre used is regular (loxP), then maybe the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites. Oh wait, because lox22
