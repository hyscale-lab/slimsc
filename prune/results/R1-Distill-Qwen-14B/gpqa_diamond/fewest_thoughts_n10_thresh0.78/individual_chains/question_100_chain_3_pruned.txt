Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is propene, right? Because propene has the formula C3H6, same as cyclopropane, but propene is more common in reactions. So I'll assume it's propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually refers to an addition reaction. Since propene is an alkene, the bromine (Br2) in CCl4 would add across the double bond. So Compound A (propene) reacts with Br2/CCl4 to form Compound B. The addition would be anti, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So yes, that's B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base used for elimination reactions. So in this case, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation, an E2 elimination. Since there are two adjacent bromine atoms, elimination can occur to form an alkene. The possible alkenes would depend on the structure. Let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane would lose two HBr molecules when treated with a base, probably forming propene again, but wait, in what configuration?

Wait, wait. Wait, if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, the structure is BrCH2CHBrCH3. When you deprotonate, the base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. The possible alkenes are 1-propene (propene) or 2-propene (which is the same as propene because it's CH2=CHCH3). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=
