Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum. Hmm, so each electron has a p orbital, which means each has l=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, I think. But wait, wait—wait, wait. Because when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible total l is l1 + l2. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so max l would be 2. But wait, the state here is l=2, m=-1. So that makes sense.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each Li z is the z-component for each electron's orbital angular momentum. So the state is a coupled state, which is a combination of the individual states.

So the problem is, what's the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ each. So each electron's m is -1? Because Lz eigenvalues are mħ. Oh wait, no—wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum has m values from -l to +l, so for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So measuring L1z gives m1*ħ, and L2z gives m2*ħ. So in this problem, the measurement is for both being -ħ. So m1 = -1, m2 = -1.

But the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So this is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states of individual m's. Wait, but I remember that the coupled basis states are not the same as the product states. So the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m.

Wait, let me think. So in the coupled basis, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is expressed as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m. So in this case, our given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the m of the total angular momentum is -1. So in the product state, m1 + m2 = -1.

So what product states contribute to this coupled state? Since each electron has m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1). Because l=1 for each, so their m can be -1, 0, +1. So the sum is -1. So the coupled state is a linear combination of these two product states.

But wait, what's the exact expansion? I think when l = l1 + l2, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But wait, in this case, l1=1, l2=1, and l=2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the state where m = m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible m1 and m2 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Wait, but wait, when l=2, the maximum m is 2, and the minimum is -2. So when m=-1, the possible m1 and m2 pairs must add up to -1.

So let me recall. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states combining to l=2. The state |2, m> is a sum over m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = m. So for m = -1, the possible pairs are m1 = -1, m2 = 0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l=2, m=-1> is sqrt( (something) ), but I'm not exactly remembering the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of |m1, m2> states.

Wait, another approach: when you have two particles, each with angular momentum l=1. The coupled state with total l=2 and m=-1 is a combination of the individual m states. So, |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible |m1, m2> states are |−1, 0⟩ and |0, −1⟩. So the coupled state is a combination of these two. The coefficients for each term would be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but what's the expansion? I think the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, m=-1. The formula for CG coefficients is a bit tricky, but let me try to remember. For two spin-1 particles (like orbital angular momenta here), the state |2, -1⟩ is a combination of |m1, m2⟩ where m1 + m2 = -1. The specific combination is:

|2, -1⟩ = sqrt( (something) ) * |−1, 0⟩ + sqrt( (something else) ) * |0, −1⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the expansion coefficients. The general formula for the CG coefficients when adding two angular momenta is a bit involved, but I can try to compute it.

The CG coefficient for |l1, l2, L, M⟩ is given by:

⟨ l1, l2, m1, m2 | L, M ⟩ 

In our case, l1 = l2 = 1, L = 2, M = -1.

The CG coefficient is:

⟨ m1, m2 | 2, -1 ⟩ = \sqrt{ \frac{(2 + 1)(2 - (m1 + m2 - M))!}{(2 - (m1 + m2 + M))! ( ... )} } }

Wait, perhaps I should look for a simpler approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the possible components.

Wait, another way: for two particles each with l=1, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. So the state |2, -1> is one of the states in the l=2 multiplet.

The states for l=2 are m=2,1,0,-1,-2.

For each m, the state is a linear combination of the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = m.

So, for m = -1, the possible pairs are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

So, the state |2, -1> is a combination of these two. Let me think about the coefficients.

I remember that for l=2, the coefficients can be determined using the formula involving factorials and square roots.

The CG coefficient for m = -1 is given by:

⟨ m1, m2 | 2, -1 ⟩ = sqrt( ( (2 - m1 - m2) (2 + m1 + m2) ) / ( (2 - m1 + m2)(2 + m1 - m2) ) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I might be getting this wrong, so perhaps I can look for an alternative way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expansion of |2, m⟩ in terms of the product states.

For |2, 2⟩: it's just |1,1⟩.

For |2,1⟩: it's (sqrt(3/2)) |1,0⟩ + (sqrt(1/2)) |0,1⟩.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For two spin-1 particles, the |2, m⟩ states are built from the product states.

Wait, I think for |2,2⟩, it's |1,1⟩.

For |2,1⟩, it's a combination of |1,0⟩ and |0,1⟩.

Wait, perhaps the exact coefficients are known. Let me think. For the state |2, 1⟩, the coefficient for |1, 0⟩ is sqrt(3/2), and for |0, 1⟩ is sqrt(1/2). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 particles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for two l=1 systems, the |2, m⟩ states are as follows:

For m=2: only |1,1⟩.

m=1: a combination of |1,0⟩ and |0,1⟩.

m=0: a combination of |1,-1⟩, |0,0⟩, and | -1,1⟩.

Wait no, that might not be accurate.

Wait, another approach. The state |2, -1⟩ would be a combination of |m1, m2⟩ where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible m1 and m2 pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0.

m1=0, m2=-1.

So the state is a superposition of these two product states. The question is, what's the coefficient for each?

I think the CG coefficient for |m1, m2⟩ = |−1, 0⟩ in |2,−1⟩ is 1/sqrt(2), and same for |0,−1⟩. So the state |2,−1⟩ is (|−1,0⟩ + |0,−1⟩) / sqrt(2). Is that correct? Or perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, let me think about the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients must be 1.

Suppose the state is (|−1,0⟩ + |0,−1⟩)/sqrt(2). Then the normalization is (1/2)(1^2 + 1^2) = 1, so that works.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Another way to think is that for the two l=1 particles, the state |2, -1⟩ would be symmetric in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are the same for both terms.

So, assuming that |2, -1⟩ is (|−1,0⟩ + |0,−1⟩)/sqrt(2), then the expansion is correct.

So, if the state is |2, -1⟩ = (|−1,0⟩ + |0,−1⟩)/sqrt(2), then the probability of each product state is 1/2 each.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. Which corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

But in the expansion above, the product states are |−1,0⟩ and |0,−1⟩. Neither of these has both m1 and m2 as -1. So the coefficient for |−1,−1⟩ is zero in this state.

So the probability of measuring m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because the state |−1,−1⟩ would have m1 + m2 = -2, which would be the m for the coupled state |2, -2⟩. So that's a different state.

Therefore, in the |2, -1⟩ state, the product states are only |−1,0⟩ and |0,−1⟩. So the state doesn't include |−1, −1⟩ at all. Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero.

So the correct answer would be D) 0.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have the state |1,1,2, -1>, which is |2, -1⟩. So when I expand this into the product states, I have only |−1, 0⟩ and |0, −1⟩. So when I measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are either (−1,0) and (0,−1). So the possibility of both being −1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero. So the answer is D.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state is given as \( |l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle \). Here, \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, \( l \) is the total angular momentum quantum number, and \( m \) is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

The coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a linear combination of the product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = m = -1 \). For \( l_1 = l_2 = 1 \), the possible \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) values are \( -1, 0, +1 \). The only pairs of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) that satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \) are \( (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \). Thus, the coupled state can be expressed as:

\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right).
\]

This expansion shows that the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \), as this would correspond to \( m_1 + m_2 = -2 \), which is associated with the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-2\rangle \), not \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \).

When measuring \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \), the possible outcomes are \( m_1 = -1, 0 \) and \( m_2 = -1, 0 \). However, the joint probability of obtaining \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is zero because the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \). Therefore, the probability of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) being \( -\hbar \) is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
