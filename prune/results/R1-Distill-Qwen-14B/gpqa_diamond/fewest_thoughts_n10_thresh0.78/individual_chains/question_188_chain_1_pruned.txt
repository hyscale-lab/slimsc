Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So, in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. 

Wait, interatomic distance... so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms. I think the formula for interplanar distance, d_hkl, is given by something involving the reciprocal of the Miller indices and the lattice angles. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hkl)( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) ) / a² ), but wait, no, I think I might be mixing that up. 

Wait, another thought. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something about the angles. Oh wait, I remember that for a cubic crystal (all angles 90), the formula simplifies to d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). But since this is rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal? Or is it part of the cubic system? No, wait, rhombohedral is a subclass of the hexagonal crystal system? Or is it a separate system? Hmm, not sure, but maybe that's not too important right now.

So, the general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. The formula I'm trying to recall is d = [ (a²)/(h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha)) ) ]^(1/2) / (1), but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I've heard of the use of the reciprocal lattice or the metric tensor. 

Wait, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice would involve the dot product of the lattice vectors. Oh right, the interplan
