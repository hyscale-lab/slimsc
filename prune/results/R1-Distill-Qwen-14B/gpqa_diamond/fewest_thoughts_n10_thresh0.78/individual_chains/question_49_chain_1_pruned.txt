Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves along a sigma bond. Examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products for A, B, and C. My task is to figure out which option is correct by working through each reaction step by step.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) → A**

Hmm, okay. So the starting materials are a diamine and an alcohol, with H+ and heat. Wait, wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Wait, that structure might be confusing. Let me draw it.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be a molecule where the central carbon (ethanamine) has two methoxy groups (OCH3) and an amino group (NH2). So structure-wise, it's NH2-C(OCH3)2. Wait, is that correct? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2, but with substituents on the first carbon. So it's more like (NH2)(OCH3)2CH2? Or perhaps it's (OCH3)2CH-NH2? Wait, I think the structure is:

The molecule is ethanamine where the amino group is on the first carbon, and that same carbon has two methoxy groups attached. So the structure is: OCH3-O-C-NH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the amino group is attached to a carbon that's also bonded to two methoxy groups and a hydrogen. So it's (HOCH2) something? Wait, wait, no, the structure is more likely (OCH3)₂CH-NH₂. Because ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH
