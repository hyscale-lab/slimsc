Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is. The options are all some kind of propenyl or butenyl acetates, and they're either cis or trans. I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but let's think this through step by step.

First, the 1H NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

I remember that in NMR, the singlet at around 2.1 ppm is likely the acetate group's methyl (OAc group). So that's probably the OAc part, which is a common substituent in these compounds.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. Hmm, 16 Hz is a large coupling, which usually indicates a trans coupling in a double bond. In alkenes, the coupling between vicinal (adjacent) protons is around 10-18 Hz, so 16 makes sense for trans. Wait, but in cis coupling, the coupling is lower, right? Or is that in geminal? No, wait, geminal is different. Vicinal coupling in cis would be lower, maybe around 12-14 Hz, and trans higher, like 16. So a doublet with J=16 suggests that this proton is coupled to another proton across a double bond, in a trans configuration.

Then the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. That's a bit tricky. Let me think. This peak is probably from the vinyl protons (on a double bond). A doublet of quadruplets suggests that this proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. Wait, or maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another group. Let me visualize the structures.

The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let's list them out.

Propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc or maybe CH2CH2=CH-OAc? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- group. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the ester is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

But wait, the options are cis and trans for propenyl and butenyl. For propenyl, the substituents on the double bond would be the CH2 group and the CH2-OAc. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the ester group is attached to the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2-OAc, but wait, that doesn't
