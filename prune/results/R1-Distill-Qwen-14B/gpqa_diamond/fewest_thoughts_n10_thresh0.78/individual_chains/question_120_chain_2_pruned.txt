Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means as plx increases, the distance decreases. So closer stars have larger parallax values.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, probably in space, not just on the celestial sphere. So if you consider a uniform density of stars throughout space, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are and how their parallax relates to that distance.

Let's model this. Suppose the density of stars is uniform, meaning n stars per unit volume. We want to find how the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dN/dplx) depends on plx.

Since plx = 1/d, where d is distance, then d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by a small amount, d decreases by a corresponding amount. 

But how do we relate the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d to the parallax? Well, the volume of a thin spherical shell at radius d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be density (n) multiplied by 4πd² dr.

But wait, we need to express this in terms of
