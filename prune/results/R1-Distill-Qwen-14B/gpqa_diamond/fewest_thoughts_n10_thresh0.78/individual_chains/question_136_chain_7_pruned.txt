Okay, so I've got this vector field problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a given point. The divergence theorem might come into play here since we're dealing with a volume integral of the divergence.

Wait, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface.

But wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral. Maybe I can compute it directly by finding the divergence of f first.

So, let's think about the vector field. It's only along the radial direction and varies as 1/r². In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that depends only on r and has components (F_r, F_θ, F_φ) is given by (1/(r² sinθ)) ∂(F_r r² sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r² sinθ r)) ∂(F_φ r² sinθ)/∂φ + (1/r²) ∂(F_r)/∂r. But since all the other components are zero (only radial component), the divergence simplifies.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Let me recall. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only radial component F_r is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r). Because the other terms involve derivatives with respect to θ and φ, which are zero here.

Yes, so ∇·f = (
