Okay, so I have this physics problem about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a particle decay. Hmm, I need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me try to break this down.

The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But particles are moving, so we have to consider time dilation. The observed lifetime would be longer, right? Because from our lab frame, the particle is moving, so its lifetime appears longer. The formula is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So γ is calculated using the particle's velocity. But wait, how do I find γ? Oh, because the particle is moving with some energy, maybe I can relate that to its velocity or gamma factor. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity from the energy.

Wait, another approach. The energy of the particle is given, so maybe I can find its velocity. The energy E is related to the rest mass and gamma. E = γ mc². So γ = E/(mc²). Let me plug in the numbers.

Given E = 27 GeV, and mass m = 3.41 GeV. So E/(m) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918. So γ is approximately 7.918. Oh, wait, because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²) but since m is in GeV/c², E is GeV, so units would cancel, so yeah, γ is 27/3.41 ≈ 7.918.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s, so τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.334e-15 seconds. 

Wait, but why does the lifetime matter? Because the particles can only travel a certain distance before decaying.
