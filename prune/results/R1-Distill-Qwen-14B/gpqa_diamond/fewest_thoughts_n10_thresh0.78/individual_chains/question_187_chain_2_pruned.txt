Okay, so I've got this question here about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question says a star is detectable if it has a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet this criterion.

I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-precision spectroscopy, and its performance depends on factors like the brightness of the star and the exposure time. The S/N ratio depends on the flux received from the star, which in turn depends on the star's intrinsic brightness (luminosity) and its distance from us.

Wait, the formula for calculating S/N comes to mind. I think the S/N per pixel (assuming some binning) is proportional to the square root of the exposure time multiplied by the flux. The flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and the star's apparent magnitude will determine the flux we receive.

Oh right, the formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise. But I'm not exactly sure about the precise formula, maybe I should think in terms of how apparent magnitude affects S/N.

The apparent magnitude (m) of a star tells us how bright it appears from Earth. The lower the m, the brighter the star. The formula relating absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) is m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d). So for each star, I can compute its apparent magnitude to find out how bright it would appear to us.

The ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the star's brightness. I think ESPRESSO has a certain limit below which stars are too faint to reach an S/N of 10. So I need to find which stars are bright enough.

Wait, what's the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve? From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed for very high S/N, but maybe for each star, I have to compute if their apparent magnitude is bright enough to get S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

I also remember that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. So for a given star, if you double the exposure time, the S/N increases by a factor of sqrt(2). But in this case, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, so I just need the S/N at that time.

The key is to figure out which stars have an apparent magnitude that allows S/N >=10 in 1 hour.

Wait, but how does apparent magnitude translate into S/N? I think there's a formula involving the number of photons received. The S/N per pixel is proportional to the flux, which is 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude. But I need to find what m corresponds to an S/N of 10.

Alternatively, I can think about the relationship between the star's V magnitude and the S/N. I remember that
