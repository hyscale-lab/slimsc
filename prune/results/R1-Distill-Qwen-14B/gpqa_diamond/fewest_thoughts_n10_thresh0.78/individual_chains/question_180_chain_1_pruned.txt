Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, making it 3.2e-19 C. But maybe I'll keep it as 2e for now since it might simplify calculations.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Hmm.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. So I'm thinking this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. For a system of charges, the potential energy is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, the charges are fixed in place, so the potential energy is determined by their positions and charges.

But wait, do I need to consider all possible pairs here? Let me think. There are 13 charges, but the 13th is fixed at P. So the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. I wonder if the arrangement is such that each of those 12 is at the same distance from P, but maybe they are placed symmetrically around P. But for potential energy, maybe I can treat each of the 12 as being at a distance of 2 meters from P, but how about their distances from each other?

Hmm. Oh, wait, if all 12 are at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. Oh, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps they are all at the same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other (like forming a
