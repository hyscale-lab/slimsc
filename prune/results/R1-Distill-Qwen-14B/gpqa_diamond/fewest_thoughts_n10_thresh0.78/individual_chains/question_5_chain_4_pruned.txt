Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when a measurement is made.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction n could be any direction in the x-z plane, so it's not along the standard x, y, or z axes. Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component of n would be zero. So the direction vector n would be (nx, 0, nz), where nx² + nz² = 1.

Now, the operator P must be proportional to the Pauli matrices, I think. Because the problem gives the components Px, Py, and Pz as 2x2 matrices scaled by ħ/2. Oh wait, yes, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each is multiplied by ħ/2 to get the components of P. So P is a vector operator where each component is ħ/2 times the corresponding Pauli matrix.

So the operator P is given by P = P_x X_hat + P_y Y_hat + P_z Z_hat, where X_hat, Y_hat, Z_hat are unit vectors. But since the direction is arbitrary, let's say the direction is n = (n_x, 0, n_z), because it's in the x-z plane. So the operator P along direction n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, wait, no. Because in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in direction n is given by S·n, where S is the spin operator. Since the muon has spin-1/2, the spin operator components are (ħ/2) σ_x, (ħ/2) σ_y, and (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P along direction n would be (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But in this problem, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y = 0. So P = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

The question asks for the eigenvector of this operator
