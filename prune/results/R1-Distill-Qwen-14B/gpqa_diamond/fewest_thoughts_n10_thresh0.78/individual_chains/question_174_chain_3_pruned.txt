Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other. Additionally, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. 

We're asked about the kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment, specifically the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A) 2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the mass of the products is less than the initial mass due to the energy released. But wait, in this problem, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So that means 1% of the mass is converted into energy. But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the total energy available would include kinetic as well as binding energy, but I think in this case, the energy released is the mass difference times c squared.

Wait, the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M. So the mass lost is 0.01 M, which would be converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy or gamma rays. But probably, in this problem, the kinetic energy is what we're considering.

So the first step is to find the rest masses of the two fragments.

Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one and m2 is the less. According to the problem, m1 = 2 * m2. The sum m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 = 0.66 M.

So the rest masses are 0.66M and 0.33M.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. That means the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, if fragment 1 has momentum p, fragment 2 has momentum -p. But wait, no, because their masses are different. Oh, wait, in terms of vectors, p1 + p2 = 0. So p2 = -p1. But since p is a vector, their magnitudes are the same but directions opposite. So |p1| = |p2|.

But since momentum p is related to velocity v, and for non-relativistic cases, p = m v. But here, since the energies might be significant, we need to consider relativistic effects.
