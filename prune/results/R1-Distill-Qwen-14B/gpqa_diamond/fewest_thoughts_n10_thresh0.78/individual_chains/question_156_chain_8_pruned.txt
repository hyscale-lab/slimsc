Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving oct-4-ene, specifically the (E) and (Z) isomers. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard and chiral.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation occurs when an alkene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So for each reaction, oct-4-ene (E and Z) would form epoxides.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z), so their structures are different. The double bond is in the same position, but the substituents on either side are opposite or same. So when each reacts with mCPBA, what happens?

Epoxidation via mCPBA is an electrocyclic ring-opening. Wait, no, maybe it's a peracid adding across the double bond. Oh right, mCPBA is a peracid, and it adds to the alkene in a concerted manner to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

For (E)-oct-4-ene: the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA adds, each oxygen comes in a specific way. But since the alkene is trans (E), the epoxide would form with a particular configuration. Wait, maybe it forms a cis epoxide? Or trans? Or does it form a specific diastereomer?

Wait, I think when a trans (E) alkene reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide formed will have the two new oxygen atoms on the same side. Because the peracid adds with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. No, wait, maybe it's more about the endo transition state. Let me think.

Actually, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a stereospecific manner. For a trans-alkene, the
