Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity and arranging them from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent, right? Since it's aqueous, which is a polar protic solvent, the basicity and solvation effects are important.

The nucleophiles given are four: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. Wait, I think I miscounted, there are five options here.

Wait, the question is arranging them from more reactive to poorest. So I need to figure out their nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

I remember that in polar protic solvents, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the stability of the nucleophile. So more stable nucleophiles are less nucleophilic because they're more solvated.

Let me list the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is an alkoxide ion, right? So it's a strong base. The substituent is a methyl group, which is bulky. But in aqueous solution, the solvation is strong because it's an ion. Wait, but steric factors might affect how well it can attack. The 4-methyl makes the cyclohexyl group bulkier, so maybe it's less reactive because of that.

2. Hydroxide (OH⁻): Another strong base. It's a common nucleophile. In aqueous solution, it's well-solvated but still quite reactive.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. Since it's a carboxylate, it's a weaker base compared to hydroxide or alkoxides because the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygens. Wait, no, wait. Propionate is CH₂CH₂COO⁻, which is resonance stabilized. So it's a weaker base than OH⁻ or cyclohexanolate. So in a polar protic solvent, its nucleophilicity would be lower because it's less basic and more stabilized.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): This is a neutral molecule and a weaker nucleophile compared to the deprotonated species. Because in aqueous solution, if it's not deprotonated, it's just a regular alcohol. So it's a poor nucleophile because it's not a strong base.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): Wait, wait, Ethanethiolate would be CH3CH2S⁻. Thiols are generally weaker bases than alcohols, but their conjugate bases are stronger. Wait no, wait, actually, thiols are weaker acids than alcohols? No, wait, wait. Wait, in general, alcohols are weaker acids than thiols. So their conjugate bases are stronger. So the conjugate base of a thiol is a stronger base than that of an alcohol. So HS⁻ is a stronger base than OH⁻. Because H2S is a weaker acid than H2O? Wait, no, wait. H2O is weaker acid than H2S. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think. pKa of H2O is around 15.7, and H2S is around 7. So H2S is a stronger acid than H2O. So the conjugate base S⁻ is weaker than OH⁻. So OH⁻ is stronger base than HS⁻. Wait, no, wait, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. So if H2S is stronger acid (lower pKa) than H2O, that makes HS⁻ a weaker base than OH⁻. So hydroxide is a stronger base than ethanethiolate.

Wait, but wait, HS⁻ is more polarizable because of the larger size of sulfur, so in some cases, even if it's a weaker base, it can be a better nucleophile. But in polar protic solvents, the key is the stability and solvation. So in aqueous solution, the more stabilized the nucleophile, the less reactive.

So let's think about each:

- Ethanethiolate (HS⁻): It's a weaker base than OH⁻ but because of the larger size of S, it's a better nucleophile in some contexts. Wait, but in polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity is often more about how well the nucleophile is solvated. So if a nucleophile is more stabilized (i.e., more solvated), it's less reactive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to arrange them in order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution.

In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is usually: weaker bases are less nucleophilic, but also, the solvation plays a big role. So for example, in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity for common ions is typically something like: I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻, but that's for the same type of ions. But when comparing different types, like O⁻ and S⁻, it's a bit different.

Wait, but for the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: O⁻ in a cyclic structure. It's a strong base but bulky. Bulky groups can reduce its reactivity because of steric hindrance.

2. Hydroxide: O⁻, not as bulky as the cyclohexanolate. So in terms of basicity, it's similar but maybe the cyclohexanolate is more stabilized? Not sure about that. Wait, cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, which is a stronger base than OH⁻? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in aqueous solution, the conjugate acid of the cyclohexanolate is a weaker acid than water, so the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base. Wait, wait, the pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19-20, I think. Water has a pKa of about 15.7. So cyclohexanol is a weaker acid than water, meaning cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. Oh, so cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻. So in terms of basicity, 4-methylcyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide.

Wait, but wait, wait, hydroxide is a stronger base than most of the others. So the order of basicity is: cyclohexanolate (strongest), ethanethiolate (weaker than cyclohexanolate?), hydroxide, propionate, methanol.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The basicity order is typically: the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base. So the pKa of the compound is important.

- 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa around 19-20. So its conjugate base (the cyclohexanolate) has a high basicity.

- Water: pKa ~15.7.

- Ethanethiol: pKa around ~10. So its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) has a lower basicity than hydroxide.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, H2S has a pKa around 7, but ethanethiol is more acidic than H2O. Wait, no, ethanethiol is more acidic than water. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For thiols, the pKa of ethanethiol (HSCH2CH3) is around 10. The pKa of water is about 15.7. So ethanethiol is more acidic than water, meaning that its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is a weaker base than hydroxide.

So the order of conjugate base strength (from strongest to weakest) is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (pKa ~19-20) > hydroxide (pKa ~15.7) > ethanethiolate (pKa ~10) > propionate (pKa ~4.88) > methanol (pKa ~19.7? Wait, wait, methanol's pKa is around 19.7, but wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting that wrong. Wait, wait, the pKa of methanol is about 19.7. Wait, but that's higher than cyclohexanol? Hmm, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, actually, the pKa of methanol is around 19.7. The pKa of ethanol is around 19.1. The pKa of cyclohexanol is around 19.9? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Wait, cyclohexanol is less acidic than methanol? Wait, no, wait, the pKa of methanol is about 19.7, so it's a weaker acid than ethanol (19.1), which is weaker than cyclohexanol (around 19.9? Maybe). Wait, I'm getting confused here because I'm not exactly sure about the pKa values. But regardless, the point is that the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide, which is stronger than ethanethiolate, propionate, and methanol. Wait, no, wait, methanol is a weaker acid than cyclohexanol, so its conjugate base (methoxide) is stronger than cyclohexanolate. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the pKa of their conjugate acids.

The conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is 4-methylcyclohexanol. Let's say its pKa is around 19.5.

Hydroxide's conjugate acid is water, pKa 15.7.

Ethanethiolate's conjugate acid is ethanethiol, pKa ~10. So its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is weaker than hydroxide.

Propionate's conjugate acid is propionic acid, pKa ~4.88. So propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide.

Methanol's conjugate acid is CH3OH, pKa ~19.7. So, methoxide (CH3O⁻) is a stronger base than 4-methylcyclohexanolate (since its conjugate acid is weaker, higher pKa). Wait, wait, no, because the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base.

Wait, pKa of conjugate acid: if the conjugate acid (HA) has a high pKa, it's a weak acid, so its conjugate base (A⁻) is strong.

So:

4-methylcyclohexanolate (HA pKa ~19.5) → stronger base than hydroxide (HA pKa 15.7), but weaker than methoxide (if methanol's pKa is 19.7, then its conjugate base is stronger than cyclohexanolate).

Wait, no, wait. If HA has higher pKa, A⁻ is stronger base.

So methanol's pKa is ~19.7, so methoxide is a stronger base than cyclohexanolate (19.5), which is stronger than hydroxide (15.7), which is stronger than ethanethiolate (10), which is stronger than propionate (4.88).

Wait, but the given nucleophiles don't include methoxide. They have:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (A⁻, pKa HA ~19.5)
2. OH⁻ (pKa HA=15.7)
3. Propionate (pKa HA ~4.88)
4. Methanol (CH3OH, neutral)
5. Ethanethiolate (pKa HA ~10)

So the order of basic strength (from strongest to weakest) is: 1 > 2 > 5 > 3. Methanol is neutral, so it's the weakest.

But in terms of nucleophilicity in a polar protic solvent, it's usually the opposite of basicity because the more stabilized (solvated) the nucleophile, the less reactive. So the strongest bases are the best nucleophiles, but in polar protic solvents, more polarizable and less solvated nucleophiles are better.

Wait, but wait, in polar protic solvents, the more stable the base (i.e., more resonance or better solvation), the less nucleophilic. So for example, in aqueous solution, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide because it's less solvated.

But wait, no, that's in a different context. Wait, in a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity correlates with basicity. But in polar protic, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the better.

So, for the given nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: strong base, but bulky. So it's a strong nucleophile but steric hindrance can reduce reactivity.

2. OH⁻: strong base, but in aqueous solution, it's well-solvated, so less nucleophilic than, say, ethanethiolate.

Wait, ethanethiolate is a weaker base than hydroxide, but because it's less solvated, it might be a better nucleophile. Or wait, if it's a weaker base, it's less likely to be a good nucleophile. But in polar protic solvents, which favors more the less solvated species.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution for these types of ions.

I remember that in aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is usually: RS⁻ > I⁻ > RO⁻ > HO⁻. But wait, that's not exactly the case here. Wait, hydroxide is RO⁻ where R is H. And RS⁻ is ethanethiolate.

Wait, but in our case, the nucleophiles are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanolate (bulky RO⁻)
2. OH⁻ (RO⁻)
5. Ethanethiolate (RS⁻)
3. Propionate (R-COO⁻)
4. Methanol (neutral)

So considering that in polar protic solvents, the less solvated nucleophiles are better. RS⁻ is less solvated than RO⁻ because S is larger and less electronegative, making it more polarizable. So ethanethiolate is a better nucleophile than hydroxide in aqueous solution.

Wait, but does that mean that in aqueous solution, ethanethiolate is more nucleophilic than hydroxide?

Yes, I think so. Because in aqueous solution, the solvation of ethanethiolate is less compared to hydroxide, making it more reactive.

So, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be:

Ethanethiolate (5) > Hydroxide (2) > 4-methylcyclohexanolate (1) > propionate (3) > methanol (4).

Wait, why is propionate less nucleophilic than the others? Because propionate is a conjugate base of a strong acid (propionic acid, pKa ~4.88), so it's a weaker base. In aqueous solution, it's less reactive.

Wait, but what about the cyclohexanolate? Since it's a stronger base than hydroxide, why is it less nucleophilic than hydroxide? Because in aqueous solution, the more the base is stabilized, the less reactive. So the cyclohexanolate is stronger base than hydroxide, but is it more or less nucleophilic?

Wait, perhaps in a polar protic solvent, the order of nucleophilicity is: weaker bases are better because they're less solvated. So, the order would be: more polarizable and less solvated → more nucleophilic.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should compare each nucleophile based on their basicity and solvation.

Let me list them with their basicity and solvation:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: Strong base (pKa ~19.5), but bulky. In aqueous, highly solvated but steric hindrance reduces reactivity.

2. Hydroxide: Strong base (pKa 15.7). Highly solvated, but less bulky than cyclohexanolate.

5. Ethanethiolate: Weaker base than hydroxide (since ethanethiol pKa ~10), but more polarizable. Less solvated than hydroxide, so more nucleophilic?

3. Propionate: Very weak base (pKa ~4.88). Poor nucleophile.

4. Methanol: Neutral, so very poor nucleophile.

Wait, so the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution would be: Ethanethiolate (5) is more nucleophilic than hydroxide (2), which is more than cyclohexanolate (1), and then propionate (3), then methanol (4).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than hydroxide, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, which reduces its nucleophilicity. So maybe hydroxide is more nucleophilic than cyclohexanolate in aqueous solution.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the order in aqueous solution is: 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) > 3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Wait, but why? Because ethanethiolate is less solvated than hydroxide, so more reactive, even though it's a weaker base. Then hydroxide is next, but perhaps the cyclohexanolate is less reactive due to steric hindrance, making it less reactive than hydroxide. So the order would be 5 > 2 > 1 >3 >4.

But wait, I'm not sure about the position of cyclohexanolate. Because it's a stronger base than hydroxide, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, so maybe it's less reactive. Alternatively, the steric bulk can also reduce its reactivity.

So perhaps the correct order is:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (hydroxide) > 1 (cyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4

B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3

C) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3

D)5, 2, 1, 3 and 4

Wait, option D is 5, 2, 1, 3, 4. So according to that, the order is 5 > 2 >1>3>4.

But wait, is the cyclohexanolate more reactive than propionate? Yes, because it's a stronger base. But in aqueous solution, is it more reactive than propionate? Probably.

So in the order, 5 is first, then 2, then 1, then 3, then 4.

Looking at option D: D)5, 2,1,3,4.

Which would be the order 5 > 2 > 1 >3>4.

So that would be the correct order.

But wait, another point: the 4-methylcyclohexanolate is bulky. So in practice, it may be less reactive than hydroxide because of steric hindrance. But in aqueous solution, maybe the solvation effect is more dominant. So, the order would have hydroxide less nucleophilic than ethanethiolate, but more than cyclohexanolate?

No, wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think about the solvation and basicity.

In aqueous solution, the order of nucleophilicity is usually: RS⁻ > RO⁻ (like I⁻, Br⁻, etc.) > OH⁻ (if RO⁻ is a weaker base than OH⁻), but in this case, some of the RO⁻ are stronger bases than OH⁻.

Wait, but in this case, the cyclohexanolate is a stronger base than OH⁻, but in aqueous solution, it's more solvated, making it less nucleophilic. So would OH⁻ be a better nucleophile than cyclohexanolate in aqueous solution?

I think so. Because OH⁻ is less solvated than the cyclohexanolate? Wait, no, cyclohexanolate is a bigger ion, more solvated. So perhaps in aqueous solution, the cyclohexanolate is less reactive than hydroxide because it's more solvated, despite being a stronger base.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting information. I think I need to clarify this.

I've read that in polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is more about the ability to shed solvent molecules. So, the more the solvent stabilizes the nucleophile (i.e., the more solvated), the less nucleophilic it is.

So, comparing OH⁻ and RS⁻, RS⁻ is less solvated (because S is larger and less electronegative), so it's more nucleophilic.

Now, comparing OH⁻ with cyclohexanolate, which is a stronger base. But cyclohexanolate is more solvated because it's a larger anion, so in aqueous solution, it's less reactive as a nucleophile than OH⁻. So the order would be ethanethiolate > OH⁻ > cyclohexanolate.

Wait, but that can't be right because cyclohexanolate is a stronger base, but perhaps in a polar protic solvent, it's less reactive than OH⁻.

Alternatively, maybe the order is: 5 > 2 >1>3>4.

But let me think of the options.

Option D is 5,2,1,3,4.

So that would be ethanethiolate > hydroxide > cyclohexanolate > propionate > methanol.

But is that the correct order?

Wait, another thing to consider: the cyclohexanolate is bulky. So even though it's a strong base, the steric hindrance makes it a poor nucleophile. So maybe in practice, its reactivity is lower than that of hydroxide.

So in that case, the order would be 5 > 2 >1>3>4.

But wait, option D is 5,2,1,3,4. So that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexanolate is more reactive than propionate but less reactive than hydroxide.

So the order would be 5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH⁻) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol). Which is option D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about where the cyclohexanolate stands. Because the stronger base should be a better nucleophile, but in a polar protic solvent, maybe it's not.

Another approach: let's think about the basicity and solvation.

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than OH⁻ (2), but it's less solvated, so more nucleophilic.

Hydroxide (2) is a stronger base than cyclohexanolate (1)? Wait no, earlier I thought cyclohexanolate is a stronger base because its conjugate acid (cyclohexanol) has a higher pKa (weaker acid). So 1 is a stronger base than 2.

Wait, so in terms of basicity: 1 >2>5>3>4.

But in terms of nucleophilicity in aqueous solution: the order is less about basicity and more about how well they shed solvent.

So in aqueous solution, the order might be:

5 (ethanethiolate) > 2 (OH⁻) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

But why is cyclohexanolate more reactive than propionate? Because it's a stronger base, so more nucleophilic.

But wait, in aqueous solution, cyclohexanolate is more solvated, making it less reactive. So maybe hydroxide is more reactive than cyclohexanolate?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is based on the conjugate acid's pKa.

The lower the pKa of the conjugate acid, the weaker the base, the less nucleophilic in a polar protic solvent.

Wait, no, in polar protic, the less solvated (weaker base) is more nucleophilic.

Wait, let's think: the conjugate acid's pKa:

1. 4-methylcyclohexanol: pKa ~19.5 → A⁻ is a strong base.

2. Water: pKa 15.7 → OH⁻ is a strong base.

5. Ethanethiol: pKa ~10 → S⁻ is weaker base.

3. Propionic acid: pKa ~4.88 → COO⁻ is weak base.

4. Methanol: pKa ~19.7 → CH3O⁻ is a strong base.

Wait, but in the given options, 4 is methanol, which is neutral, not its conjugate base.

Wait, so among the nucleophiles, 4 is CH3OH, a neutral molecule.

So, the order of strength of the conjugate bases (from strongest to weakest) is:

4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1) > hydroxide (2) > methanol's conjugate base (but methanol is neutral, so not present here) > ethanethiolate (5) > propionate (3).

But since the conjugate base strength is 1 >2 >5 >3.

In aqueous solution, the better nucleophiles are those which are less solvated, i.e., weaker bases. So ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than 1 and 2, but more nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

So the order would be: 5 (ethanethiolate) >2 (OH⁻) >1 (cyclohexanolate) >3 (propionate) >4 (methanol).

Which is option D.


To determine the nucleophilicity of the given species in aqueous solution, we consider the effects of basicity, solvation, and steric hindrance. In polar protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the extent of solvation. Stronger bases are more solvated, reducing their nucleophilicity. Additionally, steric hindrance can further reduce the reactivity of bulky nucleophiles.

### Analysis of the Nucleophiles:
1. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a strong base due to the high pKa (~19.5) of its conjugate acid, 4-methylcyclohexanol. However, it is bulky, which introduces steric hindrance, reducing its nucleophilicity. In aqueous solution, it is also highly solvated, further limiting its reactivity.

2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: A strong base with a pKa (~15.7) of its conjugate acid, water. It is less solvated than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate due to its smaller size and is a good nucleophile in aqueous solution.

3. **Propionate (CH₃CH₂COO⁻)**: A weak base due to the low pKa (~4.88) of its conjugate acid, propionic acid. It is resonance-stabilized, making it less nucleophilic in aqueous solution.

4. **Methanol (CH₃OH)**: A neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile. Its lack of charge makes it ineffective in nucleophilic reactions.

5. **Ethanethiolate (CH₃CH₂S⁻)**: A weaker base than hydroxide due to the lower pKa (~10) of its conjugate acid, ethanethiol. However, sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, making ethanethiolate less solvated and more nucleophilic in aqueous solution compared to hydroxide.

### Order of Nucleophilicity:
- **Ethanethiolate (5)**: Most nucleophilic due to its polarizability and reduced solvation.
- **Hydroxide (2)**: Next, as it is a strong base but less solvated than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.
- **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: Less nucleophilic than hydroxide due to steric hindrance and high solvation.
- **Propionate (3)**: Much weaker due to resonance stabilization and low basicity.
- **Methanol (4)**: Least nucleophilic as it is neutral.

### Correct Option:
The correct order of nucleophilicity is **5 > 2 > 1 > 3 > 4**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
