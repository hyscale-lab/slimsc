Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically happens in 1,5-dienes, right? The molecule must have two conjugated double bonds, and under certain conditions, like heat or acid, it rearranges.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Wait, let me visualize this structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridge rings. So, the azabicyclo suggests that one of the bridge carbons is a nitrogen. The numbering is a bit tricky. The 2 position has a vinyl group, so that's a double bond attached.

So the structure must be: a bicyclo system with two bridges, one of two carbons, another of two, and one of one carbon. The nitrogen is at position 2. The 5-ene is the double bond in the bicyclo system. And the vinyl group is attached to the 2 position as well.

Wait, but for the Cope rearrangement, I think the molecule must have a conjugated diene. Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl is CH₂=CH– attached to the 2nd position. The bicyclo system has another double bond at position 5.

So the structure is something like this: the bicyclo has a bridge with a nitrogen. The 2nd position has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?), wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So perhaps the structure is:

N is at position 2. The bicyclo is [2.2.1], so the bridgeheads are 1, 4, and 5. Wait, the bridges are between 1-4, 4-5, and 5-1? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Bicyclo numbering can be a bit confusing. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Let me think of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane as having three bridges: two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. So the bridgeheads are at positions 1, 4, and 5.
