Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about quasars and the Lambda-CDM model. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. So, I remember that in quasars, sometimes there are emission lines, and the peak could be from something like the Lyman-alpha line, but wait, Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, the observed wavelength here is 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. Oh, right, that's longer than the rest wavelength. So this must be due to redshift.

Redshift! So the rest wavelength would be shorter. Let me think. If the observed wavelength is longer, that means the source is moving away, so the universe is expanding. So the redshift z is given by z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. But wait, what's the rest wavelength here?

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. Which emission line would that correspond to when unshifted? Let me think. Hydrogen emission lines: Lyman series is UV, Balmer is visible. Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, Balmer-alpha (H-alpha) is about 656 nm. Wait, but 790 is longer than that. So perhaps it's another line. Alternatively, I'm mixing up the
