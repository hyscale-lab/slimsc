Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation, I think. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves a spacecraft traveling at a very high speed, so I guess special relativity comes into play here.

The scenario is this: aliens from the Large Magellanic Cloud have a spacecraft that moves at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 Earth years, but the astronaut is 22 years old. We need to find out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, so the astronaut's own experienced time is what we're looking for, right? Because the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," so that's their proper time.

First, I need to figure out the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. I remember that the LMC is about 160,000 to 180,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me pick an approximate value. Maybe 170,000 light-years? So the distance d is approximately 170,000 ly.

The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987c. Let me calculate the time it would take from Earth's frame of reference. So time t = distance/speed. Distance is 170,000 ly, speed is almost c. So t ≈ 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 170,000 years, since 0.99999987 is almost 1. Wait, but wait, because 0.99999987 is very close to c, so the time from Earth's perspective would be about 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ about 170,000 * (1/(1 - 0.13e-6)) ≈ wait, maybe I can approximate this. Let me compute 170,000 divided by 0.99999987.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So, 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. So 1/(0.99999987) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7. So 170,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 170,000 + (170,000 * 1.3e-7). Let me calculate that: 1.3e-7 times 170,000 is 1.3e-7 * 1.7e5 = (1.3 * 1.7) * 1e-2 = 2.21e-2 = 0.0221. So the time is approximately 170,000.0221 years. So roughly 170,000 years from Earth's frame. But wait, that's a really long time,
