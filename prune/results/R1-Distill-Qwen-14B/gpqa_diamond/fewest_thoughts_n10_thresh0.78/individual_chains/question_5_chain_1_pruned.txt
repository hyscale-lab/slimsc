Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says: I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. They give me the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The X-component, P_x, is ħ/2 times a matrix with first row (0,1) and second row (1,0). So P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is ħ/2 times [[0, -i],[i,0]], and P_z is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

I think the first thing I need to do is find the operator P along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. Since it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented by spherical coordinates where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ would be the azimuthal angle—since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, no. Wait, if it's in the x-z plane, the direction lies in the plane, so φ is 0 or π. But for a general direction, the unit vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But since n is in x-z plane, cosφ is ±1 and sinφ is 0? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. x-z plane means that the angle in the x-y plane (azimuthal angle) would be either 0 or π. So φ is 0 or π. So I can parameterize n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ is 0, or (−sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ is π. Or maybe n is (x, y, z) where y=0, so n=(a, 0, b), with a² + b² = 1.

But for the operator P along n, the operator would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Wait, but
