Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the resulting product. We need to identify what compound X was from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's the other way around. Oh right, epoxidation. So, when a diene or a dienophile is treated with this reagent, it forms an epoxide. Or wait, maybe it's the other way. Wait, I think the reagent is actually used for epoxidizing alkenes. Oh right, the reaction is called epoxidation. So if compound X has a double bond, reacting it with this reagent would form an epoxide.

So the product would be an epoxide. So the product's structure relates to compound X's structure with an epoxide group added.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is also known as DABCO. DABCO is used in the presence of an acid catalyst for epoxidation of alkenes. Oh wait, or is that another reagent? Wait, I might be mixing things up. Oh, another common epoxidizing agent is mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid), which reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. DABCO is used more for other types of reactions, like in the formation of enamines or perhaps in other cycloadditions, but maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the reaction conditions imply. The solvent is nonpolar, temperature is 403 K, which is about 130Â°C, and the reaction time is
