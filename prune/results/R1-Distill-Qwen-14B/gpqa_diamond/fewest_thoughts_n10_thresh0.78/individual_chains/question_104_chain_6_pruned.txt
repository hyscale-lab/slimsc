Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The problem states that for Planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times the orbital period of Planet #2 is longer than Planet #1's. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I think I remember that the RV method relates the Doppler shift to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. But wait, I need to recall the exact formula or the relationship here.

I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and planet. Or maybe it's about the Doppler shift? Wait, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star towards and away from us. So the shift in the spectral line tells us about the star's velocity.

The formula I vaguely remember is K = (v) which is related to (G * (M_planet) * sin(i)) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) ) or something like that. Or perhaps it's more precise to think in terms of the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin(i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1 / ( (2π) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. And since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that
