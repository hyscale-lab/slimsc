Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are various substances A1 to A5, each with different properties. I need to figure out the molecular weight of A4 and choose the correct option from A to D.

Let me start by breaking down each part of the problem.

First, the first paragraph says that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, like 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions, which suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so maybe A1 is a fluoride where Y is in a high oxidation state.

Wait, no, because A1 is a binary compound with fluorine, so it's YF_x. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, perhaps it's a decomposition where one product is fluorine gas. So, maybe A1 is a compound that releases F2 when it breaks down.

The second part says A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so oxidizing it suggests that A1 could be a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps containing Y in a high oxidation state. Fluorine is a good oxidizing agent, but when combined with other elements, their compounds can also be oxidizing. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent because Cl is in a high oxidation state.

Next, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So, A3 is another binary compound of Y and F. Maybe A3 is YF, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, we get A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Hmm, I'm not immediately sure what that could be.

Let me think about possible elements Y that form multiple binary fluorides. Fluorine combines with many elements, but I'm trying to find an element Y that has five binary compounds. Let me think about possible candidates.

Common elements with multiple fluorides include elements in the third period, like Cl, Br, I, but wait
