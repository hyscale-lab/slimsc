Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's running at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons.

Despite the pumps, some gas particles are still in the sample compartment. Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is calculated based on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. 

But when he turns on the electron beam, something happens. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And this happens even though the temperature stays the same. So Mike notices that the mean free path isn't what he expected when the beam is on. The question is why λ2 is different from λ1.

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, as the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases because molecules are less likely to collide with each other. So in ultra-high vacuum, λ1 must be quite large because the pressure is super low.

Wait, but when the electron beam is turned on, what's happening? The electrons are moving at a high speed, right? But the gas molecules are just sitting there. Oh, wait, but the electrons can cause the gas molecules to move or maybe ionize them.

Wait, I also remember that when dealing with electron microscopes, there's something called electron scattering, which is what the question is pointing out. Gas molecules in the vacuum chamber can scatter the electrons, which reduces the resolution. So perhaps when the beam is on, the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules more, causing more collisions.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Or is it about the electrons' mean free path? Oh, wait, the question says that Mike is observing the mean free path of the gas molecules. Wait no, no, wait. Let me read it again.

He connected the pumps to create a vacuum, and some gas particles remained. He determined the mean free path λ1. Then when he initiates the electron beam, he observes that the mean free path is now λ2. Wait, so the MFP of the gas molecules is changing when the beam is on? That seems odd because the beam shouldn't directly affect the gas molecules' movement unless it's causing some heating or ionizing them.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. The mean free path of the gas molecules is determined by their own motion—like their thermal motion. So the presence of the electron beam might change the conditions in the chamber in some way. Or perhaps it's about the electrons' mean free path in the gas.

No, the question says that Mike is observing the mean free path based on electron scattering. So maybe when the beam is on, the electrons are more likely to collide with the gas molecules, so the mean free path of the electrons is changing. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, no, the question states that Mike accurately determined the mean free path of the gas molecules to be λ1, but upon initiating the beam, it's now λ2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more excited or ionized, which could affect their movement. Oh, or perhaps the presence of the beam introduces additional pressure on the gas molecules, causing more collisions, thus reducing their mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons are causing the gas to heat up, which would affect the mean free path. But the problem states that the temperature remained the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another angle: in a vacuum, the mean free path is determined by the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula is λ = 1/(n * σ * v_avg), where n is the number density
