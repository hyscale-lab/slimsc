Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so the gamma-rays are really high energy.

Wait, I remember that photon-photon interactions are a way for high-energy photons to lose energy. The process here is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So, the gamma-ray is annihilating with a CMB photon to produce the pair. The cross-section for this reaction must be significant enough that the gamma-ray doesn't travel too far before annihilating.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited by the time it takes for this process to occur. So, the mean free time is the distance over the interaction rate. If the interaction rate is high, the mean free time is short, so the photon doesn't last long.

I think the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons (CMB in this case). The cross-section for pair production from two photons probably depends on the energies of the gamma and the CMB photon. Let me recall the formula for photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

The cross-section σ is proportional to (s)^(-1/2), or maybe another power? Wait, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by something like σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (4E_cm^2)) ), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I should think in terms of the threshold energy.

The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron and positron. So the sum of the energies should be at least 2m_e c². Wait, but since one photon is from the CMB, which is at about 1e-3 eV, and the other is the high-energy gamma, let's denote their energies as E_gamma and E_cmb.

Wait, but in the lab frame where the CMB is isotropic, the energy of the CMB photon is about 1e-3 eV. The gamma is much higher energy. So, the center-of-mass energy squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). But since the gamma photon is moving in some direction, and the CMB photon is in the opposite direction on average, or not? Wait, no, the CMB is isotropic, but for a given gamma, it's more likely to annihilate with a photon moving in the opposite direction, because that gives a higher energy in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the gamma is moving at some high energy, and the CMB photons are in all directions with a blackbody distribution. The most probable photon to interact would be the one with opposite direction, so their momenta are oppositely directed. So, for the threshold condition, the sum of their energies must be at least twice the electron mass.

So, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - ( (E_gamma/c) - (E_cmb/c) )^2 c^2. Let me compute that. Wait, let's see: photons' four-momenta. The first photon (gamma) has energy E_gamma and momentum E_gamma/c in the +x direction. The CMB photon has energy E_cmb and momentum E_cmb/c in the -x direction. So, the total energy is E_gamma + E_cmb, and the total momentum is (E_gamma - E_cmb)/c.

So, the invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total
