Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The question has two parts, A and B. I need to determine the correct options for each part and then choose the right answer from the given options.

First, let me break down the question. The first part (A) asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does NOT show tautomerism. The second part (B) asks, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which will show optical isomerism.

Alright, I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: Tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, usually O or N, leading to different structural isomers. This often happens in compounds with conjugated double bonds and adjacent hydrogens. For example, in aldehydes and ketones, keto-enol tautomerism occurs. But wait, wait, that's more about enol and keto forms. But for tautomerism to occur, the molecule should have a conjugated system allowing for such a shift.

Looking at the two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone, which I think is C6H4O2. It has two ketone groups (O) on the benzene ring. So, it's a di-ketone. Do quinones undergo tautomerism? I'm not entirely sure. Wait, benzoquinone is similar to benzene with two ketone groups. But for tautomerism, we need adjacent H's that can shift. Quinones have alternating double bonds. Hmm, maybe not? Or perhaps they can form some enol-like forms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism because the structure is already conjugated, making the tautomerization not favorable.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. Wait, so it's like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C, arranged in a ring? Hmm,
