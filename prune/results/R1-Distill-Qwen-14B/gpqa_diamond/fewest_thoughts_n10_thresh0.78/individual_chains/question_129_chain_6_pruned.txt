Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. I also have some hints and options to consider. Let me break it down.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints:

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b: The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1; E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, which are various cyclic ketones.

Let me think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN → B.

HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So A is likely a ketone because HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. The product B would be a cyanohydrin (which is an alcohol and a nitrile). So A is a ketone, B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, or wait. HCN can add to ketones via a nucleophilic addition. The carbonyl becomes an alcohol and a nitrile. So, for example, cyclohexanone + HCN → cyclohexanone cyanohydrin. So B would have an OH and a CN group attached to adjacent carbons.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and nitrile groups. Reduction of nitriles (CN) with H2 and Pd would give CH2NH2, but wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Wait, H2 and Pd typically hydrogenate triple bonds, like in alkynes to alkenes, and nitriles (CN) to amines (CH2NH2), but under certain conditions. Or wait, maybe in this case, the nitrile is reduced to an amine. Or perhaps the alcohol is oxidized or something else. Wait, no, the reaction is a reduction. So the nitrile (CN) group would be reduced. Let me think: Hydrogenation of a nitrile usually gives a primary amine. So R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2? Or wait, I think with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, the nitrile would be hydrogenated to an amine. So B is a cyanohydrin (R-OH and R-CN adjacent), so upon reduction, the CN becomes CH2NH2, and the OH would become an O- if it's deprotonated, but maybe it's part of an alcohol that gets reduced? Wait, no. Wait, the alcohol in B is from the original ketone. So when B is reduced, maybe the nitrile group is reduced to CH2NH2, but the alcohol is perhaps oxidized? No, because we're using H2 and Pd, which is a reducing agent. So the alcohol would remain as an alcohol? Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: Maybe the cyanohydrin has an -OH and -CN group on adjacent carbons. When you reduce the -CN group, it becomes -CH2NH2. So compound C would be a secondary amine adjacent to an alcohol. Or
