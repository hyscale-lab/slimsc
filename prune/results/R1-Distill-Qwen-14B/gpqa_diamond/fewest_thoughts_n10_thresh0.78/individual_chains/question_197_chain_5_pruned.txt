Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or to carboxylic acids, depending on the conditions. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think. Oh, right, when a nitrile reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it typically gets converted into an amine. Or wait, no—wait, maybe that's another reaction. Oh wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Oh! Wait, the hydrolysis of nitriles with HCl and PCl5 gives a chloro compound, and then with water it can form a carboxylic acid. But wait, red phosphorus and HI—oh right, I think that's the method used to convert a nitrile into an amine. Because when you have a nitrile (RCN) reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an amine (RCH2NH2). Oh wait, but in another scenario, maybe it's more about the hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look at the IR and NMR data provided to figure out what Compound X is, which will help me determine what the product is after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests either O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid) or N-H stretching (like in an amine or amide). But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak which usually corresponds to either a carbonyl group, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so that suggests an aromatic ring is present.

Now, the NMR data: The 1H NMR has several signals. Let's go through them. 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Aromatic protons are usually around 7-8 ppm, so maybe this is an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but they are usually deshielded and split into a doublet or something else, unless in a symmetric environment. But wait, another possibility is an exchange with water, which could cause it to be broad. Alternatively, could this be an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid? The -COOH group would have a proton around 10-12 ppm, and it's usually a broad singlet because of hydrogen bonding. So that could fit.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Those look like a pair of doublets typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic ring has two substituents opposite each other, each with two protons. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. That's usually a CH group adjacent to something else. Maybe a CH next to an oxygen or a nitrogen, but I'm not sure yet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen. Or perhaps part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, which suggests a CH3 group attached to something else. Maybe a CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a geminal di-substitution. Wait, a doublet for a CH3 group might indicate it's attached to a CH group, which is split by the neighboring protons. Like in an isopropyl group, where the CH3 is split by the adjacent CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, which is a common triplet for a terminal CH3 group attached to a CH2. So maybe a -CH2-CH2-CH3 structure. So that might be an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. So in the NMR, we have two doublets for the aromatic protons, which would suggest that the substituents are para to each other. Now, what are these substituents?

Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring: let's consider that each substituent has a certain number of protons. The 10.5 ppm singlet suggests maybe a COOH group (carboxylic acid), but wait—if the molecule has a COOH group, the IR would have a peak around 1720, which matches. But then, the NMR would have a COOH proton around 10-12 ppm, which is the 10.5 ppm peak. So that could fit.

But wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid
