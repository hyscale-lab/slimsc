Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and the chances of them transiting in front of their stars from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes directly in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the size of the orbit. 

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being considered. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits faster, closer in, I guess.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, perhaps a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit but not as much as a giant. So same size, but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability formula I think depends on the size of the planet, the size of the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (sqrt(a² - R_s²))) ), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the solid angle the planet covers as seen from Earth. Or maybe more accurately, the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s), but I might be mixing terms here.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (sqrt(a² - R_star²)) ), but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s + R_p ) / a )^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2))) ) but that seems complex
