Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides.

The question has two reactions. Both are with oct-4-ene, but one is E and the other is Z isomer. So, Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 is the same but with (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The process is stereospecific, right? Because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. Epoxidation would form an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. The epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on adjacent carbons. Wait, but I think the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, more accurately, the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene is a peracid adding across the double bond to form an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific, so the endo rule applies? Or perhaps it's more about the stereochemistry of the alkene. Oh wait, mCPBA adds to the double bond to form the epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening? No, wait, no, it's more like a concerted process where the peracid adds to the double bond, creating an epoxide with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene leads to the formation of an epoxide with trans stereochemistry in the epoxide ring. Because the peracid attacks the same face, leading to the oxygen atoms being on opposite sides. Or maybe it's the opposite. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, mCPBA is an electrophilic peracid. The alkene attacks the electrophilic oxygen, leading to the formation of a cyclic intermediate. The addition is a concerted process, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, for a trans (E) alkene, the substituents on either end are opposite. So, when mCPBA adds across, the oxygen atoms add in a way that the new substituents (the oxygen) are on the same side or opposite? Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it mentally.

Let me think about this. Suppose we have (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents on either side are opposite. When mCPBA adds, each oxygen joins to C4 and C5. Since the starting alkene is trans, the peracid would add such that the two new oxygen groups (from
