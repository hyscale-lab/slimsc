Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, the question is about relative motion and I think it involves special relativity because the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at that speed. I'm a bit confused about the directions here.

So, the problem is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, wait. The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, I need to find how far the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during that time, but time might be different in each frame.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The first part says, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards them at the same speed. So, the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. But wait, the speed is probably a significant fraction of the speed of light, so length contraction and time dilation effects might be significant.

Wait, but the question says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So, I don't have to worry about those factors. So, it's a straightforward special relativity problem involving time dilation and length contraction.

I think I need to calculate the proper time in the Galaxy's frame and then find the distance. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Let me recap. The ejecta's frame observes the Galaxy moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, no. Because in the problem, the ejecta is a part moving towards the center. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, both frames see each other moving towards each other at the same speed.

Wait, but in reality, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is more than each individual speed. Oh, wait no, their relative speed from either frame is as per their own frame. Hmm, let me not get stuck here.

The problem is that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, in that frame, the ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So, in those 50 seconds, the Galaxy would move a certain distance towards the ejecta. But the question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of time dilation. Because in the ejecta's frame, time is running slower or faster compared to the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. Let me think: in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it. So, from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slow. Conversely, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clock is running slow.

So, the time experienced in each frame is different. Let me denote the proper time as the time in the rest frame of the moving object. Wait, in this case, the question gives the time in the ejecta's frame (Δt' =50 s). I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, no. The ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The distance it travels would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt). But I need to find Δt.

Wait, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame, Δt' =50 s. So, how do I relate Δt and Δt'?

Using time dilation formula: Δt = γ * Δt' where γ is the Lorentz factor. But wait, no. Let me get the formula correctly. Time dilation says that the time between two events in the moving frame is longer than in the rest frame. So, if the events are the same (like the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame), then the time in the Galaxy's frame (which is moving relative to the ejecta) would be longer.

Wait, but wait. The events are: the start of the time measurement and the end. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the time between these events is longer. So, Δt = γ Δt'.

Yes, that's correct. So, the time in the Galaxy frame is longer than the ejecta's frame.

But wait, let me think about the formula. The Lorentz factor γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, v is 60,000 km/s. Wait, wait, what is the speed of light in km/s? Approximately 300,000 km/s. So, 60,000 is 0.2 times c (since 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4). So, v=0.2c.

So, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

Wait, 0.2 squared is 0.04, so 1-0.04=0.96, sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, so 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

So, approximately, γ is 1.0206.

So, Δt = γ Δt' = 1.0206 *50 s ≈51.03 s.

Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the 50 seconds of the ejecta's frame correspond to about 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta has traveled in the Galaxy's frame is v * Δt. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s for Δt seconds.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 *51.03 = let's calculate that.

60,000 *50=3,000,000. 60,000 *1.03=61,800. So, total is approx 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's very close. But wait, perhaps I approximated γ too roughly.

Let me compute γ more accurately. So, v=0.2c.

Calculate 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) = let's compute it more accurately.

We know that sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9797958971.

So, γ = 1 / 0.9797958971 ≈ 1.0206.

So, Δt = 1.0206 *50 = 51.03 s.

Then, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000 km.

60,000 *0.03=1,800 km. So, total is 3,060,000 + 1,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have that number. The closest option is D) 3,060,000. So, perhaps the approximation is to take γ as 1.0206 and multiply by 50, but maybe the calculation expects a more precise value?

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Let me compute 1.0206 as more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the ejecta is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy, and from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the proper time (the time in the ejecta frame) is 50 s. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

So, the time in Galaxy frame is Δt = γ (Δt' + (v x)/c² ), but in this case, x is the distance. Wait, no, perhaps that's for events not at the same place.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance using the length contraction formula. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. So, in 50 seconds, the Galaxy would have moved a distance of v * Δt' =60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km. But from the ejecta's perspective, the distance the Galaxy moves is shortened due to length contraction.

Wait, no. Wait, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, the distance would be length contracted. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the velocity addition formula. But I'm not sure it's necessary here.

Let me think again. The problem is: in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the distance the Galaxy moves is 60,000 km/s *50 s=3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards them. So, the time experienced is longer, so the distance is longer.

Wait, no. Because when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, the Galaxy's frame's time is longer. So, the ejecta has been moving for longer in the Galaxy's frame, so the distance is more.

Wait, perhaps I should think that in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time.

Yes, that's what I did earlier. So, with γ ≈1.0206, the time is about 51.03 s, so distance is 60,000 *51.03≈3,061,800 km. So, the closest option is D)3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives 3,060,000 km.

Wait, let me calculate γ more accurately. Let's compute 1/sqrt(0.96):

sqrt(0.96)= sqrt(96/100)= (sqrt(96))/10= 4*sqrt(6)/10 ≈4*2.4495/10≈9.798/10≈0.9798.

So, 1/0.9798≈1.0206.

So, 1.0206 *50=51.03 s.

So, 60,000 *51.03=60,000 *51 =3,060,000 plus 60,000 *0.03=1,800, so 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000, which is pretty close. So, maybe the problem expects the calculation without considering the gamma factor, but that would be non-relativistic, which isn't correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps I've confused the proper time. Because the proper time is the time in the rest frame. So, in this scenario, the proper time is the time in the ejecta's frame because the events (start and end of the time) happen at the same place in the ejecta's frame. So, Δt' is the proper time, and the other frame will see a longer time.

So, Δt = γ Δt' = [1/(sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))] * 50 s.

So, with v=60,000 km/s=0.2c, so v²/c²=0.04.

So, 1 - 0.04=0.96. sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9798.

So, gamma is 1/0.9798≈1.0206.

So, Δt=1.0206 *50=51.03 s.

Then, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 km/s *51.03 s= approx 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. Which is very close. So, perhaps the exact calculation with more precise gamma gives 3,060,000.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

sqrt(0.96)= let's compute it precisely.

We know that 0.98^2= 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.979795897.

So, 1/sqrt(0.96)=1/0.979795897≈1.020616.

So, 1.020616 *50 =51.0308 s.

So, distance=60,000 *51.0308=60,000 *51 =3,060,000 plus 60,000 *0.0308= 1,848 km.

So, 3,060,000 +1,848=3,061,848 km.

Hmm, but again, none of the options match exactly. The closest is D)3,060,000.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects? Because perhaps the question is a simple relative velocity problem, but that doesn't make sense because the speed is significant.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the ejecta is moving directly towards the center. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. And we are to find the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, wait. That's not correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time will be longer due to time dilation.

So, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * (Galaxy time) = v * γ Δt'.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is the same as observed in both frames, but that's not true because of length contraction.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy moves is shorter.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the dilated time.

Another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v, and in 50 seconds, the distance between them decreases by v * Δt' =60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer (γ *50). So, the distance the ejecta travels is v * γ *50.

Wait, but that approach would give the same result as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the proper distance is the rest distance, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps let's compute the exact gamma value.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.02062.

So, 1.02062 *50=51.031 s.

Distance is then 60,000 km/s *51.031 s= 60,000 *51.031 = 3,061,860 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, maybe using beta=0.2 and gamma=1/(sqrt(0.96))= approximately 1.0206, leading to 1.0206 *50 =51.03 s, and 60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km. Since option D is 3,060,000, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe the question is designed for non-relativistic calculation. Let me check if that's possible. So, if we ignore relativity, then the time in Galaxy's frame is same as ejecta's frame, which would be 50s. So, distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would ignore relativity, which is probably not the case.

The question mentions that both are inertial frames, which implies that we should use special relativity.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the time dilation applies in that way. Let me check the time dilation formula again.

In the frame S (Galaxy), the time between two events (e.g., when the ejecta starts moving and when 50 seconds pass in its frame) is given by:

Δt = γ (Δt' + (v x')/c² )

But in this case, both events occur at the same point in the ejecta's frame (x'=0), so the (v x')/c² term is zero. Therefore, Δt = γ Δt'.

So, that part is correct.

Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is γ *50 s ≈51.03 s.

So, the distance the ejecta travels is v *Δt=60,000 km/s *51.03 s≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is D)3,060,000 km.

Wait, but option D is 3,060,000, which is 60,000 *51 =3,060,000. So, maybe the question assumes that gamma is approximately 1.02, so 50.1 s. No, perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate without considering γ, but that doesn't make sense given the speed involved. So, the correct answer should be approximately 3,061,800 km, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the intended answer is D)3,060,000 km.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma exactly.

v=60,000 km/s=0.2c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)=1/sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(96/100)= (4 * sqrt(6))/10= (2 * sqrt(6))/5.

sqrt(6)= about 2.449489743.

So, 2 *2.449489743=4.898979486.

Divide by 5:4.898979486/5=0.979795897.

So, 1/0.979795897=1.020616.

So, 1.020616 *50=51.0308 s.

So, 60,000 km/s *51.0308 s= 60,000 *51.0308 = 3,061,848 km.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the intended approach is to not account for the relativistic effects, leading to 3,000,000 km, but that can't be right because it's a relativity problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually about the proper length. The distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is the proper length in the Galaxy's frame. So, from the ejecta's frame, the length is contracted.

Wait, no, the proper length is the length in the rest frame. So, if the distance is measured in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, the distance is length-contracted.

But wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Which would be v * γ * Δt'.

Which is 60,000 * 1.0206 *50 =60,000 *51.03=3,061,800 km.

But again, the options don't have this. So, perhaps the intended answer is D)3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the classical velocity addition formula, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta itself doesn't move (since it's its own frame). So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, and after 50 seconds, the distance the Galaxy has moved is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the distance the ejecta has traveled is more because of time dilation.

Wait, so the distance would be 3,000,000 km multiplied by gamma? No, that doesn't make sense. Because distance is not scaled by gamma in that way.

Wait, perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time.

Yes, which brings us back to the same calculation.

Given that, I think the correct answer is approximately 3,061,800 km, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended calculation is using a rounded gamma, leading to 3,060,000 km.

So, I'll go with option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The time given is \( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame, and we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, the time experienced in the moving frame (\( \Delta t' \)) is related to the time in the rest frame (\( \Delta t \)) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'
   \]  
   The Lorentz factor is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  
   Thus, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   \Delta t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance Calculation**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) for a time \( \Delta t \). The distance traveled is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D \) (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer, based on the relativistic calculations, is closest to option \( D \). 

ANSWER: D
