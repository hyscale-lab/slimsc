Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and think through it step by step. The question is about determining the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are often involved in diazotization reactions, but wait, when are those used? Oh right, typically for aromatic amines or maybe for certain ketones or aldehydes?

Wait, wait. Diazotization is usually for aromatic amines. They form a diazonium chloride, which can undergo various reactions. But the products here are diketones, which are more like two ketone groups in the same molecule. So how does that happen?

Oh, wait a second. I think I might be mixing things up. Another possibility is that the reagents are used in a different context, like the Stephen reduction or something else. But more likely, considering the products, maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement or some kind of ketone rearrangement. Or perhaps it's a di-ketone formation via some kind of oxidation?

Alternatively, I remember that when alcohols are treated with HNO2 (nitrous acid), they can form nitrous esters, but that's more for primary alcohols. Or wait, for secondary alcohols, maybe they form some kind of diazonium compounds? Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the formation of a gem-dinitro compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The products are diketones. So, each starting material (A and B) are treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water to give these diketones.

Hmm. What reaction conditions would convert a starting material into a diketone? Oh! I think this is a case of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but no, that involves ketones and introduces an oxygen to form a lactone or ketone. Or perhaps it's the Robinson annulation, but that's more about forming rings with conjugated dienes and ketones.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When epoxides are treated with HCl and then something else, they can form diols, but that's not leading to ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alcohols that, upon treatment, form ketones.

Oh!
