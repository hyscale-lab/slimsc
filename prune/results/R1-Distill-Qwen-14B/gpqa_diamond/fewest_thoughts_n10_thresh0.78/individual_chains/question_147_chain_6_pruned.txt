Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me read it again. The process is p + p_bar â†’ 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass? So perhaps we can approximate it as being at rest? Or is that not right? Because the problem says it's moving slowly, so maybe it's just moving with some low velocity, but perhaps we can treat it as non-relativistic? Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about the system. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So, the proton is perhaps at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. Or are they both moving? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving", so maybe it's moving at a low velocity, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial kinetic energy can be neglected, making the initial system's energy approximately the sum of their rest masses.

Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass, right? So the rest mass energy of each is about 938 MeV, I think
