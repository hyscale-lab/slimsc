Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says there's a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters because 1000 cm³ is a liter. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. But wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, isn't it? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. No, wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. The various deprotonated forms are H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, which is orthophosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So, the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So, the plan is: first, calculate the moles of each salt, then see how they dissociate in solution, and find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but let me think about the salts. KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, first, calculate the number of moles for each.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait, the problem states
