Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods, so they are probably exoplanets.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important. They’re in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So, what's equilibrium temperature? I remember it's calculated using the formula T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part goes away. So the formula simplifies to T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) / ... wait, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, I think the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. Because the planet reflects some light (albedo), and absorbs the rest. So the planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, its radius, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.

But wait, in this problem, the albedos are the same for both planets, so A cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures would be sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) multiplied by any other factors. Wait, no— because the formula for each planet is T_eq ~ T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - A)^1/4. Since A is same, (1-A) is same, so the ratio is just sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) ) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature equation is T_p = T_* * sqrt(R_*/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ). So the ratio of T_p1 to T_p2 is ( sqrt( R_*/(2a1) ) * (1 - A)^0.25 ) / ( sqrt( R_*/(2a2) ) * (1 - A)^0.25 ) )

Oh right, because everything else except a is the same for both. So the (1-A) part cancels, as does R_star and the 2. So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Because sqrt( (R/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( R/(2a2) ) ) = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ). So T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. The formula for each planet's T_eq is:

T_eq = T_* * sqrt( (R_*) / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So the ratio T1/T2 = [ sqrt(R/(2a1)) ] / [ sqrt(R/(2a2)) ] ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, wait, because it's sqrt(R/(2a1)) divided by sqrt(R/(2a2)).

So sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) * (2a2/R) ) ) ?

Wait, no— dividing two square roots is the square root of the ratio. So sqrt(R/(2a1)) / sqrt(R/(2a2)) ) =
