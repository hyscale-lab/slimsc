Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that should cancel out in the ratio. That's helpful.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ). But since the albedos are the same for both planets, the (1 - A) term is the same and will cancel when taking the ratio. So I can ignore albedo for now.

Wait, but the star's properties are given. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Oh, and the planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods. But for temperature, the key things are the star's luminosity and the planets' distances from it.

But wait, how do I find the planets' distances? The question mentions the RV method. Oh right, the radial velocity method gives us the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis (distance), while the transit method gives size (radius) and distance as well.

Wait, but the problem says both planets are detected using both methods, so maybe the distances are determined. But I don't see the distances given directly. Hmm.

Wait, the question does give the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass and the distance. The shift is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (a / (1 - e)) or something like that. But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just a.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is: K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) )^(1/3) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( sin i ) ), but since e=0 and assuming edge-on orbit (sin i =1, since transit occurs), this simplifies.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula K = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_planet/M_jup) ) * ( (M_star/M_sun + M_planet/M_jup )^(-2/3) ) * ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) / (P/(1 day)) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering the exact formula correctly. Alternatively, K is given by the mass function, but perhaps it's easier to think about the relation between K and the planet mass and distance.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of the RV semi-amplitude K. The formula is:

K = ( (2 π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since both planets are orbiting the same star, and the star's mass is much larger than the planet masses, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ ( (2 π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Assuming sin i is 1 (since we have a transit, i is 90 degrees), so that's okay.

But wait, P is the orbital period. How do I get P? Well, from the transit method, we can get the period, but the question doesn't provide it directly. Hmm, maybe using the Doppler shift and the mass to find the semi-major axis a.

Wait, another approach: The Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (a / (1 AU)) ) / (sqrt( (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) ), but perhaps that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (2π c) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is approximately:

K = [ (27.4 m/s) * (M_p / M_jup) * ( (M_star / M_sun) + (M_p / M_jup) )^(-2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) ] / ( (P / day) )^(1/3) )

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can relate the Doppler shifts of the two planets.

The question says that Planet1 induces a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Assuming that the RV method's shift is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the distance (or something similar), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternative approach: The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. K is given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04
