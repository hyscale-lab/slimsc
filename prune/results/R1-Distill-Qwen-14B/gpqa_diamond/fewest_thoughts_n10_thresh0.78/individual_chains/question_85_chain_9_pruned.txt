Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question gives me two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The problem mentions that both planets have been detected using transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star, but the radial velocity (RV) method looks at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. So the RV shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2 on the [OI] line at 6300 Å.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Or wait, the exact formula might be something like Te = T_star * ( L_star/(16πσ a^2) )^(1/4) ), but maybe I should think it through more carefully.

The equilibrium temperature formula is usually given by:

Te = T_eff * ( ( L ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4) )

But L is the star's luminosity, which depends on its radius and Teff. L = 4 π R_star² σ Teff^4. So substituting that in, the formula becomes:

Te = T_eff * ( (4 π R_star² σ Teff^4 ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4 )

Simplify that. Let's see: 4π R² σ T^4 divided by 16 π σ a². So the 4 and 16 gives 1/4. The π cancels, σ cancels. So:

( (R^2 T^4) / (4 a^2) )^(1/4 ) = ( R² T^4 / (4 a²) )^(1/4 )

Which simplifies to (R/(2a)) * T_eff. So:

Te = T_eff * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2 )

Wait, because (something squared) to the 1/4 is the square root. So yeah, sqrt(R/(2a)) times Teff.

So Te = Teff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) )

But wait, a is the planet's orbital radius. So the key here is to find the ratio of Te1 to Te2, which is (sqrt(R/(2a1)) ) / (sqrt(R/(2a2)) )) ) )
