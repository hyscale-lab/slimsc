Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, okay, let me try to think this through step by step. I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. 

The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would probably be the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I think the energy levels are given by some formula involving both the vibrational and rotational states. Oh right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be expressed as E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. 

The vibrational energy is quantized, with each level having energy E_v = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy, on the other hand, is E_r = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number.

The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. So that would be the first vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That probably means the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy. But wait, the next state with the lowest energy would be the one that's just the next in the sequence, so maybe the first excited state overall, regardless of being vibrational or rotational.

Wait, actually, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both, so the next state could be the next vibrational state (n=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (n=0, J=1). But which transition is lower in energy? Because the photon's energy must match one of these transitions.

So I need to calculate the energy differences for both possible transitions and see which one is lower. The photon with that energy will cause the transition.

Alternatively, another approach: the fundamental state is the
