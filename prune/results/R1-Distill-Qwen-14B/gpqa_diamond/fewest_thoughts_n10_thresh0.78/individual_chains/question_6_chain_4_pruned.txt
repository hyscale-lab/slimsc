Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials like this can sometimes be solved by transforming into a different coordinate system or by recognizing a known form.

Wait, the potential looks like a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos squared theta can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so it's (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ). Oh wait, so the total potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ.

Wait, let's add the terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², and the second term's first part is (3/4)k r². Adding them together: 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. Hmm, but wait a second. Or perhaps I should think of it differently. Maybe the potential can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates and then transformed into a different coordinate system.

Wait, I'm trying to remember... Oh, right! When you have a potential that depends on r and cos(nθ), sometimes you can separate the variables or transform into a different coordinate system. For instance, in polar coordinates, adding a term with cos(2θ) suggests that it's a perturbation or perhaps part of a different kind of oscillator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. But with cos(2θ), maybe that's equivalent to x² - y² over r²? Let me think. Because cos(2θ) is cos²θ - sin²θ, which is (x² - y²) / r². So perhaps the potential can be re-expressed in Cartesian terms.

Let me try that. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, no, the original is V= (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, but earlier I thought it's (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which is the same as (3
