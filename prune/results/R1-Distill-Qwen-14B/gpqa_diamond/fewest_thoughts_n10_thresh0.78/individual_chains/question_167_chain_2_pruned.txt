Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I've heard about non-Gaussian states in quantum optics before. Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states—basically, their Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. Non-Gaussian states are more complicated, like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). I remember that for such superpositions, the normalization depends on the phase phi and the amplitude alpha.

The question is to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy is usually a measure of how different two states are. So here, it looks like the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here. I think that Gaussian states have simpler entropy properties compared to non-Gaussian ones.

The problem gives specific values: phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. Hmm. Let's plug in phi first. So phi = -pi/4. Let me compute sin(2phi) first. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5: alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 1/sqrt(e) which is about 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) → 1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5). Wait, wait no: exp(-2 alpha^2), because alpha is 0.5, so alpha^2 is 0.25, 2*alpha^2 is 0.5. So exp(-
