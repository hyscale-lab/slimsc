Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products are formed. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. "1-bromobenzene-2-d" â€” wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo and should be 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Because if it's benzene with a bromine in position 1 and something else in position 2 and 4, that would make sense. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? No, wait, the "d" might stand for something else. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d as in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes the notation can be a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the "d" is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Hmm, that could be possible. Oh wait, another thought: perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, where the substituents are methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, the question specifies 1-bromobenzene-2-d, but perhaps that's a way of denoting a di-substituted benzene. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Alternatively
