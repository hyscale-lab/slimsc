Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in two dimensions, the potential can often be broken down into parts that are separable. Let me look at the potential here. It has two terms: one that's just (1/2)kr², which looks like a quadratic term, maybe a harmonic oscillator part. The other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. That seems like it's angular dependent, so maybe it's related to an anisotropic oscillator or something with a perturbation.

Wait, when I see cos²θ, I think about using a trigonometric identity to simplify it. Oh right, cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So let me rewrite the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos(2θ) ) / 2 ]
Simplify that: (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ)
Adding the terms: ( (1/2) + (3/4) ) kr² = (5/4) kr². So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos(2θ).

Hmm, but wait, the original terms might have been arranged differently. Maybe I should think of the potential as a sum of two parts. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to separate the radial and angular parts in a different way.

Another approach: think in terms of effective potentials or perhaps a shift in coordinates. Wait, maybe this is an example of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a perturbation. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, in two dimensions, the potential can be expressed in polar coordinates. The kinetic energy is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²), where p_r and p_θ are the radial and angular momentum operators. The potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (
