Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let's start by understanding the problem. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. So, wait, a benzene ring has 6 carbons. If it's di-substituted, that adds two substituents. But wait, 6 (from the ring) plus substituents. The total is 8 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 carbons total. Hmm, because 6 + 2 =8. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group, or maybe one substituent has two carbons. Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, but wait. Di-substituted benzene has two substituents attached. Each substituent could be a group like -X, but in this case, the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents are probably a halogen and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The ring has 6 carbons. Two substituents attached. So, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde, and another substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br.

Wait, but wait. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl (so maybe a ketone or ester or something like that), and also an aromatic-halogen bond. So, one substituent is -X (like Cl) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, like a carbonyl attached to the ring. Wait, but a carbonyl would be part of a group like -CO-R.

Wait, but if the substituents are a Cl and a carbonyl group, then the ring would have two substituents. Let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with a Cl and a carbonyl group attached. But wait, the carbonyl could be as part of a ketone, like a -COCH3 group, but that would add more carbons. Let me count: benzene (6) + Cl (0, since it's just substituting) + COCH3 (so that's 2 carbons, the CO is part of the substituent).
