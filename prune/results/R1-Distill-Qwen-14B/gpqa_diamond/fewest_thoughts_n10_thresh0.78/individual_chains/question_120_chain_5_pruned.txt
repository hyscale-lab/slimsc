Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, I imagine that means the number of stars doesn't vary much in different directions. But wait, actually, uniform distribution in the sky might mean that their density is the same across all regions. So, the same number per some volume in any direction.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) and distance (in parsecs) are inversely related. So, parallax plx = 1/distance. So, if plx increases, the distance decreases, meaning the star is closer.

So, the number of stars per unit parallax range depends on how many stars are at a particular distance range. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. But volume depends on distance, right?

Volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be (4/3)π(r+dr)^3 - (4/3)πr^3. For small dr, this approximates to 4πr² dr. So, the volume element is proportional to r squared dr.

Wait, but since parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, r is 1/plx. Then, the volume element, which is 4πr² dr, can be rewritten in terms of plx.

Let me substitute r = 1/plx. So, r squared is (1/plx)^2. dr is the change in distance. But since d=1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because as plx increases, d decreases. So, dr is negative of that. Let me see: d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr = -dplx / (plx^2). So, dr = -dplx/(plx^2). Hmm, but when I take an infinitesimal change, maybe the sign won't matter here because we're dealing with absolute changes.

Wait, maybe I can express the volume element in terms of plx. Volume element is 4π r² dr. Since r is 1/plx, that's 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is in terms of distance, I need to express it in terms of plx.

So, dr = (change in distance) = (change in plx) multiplied by derivative. Let's do calculus here. Differentiate d = 1/plx with respect to plx. So, dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since plx is positive, when plx increases, d decreases. But when we're integrating, the negative sign just indicates the direction, but the magnitude is what matters. So, take the absolute value: dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substituting back into the volume element:

Volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 dr = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, r is 1/plx, so r squared is 1/plx^2. dr is (1/plx^2) dplx. So, dV = 4 π r² dr = 4 π (1/plx^2 ) * ( dplx / plx^2 ). That gives 4 π (dplx) / plx^4. So, yes, dV = (4 π / plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is n, which is a
