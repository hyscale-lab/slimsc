Okay, so I've got this question about how the number of stars changes with distance, based on their parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, but parallax and distance are related, right? Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax plx equals 1 over distance d, so plx = 1/d. Or wait, no, wait—parallax is measured in parsecs, and the formula is that distance in parsecs is equal to 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

So, if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let's see: 1/( (1/d) )^5. That's 1/(1/d^5) ) which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So when you move a little farther, how does the number change? Hmm, but wait, I think I need to consider the differential, like how N changes as you go from r to r+dr.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it as a function of distance. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh wait, the question says 'distance r'. So it's using r as the distance variable. So substituting, N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then for each unit increase in r, the number increases by r^5. But the options are about how it changes with distance—so perhaps the question is about the number per unit volume? No, wait the problem says "the number of stars in that region of
