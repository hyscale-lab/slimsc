Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found a white solid, and they need to figure out what it is using some spectral data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, looking at the mass spec data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, what's that about? I remember that sometimes in mass spec, you can get peaks that are due to isotopes or maybe adducts. Since the molecular weight is 156, the 158 peak is two units higher. Two units might indicate something like a chlorine atom, because chlorine has an atomic weight around 35.5, so its isotopes can cause peaks. Wait, but waitâ€”158 is 156 plus 2. Chlorine has a common isotopic composition of about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So if there's Cl in the molecule, the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The 158 peak being 32% suggests that two Cl atoms are present? Wait, no, because each Cl in the molecule contributes to the mass. Wait, if there's one Cl in the molecule, then the molecular ion would have a peak at m/z 156 (35Cl) and another at 158 (37Cl). The ratio would depend on the natural abundance. For one Cl, the 37Cl peak would be about 25% of the molecular ion. But here, the 158 is 32% of the molecular ion, which is a bit higher than 25%. Hmm, maybe there's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula has a double bond or some other factor, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Wait, 156 is the molecular weight. Let me calculate the possible formula. Chlorine's atomic weight is about 35.5, so if the molecular weight is 156, and maybe it's C8H5ClO2? Let's see: C is 12, H is 1, Cl is ~35.5, O is 16. So 8*12=96, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. Adding up: 96+5=101, +35.5=136.5, +32= 168.5. Wait, that's way over 156. Hmm, maybe I should think again. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2? Let's see: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh, that's close enough. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. So that's one Cl. So the molecular ion at 156 (from 35Cl) and 158 (37Cl) would be present. The relative abundance is about 3:1 for 35Cl and 37Cl. Wait, because 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%. So the M+2 peak would be 25%, but here it's 32%, which is a bit higher. Maybe the molecular ion is a mix of something else, or perhaps the sample has more than one Cl. Alternatively, perhaps the 158 is not a Cl isotopic peak but something else. Maybe it's a fragment? Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, so the fragment at 15
