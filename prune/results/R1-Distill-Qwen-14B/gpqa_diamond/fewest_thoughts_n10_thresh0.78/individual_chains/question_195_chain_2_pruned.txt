Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The setup is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Now, the second planet is larger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have so that it both transits and occults the star.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit, it has to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. Similarly, for an occultation, which is when the planet passes behind the star, making it invisible (from our perspective, because the starlight drowns out the planet's light).

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect these events? I think the key here is the orbital period and the size of the orbits. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their orbits are in the same plane, but they could have different orbital speeds and distances from the star.

Transit and occultation events happen when the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. So, for both to happen, the second planet's orbital period must be such that the orbital timing allows for these events. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about when one planet overtakes the other in their orbits.

Wait, no, that's about conjunctions. Oh right, for transit and occultation to occur, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star as seen from Earth. So the planet's orbit must be aligned in a way that allows this.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet affect the occurrence of these events? Maybe I should think about their orbital periods and whether they can catch up to each other in a way that allows both events.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the orbital period in terms of the star's gravity and Kepler's laws.

Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star, the mass of the star is the same for both. So the ratio of their periods squared is the
