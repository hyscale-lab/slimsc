Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I remember RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something, but in this case, it's a different nucleus. Wait, the question says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think—Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X (which is Li-6) is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

Wait, relativistic speeds, so I should probably use the relativistic energy equations. Right, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First, I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy would be the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But since we're dealing in energy units like GeV, I'll probably need to use the rest mass in GeV/c².

Wait, the rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 0.938 GeV/c². But the nucleus has 6 nucleons, so the total rest mass would be approximately 6 * 0.938 GeV/c². Let me calculate that: 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV/c². But wait, nuclei are actually a bit more complicated because of binding energy. Oh, but for heavy ions, the binding energy is a significant fraction of the mass, but wait, in this case, Li-6 is a light nucleus. Hmm, maybe the rest mass is approximately the sum of the individual protons and neutrons.

But wait, maybe I should be precise. The exact mass of Li-6 is needed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass as 6 times the mass of a proton (since protons and neutrons have almost the same mass). So assuming each nucleon is about 0.938 GeV/c², so 6 * 0.938 is about 5.628 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, wait, but actually, a lithium-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass would be (3 * m_p) + (3 * m_n). The mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², and neutron is roughly the same, maybe a bit less. Let me check—I think the neutron mass is about 0.939565 GeV/c². So more accurate numbers might be better.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value can be found from the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of a deuteron or something else. Hmm. Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately, let me think, about 10.8112 u (atomic mass units). But wait, wait. No, wait, that's the molar mass. No, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.014 atomic mass units. Because each proton is about 1.007276 u and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So let me compute that.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So m = 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u. Wait, but that's about 6.0478 u. But the actual mass of Li-6 is slightly less because of the binding energy. Wait, but wait. Oh, no, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. For a nucleus, we're probably considering only the nucleons. So perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.014 u. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I should just use the proton mass as a proxy, or perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as 6 * m_p, but that might not be accurate. Wait, but perhaps the exact value isn't necessary, and the problem expects me to proceed with the given data.

Assuming that, let's proceed. So the rest mass energy is 6 * m_p * c². Since m_p is approximately 0.938 GeV/c², 6 * 0.938 = 5.628 GeV. So E_rest = 5.628 GeV.

Now, the velocity v is 0.96c. So I need to compute gamma. Let me compute the Lorentz factor gamma.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Calculating 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Yes, so 1/sqrt(0.0784) is 1/0.28=3.5714286.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Then, the total energy E is gamma * m c², which is 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857
3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284
3.5714 *0.028 = about 0.1000 (since 0.028 is 0.02 + 0.008, 3.5714*0.02=0.071428, 3.5714*0.008=0.0285712; sum is ~0.099999)

Adding them together: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0, plus about 0.1 gives 20.1. So E is approximately 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Option D is 21.419 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation for the mass is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, the rest mass of the nucleus isn't 6 * m_p. Because, when you combine nucleons into a nucleus, you have a mass deficit due to binding energy. So the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons. So my initial calculation of 5.628 GeV is an overestimation because it doesn't account for the binding energy.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the mass of the Li-6 nucleus accurately. Let me find the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141017 atomic mass units (u). Each u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², so converting that:

6.0141017 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

First, 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0141017 *931.5 ≈ 13.142 MeV.

So total is approximately 5602.142 MeV, which is about 5.602 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the atomic mass including electrons. Wait no, the atomic mass includes electrons. Wait, wait, the mass of the nucleus is the mass of the atom minus the electrons. So for Li, which has 3 electrons, each electron has a mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 electrons would be 1.534 MeV.

So the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0141017 u - 3*(electron mass). 

But the electron mass is about 0.00054858 u each. So 3 electrons are about 0.0016457 u.

So the nucleus mass is 6.0141017 u - 0.0016457 u = 6.012456 u.

So 6.012456 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/c²/u.

6.012456 * 931.5 = ?

Let me compute that. 6 *931.5=5589.

0.012456 *931.5 ≈ approximately 11.59 MeV.

So total is 5589 +11.59 = 5600.59 MeV, which is 5.60059 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5.6006 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714286, so E = gamma * m c².

E = 3.5714286 *5.6006 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.5714286 *5.6006.

Break it down:

3 *5.6006 =16.8018.

0.5714286 *5.6006 ≈

Wait, 5.6006 * 0.5 =2.8003.

5.6006 * 0.0714286 ≈ approx 0.4000 (since 5.6 * 1/14 is 0.4).

So 2.8003 +0.4=3.2003.

So 3.5714286 *5.6006 ≈16.8018 +3.2003=20.0021 GeV.

Wait, but that's approximately 20.002 GeV. But the options are more precise.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.6006.

3.5714286 *5 =17.857143.

3.5714286 *0.6006 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714286 *0.6 =2.142857.

3.5714286 *0.0006 =0.002142857.

So 2.142857 +0.002142857=2.145.

So total E=17.857143 +2.145=20.002143 GeV.

So approximately 20.002 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm, none of the options is exactly 20.002. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the mass I used is incorrect. Let me double-check the Li-6 mass.

The exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus (without electrons) is 6.012456 u, but wait, I think the actual rest mass of the Li-6 atom is about 6.0141017 u, but the nucleus would be that minus the mass of three electrons. Because the atomic mass includes electrons.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact mass of the nucleus is 6.0141017 u minus (3 * 0.00054858 u) =6.0141017 -0.00164574 =6.01245596 u.

So approximately 6.012456 u.

Then, converting to GeV/c²: 6.012456 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = ?

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.012456 *931.5= Let's compute 0.01*931.5=9.315, 0.002456 *931.5≈2.285. So total 9.315 +2.285=11.6 MeV.

Total is 5589 +11.6=5600.6 MeV=5.6006 GeV.

So that was correct.

Another possibility is that the problem uses the mass of a deuteron or another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula without the rest mass approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma and then multiply by the exact rest energy.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

Gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857...

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.6006 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6006.

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6006 = ?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.0006=0.002142857.

Adding these gives 2.14285714 +0.002142857=2.145.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.145=20.00214285 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.002 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's about 0.13 GeV higher. Hmm, that's a 0.6% difference. That seems a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the exact value for the mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus based on the number of nucleons, each being about 0.938 GeV, so 6 *0.938=5.628 GeV. Using that, gamma is 3.57142857, so E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628=?

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.028=0.1000000004.

So 2.14285714 +0.1000000004=2.24285714.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.1 GeV.

Ah, so with m=5.628 GeV, E=20.1 GeV.

Looking back, the options provided are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to 20.1 GeV. So perhaps the problem expects us to use m=6 * m_p, which gives around 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but earlier calculation with the exact nucleus mass gives about 20.002 GeV, but the option C is 20.132. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of about 0.13 GeV. Let me see if I miscalculated the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting u to GeV. Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV, so 1 u is 0.9315 GeV.

So 6.012456 u is 6.012456 * 0.9315 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

6 *0.9315=5.589 GeV.

0.012456 *0.9315= Let's compute:

0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.002456 *0.9315≈0.002282.

Adding them: 0.009315 +0.002282=0.011597.

Total mass is 5.589 + 0.011597=5.600597 GeV. So my previous calculation was correct.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.600597 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.600597.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600597.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.000597=approx 0.0021307.

So 2.14285714 +0.0021307=2.1449878.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.1449878=20.00213065 GeV.

So approximately 20.002 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.002 GeV. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rest mass as 6 times the mass of a proton. Let's try that.

Mass of a proton is about 0.938272 GeV/c². So 6 *0.938272=5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.629632= ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.029632= approx 0.105857.

Adding them: 2.14285714 +0.105857=2.248714.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.248714=20.105856 GeV.

So approximately 20.106 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher, but perhaps due to more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers for the proton mass.

Proton mass is approximately 0.938272 GeV/c².

So 6 *0.938272=5.629632 GeV.

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 -0.96^2))=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.571428571.

E=3.571428571 *5.629632.

Let me compute this accurately.

Breaking it down:

3.571428571 *5 =17.857142855.

3.571428571 *0.629632.

Compute 3.571428571 *0.6=2.1428571426.

3.571428571 *0.029632= let's calculate this.

0.029632 is approximately 0.03 -0.000368.

So 3.571428571 *0.03=0.107142857.

3.571428571 *0.000368=0.00131798.

So 0.107142857 -0.00131798=0.10582487.

So 3.571428571 *0.629632=2.1428571426 +0.10582487=2.24868201.

So total E=17.857142855 +2.24868201=20.10582486 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1058 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.026 GeV higher. Maybe because the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly higher than 6 * m_p?

Wait, in reality, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is a little less than 6 * m_p because of binding energy. So perhaps the problem expects me to use the 6 * m_p approach, which gives around 20.1058 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

But wait, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Let me think: perhaps the exact gamma is slightly more, or perhaps I made a calculation error.

Another approach: use more accurate calculation of gamma.

v=0.96c.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/(sqrt(1-0.9216))=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Wait, that's exact.

So, using m=6 * m_p =5.629632 GeV, E=3.5714285714 *5.629632.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.629632.

Using calculator-like approach:

3.5714285714 *5.629632.

Let me write it as:

= (3 + 0.5714285714) *5.629632

=3*5.629632 + 0.5714285714 *5.629632

3*5.629632=16.888896.

0.5714285714 *5.629632.

Compute 0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.0714285714 *5.629632 ≈0.403968.

So 2.814816 +0.403968=3.218784.

So total E=16.888896 +3.218784=20.10768 GeV.

So approximately 20.10768 GeV. Which rounds to 20.108 GeV.

The option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for m_p.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the lithium nucleus is not exactly 6 * m_p, but perhaps a little higher.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.012456 u.

As previously calculated, that's 5.6006 GeV.

So, 3.57142857 *5.6006 =20.002 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach should be to calculate the kinetic energy, but the question asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total energy, not just the kinetic. So the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy is the total energy. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't match exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me check.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total energy. No, the question says the energy of the collider, which is the total energy.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the ion, including electrons, but I don't think so because RHIC deals with bare nuclei.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is considered as 6 * (proton mass) =5.629632 GeV, leading to a total energy of 20.10768 GeV, which is approximately 20.108 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

But why the discrepancy? Let me recheck the exact calculation.

Wait, exact calculation:

gamma=3.571428571.

m=6 *0.938272 GeV=5.629632 GeV.

E=gamma * m=3.571428571 *5.629632.

Compute 3.571428571 *5.629632.

Let me do it step by step.

3.571428571 ×5.629632.

Break it into (3 + 0.571428571) ×5.629632.

3 ×5.629632 = 16.888896.

0.571428571 ×5.629632.

0.5 ×5.629632 =2.814816.

0.071428571 ×5.629632 ≈0.403968.

So 0.571428571 ×5.629632=2.814816 +0.403968=3.218784.

So total E=16.888896 +3.218784=20.10768 GeV.

So 20.10768 GeV is approximately 20.1077 GeV, which rounds to 20.108 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed, or I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute using the exact value of gamma.

Another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the relativistic energy formula without considering the exact mass of the nucleus, but rather using a simplified approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass as 6 times the mass of the alpha particle or something, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact gamma:

gamma= (1 - (0.96)^2 )^(-0.5) = (1 - 0.9216)^(-0.5)= (0.0784)^(-0.5) = 1/(sqrt(0.0784))=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the nucleus is a deuteron? No, the question says Li with 3 neutrons, which is ^6Li.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is taken as 6 * m_p, but using a more precise m_p value.

If m_p is 0.938272 GeV/c², then 6 *0.938272=5.629632 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.629632 =20.10768 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1077 GeV.

Looking at option C: 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.024 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption of m=6 * m_p is incorrect, and the actual mass is higher.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.0141017 u, which is 5.6006 GeV. Then, with gamma=3.57142857, E=3.57142857 *5.6006=20.002 GeV.

But none of the options match that. So the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Options:

C)20.132 GeV.

So 20.132 is about 0.025 GeV higher than 20.1077.

Hmm, perhaps this is due to using more precise values.

Wait, let me compute with more precise numbers.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

m=6 *0.938272 GeV=5.629632 GeV.

E=gamma * m =3.5714285714 *5.629632.

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

3.5714285714 ×5.629632.

Let me compute it as:

= (3.5714285714) * (5 +0.629632)

=3.5714285714 *5 +3.5714285714 *0.629632.

3.5714285714 *5=17.857142857.

3.5714285714 *0.629632.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 ×0.629632.

Multiply 3.5714285714 by 0.629632:

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.029632= ?

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.02 =0.0714285714.

3.5714285714 ×0.009632= approx 0.034378.

So 0.0714285714 +0.034378=0.1058065714.

Adding to 2.1428571428: 2.1428571428 +0.1058065714=2.2486637142.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.2486637142=20.105806571 GeV.

So approximately 20.1058 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.106 GeV. So the correct answer is approximately 20.106 GeV.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.026 GeV higher. Hmm, perhaps the actual rest mass is slightly higher than 6 * m_p, or perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.629632 exactly.

Let me set up the multiplication:

3.5714285714 ×5.629632.

Let me compute this step by step.

I'll write 3.5714285714 as approximately 3.5714285714 and 5.629632 as 5.629632.

So,

3.5714285714 × 5.629632.

We can write this as:

= (3 + 0.5714285714) × (5 + 0.629632)

= 3×5 +3×0.629632 +0.5714285714×5 +0.5714285714×0.629632

=15 +1.888896 +2.857142857 +0.361065.

Let me add them:

15 +1.888896 =16.888896.

16.888896 +2.857142857 =19.746038857.

19.746038857 +0.361065=20.107103857 GeV.

So approximately 20.1071 GeV.

Hmm, still close to 20.107 GeV, which is not exactly one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem didn't account for the exact speed and used a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the rest mass.

Let me reevaluate the rest mass calculation.

The exact atomic weight of Li-6 is 6.0141017 u. To get the nucleus mass, subtract the mass of 3 electrons. Each electron is 0.00054858 u. So 3 electrons is 0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.0141017 -0.00164574=6.01245596 u.

So converting to GeV: 6.01245596 u ×0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Wait, I think I used 931.5 MeV/u, which is 0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.01245596 u ×0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Compute:

6 ×0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

0.01245596 ×0.9315 = 0.011603 GeV.

So total is 5.589 +0.011603=5.600603 GeV.

So m=5.600603 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.600603= ?

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.600603.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.000603= approx 0.002154.

So sum is 2.14285714 +0.002154=2.145011.

So E=17.85714285 +2.145011=20.00215385 GeV.

So approximately 20.002 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is referring to the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) * m c².

If the question really asks for the kinetic energy, not the total energy, then K= (3.57142857 -1) *5.600603=2.57142857 *5.600603= approx 14.402 GeV.

But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the center-of-mass energy, but that's more complicated and I don't think is intended here.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula with the actual mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 5.6006 GeV. So E=gamma * m=3.57142857 *5.6006=20.002 GeV.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back, the options given are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So among these, option C is the only one in the ballpark of 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation:

E=gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.600603=20.002 GeV.

But that's nowhere near any of the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the mass is taken as 6 * m_p, leading to E=20.107 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps due to more precise calculations, the exact figure rounds to 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recompute 3.57142857 ×5.629632.

3.57142857 ×5.629632.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.629632.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.629632= ?

Let me compute 0.629632=0.6 +0.029632.

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.029632.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.02=0.0714285714.

3.57142857 ×0.009632=approx 0.03438.

Sum:0.0714285714 +0.03438=0.1058085714.

So 3.57142857 ×0.629632=2.14285714 +0.1058085714=2.2486657114.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2486657114=20.10580856 GeV.

So approximately 20.1058 GeV.

Hmm, but in the options, the only one close is option C)20.132, but that's 0.026 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses gamma as 3.57143, leading to a more precise calculation.

Let me compute gamma as 3.5714285714285714.

m=5.629632 GeV.

E=3.5714285714285714 ×5.629632.

Let me compute this using more precise steps.

3.5714285714285714 ×5.629632.

Multiply each part:

3.5714285714285714 ×5 =17.857142857142857.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.629632.

Compute:

0.629632 = 0.6 +0.029632.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428571423.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.029632.

Compute 3.5714285714285714 ×0.02=0.07142857142857142.

3.5714285714285714 ×0.009632=0.03438057142857143.

Add them: 0.07142857142857142 +0.03438057142857143 =0.10580914285714285.

So 3.5714285714285714 ×0.629632 =2.1428571428571423 +0.10580914285714285=2.248666285714285.

So total E=17.857142857142857 +2.248666285714285=20.105809142857142 GeV.

So approximately 20.1058 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation doesn't reach that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the question is using the relativistic energy in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rest frame of the nucleus, but that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the atomic mass of Li-6, including electrons, but that would be incorrect for a nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass), but that's roughly similar to 6 *0.938 GeV.

Wait, neutron mass is about 0.939565 GeV/c². So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be:

3 *0.938272 + 3 *0.939565 = 3*(1.877837) =5.633511 GeV.

So m=5.633511 GeV.

E=gamma * m=3.57142857 ×5.633511 = ?

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.633511= ?

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.033511= approx 0.119600.

So sum is 2.14285714 +0.119600=2.26245714.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.26245714=20.1196 GeV.

That's approximately 20.1196 GeV. Closer to option C's 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach, using the exact neutron and proton masses.

So the rest mass would be 3*(m_p) +3*(m_n). Given that.

m_p=0.938272 GeV/c².

m_n=0.939565 GeV/c².

So 3*(0.938272 +0.939565) =3*(1.877837)=5.633511 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.633511 =20.1196 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (^6Li) is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of the nucleus
The lithium-6 nucleus (\(^6\)Li) has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest masses of a proton (\( m_p \approx 0.938272 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)) and a neutron (\( m_n \approx 0.939565 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \)), the total rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 3 m_p + 3 m_n = 3(0.938272) + 3(0.939565) = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 20.1196 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated energy (\( \approx 20.1196 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
