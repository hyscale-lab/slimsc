Okay, so I've got this physics question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which of the four assumptions lead to the idea that nucleons behave like free nucleons in the impulse approximation. The options are combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

First, I need to understand what the impulse approximation is. From what I remember, in the impulse approximation, the interaction is treated as if it acts on a single nucleon, and the others are considered as a sort of spectator. So the idea is that the nucleons are almost free and that the nucleus doesn't significantly affect the interaction beyond the single nucleon.

Looking at the options:

Option 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Oh, right, that's a big part of the impulse approximation. Because if the interaction only affects individual nucleons, you can model each one separately, treating them as if they're free.

Option 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Transparent meaning that other nucleons don't affect the interaction much. So if the nucleus is mostly transparent except for one nucleon, that supports the idea that only that one is involved, like a free particle in a sense.

Option 3: The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks being non-relativistic... I'm not sure. I think this relates more to the internal structure. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their interactions are simpler, like in a nucleus where they don't move at speeds close to light. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, if the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the nucleon's structure is static, which might be part of treating the nucleon as a point particle or something. But I'm not as confident about this one.

Option 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. So the binding forces between nucleons are ignored. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as if it's free, so any binding is neglected. So this assumption would definitely contribute to that.

So the question is which combination of these leads to the approximation.

The impulse approximation is when you treat each nucleon as acting independently, like free particles. So the key
