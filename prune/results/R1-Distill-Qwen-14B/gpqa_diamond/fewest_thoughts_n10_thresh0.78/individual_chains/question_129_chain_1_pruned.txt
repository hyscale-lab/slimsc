Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds, A to E. I need to figure out what compound E is based on the reactions and some hints provided.

The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints given.

First, let's parse the information step by step.

Starting with the reaction steps. 

1. A + HCN â†’ B. HCN is a nucleophile, so in organic reactions, when such a reagent is used, it typically adds to carbonyl groups. So maybe A is a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone or aldehyde. Because HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin.

2. B is then reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation reaction, so if B is a nitrile (like from HCN addition), hydrogenation under Pd would add hydrogens. Wait, nitriles upon hydrogenation usually become amines, but wait, the conditions here are H2 and Pd. Oh, wait, maybe B is a ketone with a substituent that allows for addition of HCN? Alternatively, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with an OH and CN group adjacent.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is a cycloketone. Because the product after HCN addition could form a cyclic structure with an oxygen or another group. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible structures.

But let's look at the second step. B is reduced to C. If B is a nitrile, then hydrogenation would give an amine. But then, the next step is reacting with HNO2
