Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, wait, mixing an acid with a base? Oh right, they'll neutralize each other.

First, I need to figure out the total moles of each acid and base after mixing. Because when you mix them, the moles will determine how much of each is left after neutralization.

So, let's break it down. The first solution is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid. The second is 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, which is a strong acid. The third is 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. When you mix them all together, the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the base will react.

Wait a minute, but can the bases and acids completely neutralize each other? I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from acids and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, whichever is in excess will determine the pH.

Let me calculate the moles for each. 

Starting with CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but wait—since we're mixing it with strong acid and base, maybe I need to consider all the H+ contributions?

Wait no, HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl-. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely too. Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per formula unit, right? So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

So let's calculate each component:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.
But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all the H+ it has. However, when we add strong acid and base, the H+ from CH3COOH might not be the main factor. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps, in this case, since there's HCl present, which is a strong acid, it might affect the overall H+ concentration. I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.

Moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol. HCl → H+ + Cl-.
Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-. So each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 moles Ba(OH)
