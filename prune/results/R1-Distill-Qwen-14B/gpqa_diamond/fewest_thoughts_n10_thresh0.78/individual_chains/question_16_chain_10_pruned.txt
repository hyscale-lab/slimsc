Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one.

First, what's optical activity? Oh right, it's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when there's a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each compound for any such centers.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm. Let's draw its structure. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl, a double bond (to C2), maybe a methyl, and another group. Wait, but wait, wait. The structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Or maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. But but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the structure as CH2Cl connected to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps better to write it step by step. The formula is C4H7Cl. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C
