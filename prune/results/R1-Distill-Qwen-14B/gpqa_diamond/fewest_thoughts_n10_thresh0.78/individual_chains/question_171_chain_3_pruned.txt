Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. So the question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each substance undergoes this reaction, and we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, I remember that the position of substitution in aromatic compounds depends on the directing groups present.

Let me list the compounds again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxy ethylbenzene?)
Wait, no. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a benzoyloxy group attached to benzene. Benzoyloxy is a meta-directing group because it's an ester, which is electron-withdrawing. So it would direct incoming electrophiles to the meta positions.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
Chlorine is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So the incoming bromine would substitute at the meta position. Wait, but wait, in electrophilic substitution, for Cl, since it's an ortho/para director but deactivating. Wait, no, wait: I think I get this mixed up. Let me think. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group, which makes the ring less reactive, but it's ortho/para directing because the lone pairs on Cl can donate electron density through resonance. Wait, so for Cl, the substituent is ortho/para-directing but deactivating.

Wait, but wait, in a substitution reaction, if the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, and if deactivating, less reactive. So for toluene (methyl group), which is activating (ortho/para), the reaction would occur more readily. But in this question, all are undergoing substitution, so it's about the ratio of para to other isomers.

Each compound, when bromine is added in excess, will form a mono-bromo substituted product. But the position depends on the directing group.

Wait, but wait. The question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that can't be right because in reality, substitution can occur at multiple positions, leading to a mixture of ortho, meta, and para products. But the question says to assume that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, maybe that's a simplification. Or perhaps, because the substituent is a strong meta director, making para the major product? Or maybe each substituent directs the bromine to a specific position.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. So each compound, when brominated, will have substitution at certain positions, and we need to find the major product's position for each, then arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para isomer.

Wait, but the question says "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So for each compound, we need to determine the percentage of para isomer in the product. Then, arrange the compounds in increasing order of this percentage.

So first, I need to figure out for each substituent, whether the major product is para. Some substituents direct to para more than others.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: Toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine is added, the bromine will substitute at the ortho, para positions. But which is more favored? In toluene, the para substitution is usually the major product because the ortho positions are sterically hindered. So major product is para, so a higher weight fraction for para.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: The substituent is an ester group (COOEt). Esters are meta-directing because they are electron-withdrawing groups. So the incoming bromine will go to the meta position. So in this case, meta is the major product. So the para isomer is minor, so weight fraction is low.

Wait, but wait. The substituent is an ester group (like O-C
