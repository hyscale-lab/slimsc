Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. They want the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so reacting it with an acid should produce a salt and water. Since it's a monobasic acid, it will donate one H+ ion. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Right, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, and each HCl provides one H+.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I should calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- group is 17 g/mol (16 for O and 1 for H). So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 divided by 106.85. 106.85 is about 100, so 0.1/100 is 0.001, but 106 is a bit more, so maybe around 0.000936.

Wait, but another thought: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, it's a 1:3 reaction? Or wait, no. Let me write the balanced equation. Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl. Each OH- needs an H+ to become water. So Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH-, so it would need 3 H+ ions. So the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Oh right, so the mole ratio is 1:3. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, I need 3 moles of HCl.

So the moles of HCl needed are 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. So 0.000936 moles *3 = 0.002808 moles of HCl.

The acid available is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So the volume needed (in liters) is moles / concentration. So 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait. The options don't have exactly that. Let me look again.

Option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³. That's very close. Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the molar mass. Fe is 55.85, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Multiply by 3: 0.0028075 mol HCl.

Volume needed is 0.0028075 / 0.1 = 0.028075 L = 28.075 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³. That's about 28.08, which is close to option C's 28.05. Hmm, but why is option C the volume 28.05? Maybe I should be more precise with the molar mass.

Wait, let's calculate the molar mass again. Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So each OH- is 16.00
