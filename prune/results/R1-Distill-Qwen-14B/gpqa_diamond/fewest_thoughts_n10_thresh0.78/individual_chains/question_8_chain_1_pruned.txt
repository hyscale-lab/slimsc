Okay, I need to figure out which option is correct based on the experiment results. Let me read through the problem again.

So, the setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, are candidates for contributing to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. We knocked out each gene (g1, g2, g3) and made double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). We measured their resistance compared to the wild-type (100%).

The data we have is:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So, the wild type is 100%, and each mutant is below that. The question is about the interaction between these genes, particularly regarding transcription factors and epistasis.

We know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, perhaps it's involved in regulating other genes.

The options involve whether a particular gene is a transcription factor, possible pleiotropy, and epistatic relationships.

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. For example, if Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, then the presence or absence of Gene A can mask the effect of Gene B.

Pleiotropy refers to when a single gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure how that plays into this experiment.

Gene redundancy would mean that the function of one gene is duplicated by another. So, if one is knocked out, the other can compensate, but if both are knocked out, the effect is more severe.

Let me think about each gene's effect:

G2 knockout (g2) gives 0% resistance. That's the most severe. G1 knockout gives 75% and G3 gives 50%. So, G2's knockout is the most drastic.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (so, same as g2 alone)
g1g3: 10%
g2g3: 0% (same as g2 alone)
g3g1: 10%

Wait, so when G2 is knocked out (either in g2, g1g2, or g2g3), the resistance is 0% each time. That suggests that G2 is a critical gene, perhaps upstream of others.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So, their combined effect is worse than either alone. That might suggest that they're acting in the same pathway. If they were in separate pathways, you'd expect maybe additive effects, but here it's worse, so perhaps they function redundantly.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that knocking out both would be worse than either alone. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their double knockout would have lower resistance. In our case, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%â€”much lower. So that fits with gene redundancy. Because each gene alone provides some resistance, but if both are missing, the resistance drops much more, indicating that they normally work in the same pathway to provide resistance.

Now, looking at epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's effect is dependent on another. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then G2 would be epistatic to both. Because without G2 (the TF), the downstream genes can't function, leading to no resistance. 

Wait, in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of the other gene. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because the presence or absence of G1 or G3 doesn't matter if G2 is absent.

So, that would mean G2 is a transcription factor regulating the others. That makes sense because TFs are upstream regulators.

Now, looking at the other interactions. Let's see:

- When G2 is present, the other genes contribute
