Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. 

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, the field is radial, and its magnitude decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates can be a bit tricky. Since the field is only radial, the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the r component (which I think is f(r) in this case) is something like (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f(r)). Let me verify that. Oh wait, yes, the general expression for the divergence when the field is purely radial is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² F_r), where F_r is the radial component.

So, substituting f(r) into that formula. F_r is 1/r². So, compute the derivative of (r² * (1/r²)) with respect to r. Let's see: r² * (1/r²) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇·f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. What happens at r=0? Oh right, because the field behaves like 1/r², which might imply a point charge or something similar. But in reality, the divergence theorem comes into play here. The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field might have a singularity.

So to find the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R, I think I can use the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. The divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of that volume.

Alternatively, since the divergence inside the volume is zero except possibly at a point (the origin), the integral over any volume not including
