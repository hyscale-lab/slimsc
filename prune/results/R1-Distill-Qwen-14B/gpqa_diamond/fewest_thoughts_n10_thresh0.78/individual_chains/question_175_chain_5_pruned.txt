Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Okay, the question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. The radiation zone's power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and the form of f.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. For a spheroid along the z-axis, I think the radiation would be more along the z-axis, like a dipole radiation pattern.

Wait, dipole radiation. Right, the power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle theta. The radiation pattern for a dipole is something like sin(theta) squared, but I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to sin^2(theta), is that right? Or is there another dependency?

Wait, another thought. The power radiated by a dipole is given by the radiation resistance formula. The total power is (p^2 * omega^4)/(something), and the power per unit solid angle is (something) times sin^2(theta). So the maximum would be when sin(theta) is 1, i.e., theta is 90 degrees. Wait, but wait, wait. No, let me make sure. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis. Oh wait, wait, no, no. Wait, the dipole moment is along the z-axis. So the intensity falls off as theta increases. So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees, right? Because sin(theta) is 1 there. Wait, but that's in the transverse direction. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is when theta is 90 degrees. But the question is about theta=30 degrees.

So the maximum power is at theta=90, and the fraction at theta=30 would be (sin(30))^
