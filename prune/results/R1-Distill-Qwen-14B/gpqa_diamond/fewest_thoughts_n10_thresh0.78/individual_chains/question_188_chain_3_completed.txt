Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let me think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right? It's like a distorted cubic system where all the edges are equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees.

The given data are the interatomic distance, which I think refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. Oh wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So a = 10 Å. And all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all three angles can be the same, which makes it a special case.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the Miller indices vector. Or wait, more precisely, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ), but wait, that's when the lattice isn't cubic. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because in a cubic system, the formula is much simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or is it part of the cubic system? No, I think it's a separate system. But wait, in any case, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but here a = b = c because rhombohedral has all edges equal) and angles between them is needed.

Wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles are α, β, γ. So the formula for d_hkl would involve all three angles. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = (a^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^(-1/2) ?

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me think again. The general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ) )

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the denominator includes terms with cosines multiplied by the indices. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d_{hkl} = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hk cos β + hl cos γ) ]^(-1/2) * (a) ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula. Since I can't look things up right now, I need to remember. Oh wait, in the case of a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, so the cosine terms vanish, and it becomes d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for a general system, especially rhombohedral, the formula is more complicated.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral system, the lattice is defined by a basis with a, b, c all equal, and angles between them. The metric tensor comes into play here. The interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal of the Miller indices vector in reciprocal space, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = ( (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) )/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ) ) )^(1/2)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, the general formula for d is:

d = 1/ sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ) ) * (1/a) ?

No, wait, no. The correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think about the case when the angles are 90 degrees. Then, the formula reduces to d= a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), which is correct for cubic systems. So that part makes sense.

In this problem, the Miller indices are (1,1,1). So h = k = l =1.

Given that, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2*(1*1 cos α + 1*1 cos β + 1*1 cos γ) )

Wait, but all angles are 30 degrees, so cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator step by step.

Compute the numerator terms:

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Now the subtracted terms:

2( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma )

Since h=k=l=1, this becomes 2*( (1*1)*cos 30 + (1*1)*cos 30 + (1*1)*cos 30 )

Which is 2 * [ (3 terms each of 0.8660) ]

So 2*(3 * 0.8660 ) = 2 * 2.598 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that can't be right because you can't have a negative value inside the square root. So that suggests I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but if that's the case, with the given parameters, the denominator becomes 3 - 2*( (1*1 * 0.866) *3 ), which is 3 - 2*(2.598) = 3 -5.196 = negative number. That's impossible because sqrt of a negative isn't real. That can't be correct.

Hmm, this suggests I must have the wrong formula. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. For a general hexagonal crystal, the formula is different, but rhombohedral is a subset of hexagonal? Or is it a different system?

Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, where a = b = c and angles α = β = γ, the formula can be simplified.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

Wait, because in this case, all the angles are the same, so β=γ=α=30 degrees. So the denominator becomes:

3 - 2*(3 * (hk + hl + kl) * cos α )

Wait, but in our case, h=k=l=1, so hk=1, hl=1, kl=1.

So denominator is 3 - 2*( (1+1+1)* cos 30 )

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) 

Simplify that:

3 - 2*( (3*sqrt(3))/2 )

The 2 and denominator 2 cancel, so 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

What's 3*sqrt(3)? Approximately 3 * 1.732 = 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196 again. So that's the same problem.

Wait, so getting a negative under the square root can't be correct. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, no, that might not be correct either. Because in the cubic case, when angles are 90, the cos terms are zero, so it reduces to a / sqrt(h² +k² +l² ), which is correct.

Wait, maybe I have the sign wrong. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma ) )

But wait, that would make the denominator in our case 3 + 2*(3 * 0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is about 2.863. Then d would be 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Å. But that doesn't match any of the options given, which are around 8.9 to 10. So that can't be right either.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Another approach: For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can also be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos α + kl cos α) )

But wait, all angles are same, so α=β=γ=30°. So in our case, (hkl)=(1,1,1).

So denominator becomes:

3 -2 [ 3 * (1)(1) cos 30° ]

Which is 3 - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2) )

So 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196

Again negative. That's impossible. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a different arrangement of the terms. Maybe the denominator is (h² +k² + l²) + 2( ... ) because the dot product in the metric tensor is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal lattice. Because in crystallography, the reciprocal lattice vectors are involved in calculating d-spacings.

Wait, the formula for d is 1/|G|, where G is the vector in reciprocal space. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) ) ) * a

Wait, but that brings us back to the same problem.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to find the volume of the unit cell and then compute the d-spacing. The volume V is a^3 multiplied by sqrt(1 - cos^2 α - cos^2 β - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma) ) ? Or wait, that's for the volume of a general hexagonal unit cell. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula from the book. Like, in Ashcroft-Mermin or another solid state physics textbook. But I don't have the book here.

Wait, I found another approach. Maybe using the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the structure factor. Or perhaps using the relation involving the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another formula I remember is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, but that would apply only if all angles are the same, which they are in this case. So, for a rhombohedral system, with α=β=γ=30°, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(3)(cos 30°) )

Wait, 3 because h=k=l=1, so hk + hl + kl = 3.

So cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So denominator is sqrt(3 - 2*3*(0.866) ) = sqrt(3 - 5.196) = sqrt(-2.196). Oh no, that can't be. So this suggests that the formula must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that would make the denominator bigger, leading to a smaller d.

In our case, 3 + 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196. sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈3.493 Å. But that doesn't match any options provided. So, this can't be correct either.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the formula involves the cosine of the supplement angle? Like 180-30=150°, but cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

Wait, if the angles are defined as the angles between the edges, but in some conventions, the angles are the angles between the edges when projected onto a different plane. Wait, no, I think in the standard notation, for a rhombohedral system, the angles α, β, gamma are the angles between the edges a, b, c; so, for example, α is the angle between b and c, etc. So if all are 30 degrees, that would make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's consider the Miller indices (111). The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but in this case, all α, β, gamma are 30°, so:

= a / sqrt( 3 - 2[ (1)(1) cos 30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ] )

= a / sqrt( 3 - 2*(3 * 0.8660) )

= a / sqrt( 3 - 5.196 )

= a / sqrt( -2.196 )

Wait, that's impossible. Negative under the square root. That can't be right. So perhaps I have the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the formula for rhombohedral is different because all the angles are the same. Let me think about the relation between the reciprocal lattice and the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is actually a special case where the formula can be simplified.

Wait, another thought: For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice can sometimes be another rhombohedral system. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the dot product of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm.

Wait, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a* )^2 + (k b* )^2 + (l c* )^2 )

Where a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a_0, and the angles are same. So the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated based on the metric tensor.

Wait, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

g = [ [ a², a² cos gamma, a² cos beta ],
       [ a² cos gamma, a², a² cos alpha ],
       [ a² cos beta, a² cos alpha, a² ] ]

Wait, but perhaps when all angles are the same, gamma = alpha = beta = 30°, then the metric tensor becomes:

g_11 = a²
g_12 = a² cos 30°
g_13 = a² cos 30°
g_21 = a² cos 30°
g_22 = a²
g_23 = a² cos 30°
g_31 = a² cos 30°
g_32 = a² cos 30°
g_33 = a²

Wait, but the reciprocal metric tensor (g*) is needed to compute the reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors a*, b*, c* can be found as:

a* = ( (b × c) ) / (a·(b × c)) )

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal metric tensor g* is the inverse of g.

So, the reciprocal metric tensor g* is such that g_ij * g^ij = identity.

But perhaps for a rhombohedral system, given that a = b = c and angles are same, the reciprocal vectors have a simpler form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by a*, b*, c*, where a* has magnitude 1/a, but direction determined by the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d_{hkl} can be expressed as:

d = 1 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

Wait, but that's not correct because when a is not 1, but in our case, a is 10. So perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma )

Wait, but that's what I thought earlier, but the denominator ends up negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Wait, in the metric tensor, the off-diagonal terms are cosines of angles. But perhaps in the reciprocal, the signs change.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, let me test that.

In our case,

h=k=l=1, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so cos 30 ≈0.866.

So denominator is 3 + 2*(3 * 0.866 ) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Å. But that's way smaller than the options given. The options are around 9-10 Å.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Maybe the formula uses 2*(hk cos gamma + ... ), but with a plus sign.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But as I did before, leads to d=3.49. Doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps I should think that in a rhombohedral system, the angles used in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors, which might be different.

Wait, another approach: For a rhombohedral crystal, the (111) planes are the same as in a cubic system, but the interplanar distance is affected by the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos 60° )

Wait, why 60? Because if the angles between the vectors are 30°, perhaps the angle in the formula is 60°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in a cubic system, the angle between lattice vectors is 90°, so cos is zero. If in this case, the angle is 30°, perhaps the formula uses 60°, which is 180-30=150? No, wait, 180-30=150, and cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2≈-0.866.

Hmm, trying that:

Denominator = 3 - 2*(3) * (-0.866) = 3 + 5.196 =8.196.

Same as before, so d=3.49. Still too low.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos 60° )

Wait, cos 60 is 0.5.

Denominator =3 + 2*(3)*0.5 =3 +3=6. sqrt(6)=approx 2.449.

d=10 / 2.449≈4.082. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Maybe it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos 150° )

Because 150 degrees is 180-30. cos(150) is -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator:

3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866) =3 + 5.196=8.196. Again, same issue.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

But in this case, if alpha is 30°, then as before, denominator is negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's think about another way. Maybe the interatomic distance is not a, but something else. Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance might refer to the nearest neighbor distance, which in a cubic system is a√2 or a√3, but in this case, it's a rhombohedral system.

So, perhaps a is not the lattice parameter. Wait, but in a cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2 for a face-centered cubic and a√3 for body-centered. But in a simple cubic, it's a. But in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance would be different.

Wait, but the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So perhaps in this crystal, the nearest neighbor distance is 10 Å. So, the lattice parameter 'a' is such that the nearest neighbor distance is 10.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the nearest neighbor distance would be a, because each atom is at a corner of the rhombohedron. Wait, no, in a simple cubic system, the nearest neighbor is along the edges, so distance a. But in a rhombohedral, the edges are a, so the distance between nearest atoms would be a as well. So a is 10.

So, a=10 Å.

But then, why is the denominator in the formula negative? I must have the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Wait, with alpha=30°, cos(30)=0.866.

So denominator =3 + 2*(3 * 0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863. So d=10/2.863≈3.49 Å. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are around 8.9 to 10. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the inverse. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/(a^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma)/(a^2)

So,

1/d^2 = (3)/(10^2) - 2*(3 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) / (10^2)

Wait, that's 3/(100) - 2*(3 * 0.866)/(100)

= (0.03) - (2 * 2.598)/100

= 0.03 - 0.05196

= -0.02196

Which would give 1/d^2 negative, which is impossible. So this suggests the formula is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to recall that in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes can sometimes have d-spacings that are larger than the lattice parameter, depending on the angles.

Wait, but with the angles being 30°, perhaps the layers are further apart.

Wait, let me try to compute 1/d^2 using the formula.

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma)

But in our case, that's 3 - 2*(3 * cos 30° )

Which is 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2 )=3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈3 -5.196= -2.196.

So 1/d^2 is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I have the formula inverted.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )^{-1} * a^2

Wait, but then d^2 = (denominator)^{-1} * a^2.

Wait, but if denominator is (3 -5.196)= -2.196, then:

d^2 = (-2.196)^{-1} * (10)^2 → negative, which can't be.

So I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible options and see which one makes sense.

The options are around 9-10. So 8.95, 9.08, 9.54, 10.05.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the case where the denominator is positive.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos α )

So, using this formula with cos 30 =0.866.

Denominator =3 + 2*(3 *0.866 )=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Å. No, that's too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos(180 - α) )

Because in some conventions, the angle between vectors is the supplementary angle.

So cos(150)= -0.866.

Then, denominator =3 - 2*(3*(-0.866)) =3 +5.196=8.196.

Again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have the angles as 180 - alpha, beta, gamma. Because sometimes, the angle between two edges in the crystal is the angle you get when you look at it, but the actual angle in the formula is the angle between the lattice vectors, which might be 180 minus the given angle.

So, for example, if the given angle α is 30°, the actual angle between the vectors is 150°, so cos would be cos(150)= -0.866.

So, substituting that into the formula.

1/d^2 = (3) - 2*(3*(-0.866) ) → 3 + (2*3*0.866 )=3 +5.196=8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196) →10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Å.

Still way off the options.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the edges as viewed in the conventional cubic system, but in reality, the angles for the crystal are different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (h k + h l +k l) cos alpha ) 

But in this case, h=k=l=1, so:

d =10 / sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*0.866 ) → sqrt of negative number. Impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (h k cos alpha + h l cos beta + k l cos gamma) )

But with all angles of 30°, which gives 3 - 2*(3*0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196. So can't compute real d.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I'm missing a key point here.

Another approach: Perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the (111) planes are in a direction where the interplanar distance is larger.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of the formula.

Wait, when the denominator in the formula is negative, perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, d = a / sqrt( |3 -5.196| ) → a / sqrt(2.196 )

sqrt(2.196)= approx 1.48.

So d=10/1.48≈6.76 Angstrom. Still not matching any options.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the question is misprint, and the angles are 120°, not 30°, but that's just a guess.

But given the problem as stated, perhaps I should try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for d is:

d = [ (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2 hk cos alpha - 2 hl cos beta - 2 kl cos gamma) ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, let's compute that.

a=10, h=k=l=1, angles=30°.

Numerator:10^2 *3=300.

Denominator:3 -2*(3 * 0.866 )=3 -5.196= -2.196.

So 300 / (-2.196)= -136.6.

Taking square root: sqrt(-136.6) is imaginary. Not possible.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the edges. Wait, no, the angles between the edges are alpha, beta, gamma.

Wait, maybe the formula should use the supplement angles, like 180 -30=150°, with cos(150)= -0.866.

So, 1/d^2 = (3) - 2*(3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. Still too small.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Like, d = a * sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + ... )) )

But that would give a larger d. So for our case, sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196). Nope.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given and see which one makes sense.

The options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Wait, 10 is the lattice parameter. So for (100) planes, d would be 10. For (111), it's shorter, but in some cases, it can be longer. Wait, no. Wait, in a cubic system, (111) has d = a / sqrt(3) ≈5.77. But in this case, given the angles, the d could be larger.

Wait, but how? Because if the angles are 30°, the planes might be closer together or further apart.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk cos alpha + ... ) )

Which in our case would be 3 + 5.196=8.196. So d=10/2.863≈3.49. But that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the reciprocal.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) ) ) 

But that would ignore the angles, which doesn't make sense for a non-cubic system.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another formula. Maybe using the relation between the face-centered cubic and rhombohedral systems. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the relation:

d = a * sin(theta) / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)^0.5 

But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / [ sqrt( (1 + 1 +1) - 2*(1+1+1) cos 30 ) ]

So,

=10 / sqrt(3 -6*0.866 )

=10 / sqrt(3 -5.196 )

=10 / sqrt( -2.196 )

Which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe I should just pick the option that is approximately 10 * sqrt(3/ ... )

Wait, wait, perhaps the denominator should be positive. Let me try to compute 3 - 2*(3 * cos 30° )=3-5.196= -2.196. Taking the absolute value, 2.196.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/(~1.48)=6.76. Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the formula for rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

So, as we did before, 3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=~2.863. d=3.49 Å. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 180 -30=150°, so cos= -0.866.

So denominator =3 -2*(3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196. d=3.49.

Nope.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the angles are 60 degrees. Let's try that.

cos(60)=0.5.

Denominator=3 -2*(3*0.5 )=3 -3=0. So d approaches infinity, which isn't possible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral. Maybe the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha ) )

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) is given by:

d = a / (sqrt(3) ) * sqrt( (1 + cos alpha ) )

Wait, let's compute that.

sqrt(3)=1.732. cos 30=0.866.

So sqrt(1.866)= approx 1.366.

So d=10/(1.732) * 1.366 ≈5.77 *1.366≈7.88. Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) * (1 + cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) ) )

No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the triple product or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + ... ) )

But that brings me back to the same problem.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the answer options. The options are all around 9-10. So perhaps the correct answer is 10 / sqrt(1) =10, but that's for (100) planes, not (111). So not this.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance when the angles are 30 degrees is such that the denominator becomes sqrt(1/3).

Wait, no, 3 - 2*(3 * cos 30 )=3 -5.196=negative. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the formula for the interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

But I'm just making this up now, which isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which, as before, gives 3.49.

But that doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos alpha) )

Hmm, but that would make the denominator even larger, leading to smaller d.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another formula I found online (but can't access now) is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So, using that, the denominator is 8.196, d=3.49.

Which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the angles between the planes. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos gamma) )

But for our case, it's 3 -5.196= -2.196. So, perhaps taking the absolute value, 2.196.

So d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48=6.76. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different convention, like the angles are the ones between the crystallographic axes, but considering the octant. So, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150°, making cos negative.

So,

d=10/sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos 60 )

cos 60=0.5.

Denominator=3 +3*(1) =6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.082. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos 60 )

=10 / sqrt(3-3*0.5 )=10 / sqrt(1.5)=10/1.225≈8.155.

Which is close to option B)8.95.

But wait, how did I get 8.155? That's around 8.15, which is close to option B of 8.95. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, 3 - 3 *0.5 =3-1.5=1.5.

sqrt(1.5)= approx 1.2247.

So 10/1.2247≈8.16. But the closest option is B)8.95.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 180-30=150°, so cos= -0.866.

So, denominator=3 -2*(3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49. No.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which in our case is:

d=10 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(3 -5.196 ) → denominator is imaginary. Can't do.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which gives us 3.49. But this doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)8.95, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which in our case is 10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt( negative ), which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos (180 - alpha) )

Which would be:

=10 / sqrt(3 -2*(3)*cos(150° ) )

=10 / sqrt(3 -2*3*(-0.866) )

=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10/ sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

No.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all the possible ways, but I can't get to any of the options. However, the options are all around 9-10, which suggests that perhaps the formula for (111) in this case gives a larger d than a.

Wait, how? Maybe the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / sqrt( ... )

But that's just a guess.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system is a. So a=10.

But, in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be larger than a if the angles are small.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk cos alpha + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But in our case, that's 3 -5.196= -2.196. So, perhaps the reciprocal.

Wait, but then d^2 would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which in our case is 10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49. Doesn't match.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) * sqrt( 1 + something )

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the volume of the unit cell and use that to find d. The volume V is a^3 * sqrt( 1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30°, so:

V = a^3 * sqrt( 1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8 )

=1 - 9/4 + (3√3/4 )

= (4/4 -9/4) ) + (3√3/4 )

= (-5/4) + (3√3/4 )

= [ -5 +3√3 ] / 4

√3≈1.732 →3√3≈5.196.

So,

[ -5 +5.196 ] /4 = (0.196)/4=0.049.

sqrt(0.049)=0.221.

So, V=10^3 * 0.221=2210 Å^3.

Wait, but how does that help with the interplanar distance?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) ) * something involving the volume.

But not sure.

Another thought: Perhaps the (111) planes have a larger d-spacing because the angles are small. For example, in an fcc structure, (111) has a larger d-spacing than (100), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in this case, the lattice parameter is 10, and the angles are 30°, which might make the planes expand.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos alpha) )

But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 + cos alpha) )

But this would be even larger.

Wait, this is taking too long, and I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option B)8.95 Å, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, if I take 1/d^2 = (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + ... ) * cos alpha.

But with the negative denominator, perhaps taking the reciprocal as if it's positive.

So,

d=10 / sqrt(2.196)≈6.76. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options, but I'm not confident.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma)}}
\]

### Given Data:
- Lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \)
- Miller indices \( h = k = l = 1 \)
- Angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \)
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \)

### Substituting into the Formula:
1. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]

2. Compute the subtracted terms:
   \[
   2(hk \cos \alpha + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \gamma) = 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 5.196
   \]

3. Compute the denominator inside the square root:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
   \]

4. The denominator becomes negative, which is unphysical for real \( d \). This suggests either the formula may need adjustment or the interpretation of the angles might differ.

### Attempts to Adjust the Formula:
- Considering the supplementary angle \( 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \), where \( \cos 150^\circ = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx -0.866 \), the denominator becomes:
  \[
  3 - 2(3 \cdot -0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
  \]
  This result is too small compared to the given options.

- Trying alternative adjustments to the formula, such as using absolute values or different conventions for angles, still does not yield a result close to the provided options.

### Analysis of Options:
The given options are:
- \( 9.08 \, \text{Å} \)
- \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \)
- \( 9.54 \, \text{Å} \)
- \( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \)

These values are much larger than the computed \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), suggesting a possible misinterpretation of the formula or the angles. However, based on the options, the closest plausible answer is \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \), which aligns with the expectation that the interplanar distance for (111) in a rhombohedral system could be slightly smaller than the lattice parameter \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \).

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in the formula and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
