Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration problems. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Let me first visualize what's happening. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. Right.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes.

So, initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 20 to 40 doubles the volume, but halves the concentration. 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, the titration. We're titrating this 0.025 M acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So, first, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let's compute that.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles (from before). Moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 as well, because each mole of acetic acid reacts with a mole of NaOH.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So at 25% titration, how much NaOH is added? 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So, that's 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Let me outline what I need to do for each part.

At 25% titration:

1. Calculate moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.
2. Determine moles of acetic acid and acetate after reaction.
   - Initial: 0.001 moles CH3COOH.
   - Moles reacted: 0.00025 (since NaOH is limiting, but wait, if we're only adding 2.5 cm³, which is 0.00025 moles, then the reaction would be:
   CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.
   So, moles CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
   Moles acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.
3. Now, find the concentrations in the solution. But wait, the total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.
   So, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ ? Let me calculate. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.
   [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.
4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log
