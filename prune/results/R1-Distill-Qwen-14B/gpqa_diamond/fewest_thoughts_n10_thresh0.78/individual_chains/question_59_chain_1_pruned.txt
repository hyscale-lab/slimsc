Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because there are multiple acids and a base involved. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But since there are multiple acids and a base, I need to figure out the net reaction. I'll probably have to calculate the moles of each acid and base and see which one is in excess.

Let's start by calculating the moles for each solution. 

The first solution is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. The moles of acetic acid would be Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. So, 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate, but maybe that doesn't matter right now because I'm looking at the neutralization first.

Next, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Moles are 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, I need to figure out the net reaction between the acids and the base. The total H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so maybe its H+ contribution is less? Hmm, but for the neutralization, maybe I should consider all possible H+ sources.

Wait, no, perhaps I should first consider the neutralization between the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Because HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. When H+ and OH- react, they form water.

So, the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ and OH-:

HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 contributes 0.18 moles of OH-.

So, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. Let's see which is in excess.

Total H+ available: 0.08 + (maybe some from CH3COOH, but since it's weak, perhaps I should treat it as a separate step.)

Wait, I think I need to consider all H+ sources for the neutralization. So, the H+ comes from HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH. But since CH3COOH is a weak acid, only a small amount will dissociate. But during neutralization, the strong HCl will donate a lot of H+.

Wait, maybe I should first combine the H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2. Let's see:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol

They react as H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.08 mol H+ will neutralize 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- in excess.

Wait, but wait. Also, the acetic acid solution contributes some H+ as well. So, the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute a lot of H+ initially. But when you mix everything, the solution's pH depends on the net H+ or OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- from the base will react with all the H+ available, including from the weak acid.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from all the solutions and see the net.

Wait, let's think again. The total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in pure solution, it doesn't dissociate much. But when mixed with a strong acid and a strong base, perhaps the H+ from HCl will be in excess, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will
