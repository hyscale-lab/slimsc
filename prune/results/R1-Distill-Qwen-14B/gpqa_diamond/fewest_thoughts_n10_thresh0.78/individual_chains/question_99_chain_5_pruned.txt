Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group since I see COOH in each. Let's go through the data step by step.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that a broad peak around there typically indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since all the options have a COOH group, that makes sense. Then, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. That's a carbonyl group, which fits with the carboxylic acid as well. So the IR data is consistent with all options.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The question says there are several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens—so no allylic or vinyl protons. That means the structure doesn't have any unsaturated (like double bond) groups. All four options are alkanes with a COOH group, so that's fine.

The NMR has some specific signals. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated splitting. Let me think about what that implies.

The splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. Let's break down each splitting:

- A doublet means each proton is split into two by one neighboring set. So, each H is next to one proton on a neighboring carbon.

Wait, no. Wait, the splitting is about the number of neighboring Hs. So, a doublet (n=1) would come from coupling with a neighboring group with one H. A triplet (n=2) is from two adjacent Hs, and so on.

Wait, but the splitting is sequential. So a doublet of triplets would be the result of coupling with two different sets of Hs. For example, each H is coupled with two different groups, each causing a split.

So, let's say the first split is a doublet (coupled to one H), and then each of those is split into a triplet (coupled to two H's), so each of the doublet's peaks becomes a triplet, making a doublet of triplets? Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, maybe it's a first-order splitting, so each coupling is considered separately.

Wait, another approach: the splitting pattern is a series of multiplications. For example, a doublet (from one neighbor) would split the peak into two. Then, another coupling (like a triplet) would further split each of the two into three, resulting in a doublet of triplets. So the order matters. But honestly, I might be overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from being adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, maybe each proton is next to two different groups of protons, each causing a split.

Let me think about the structure possibilities. The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So, this is something like a geminal di-substitution—wait, wait, the structure would be CH2(C)(C) CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to two ethyl groups and two CH3 groups? Let me parse the formula carefully.

Wait, the formula for each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure would be:

The central carbon (maybe the second C in the chain) is attached to a CH3, a C2H5, a CH2COOH group, and another C2H5? Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C
