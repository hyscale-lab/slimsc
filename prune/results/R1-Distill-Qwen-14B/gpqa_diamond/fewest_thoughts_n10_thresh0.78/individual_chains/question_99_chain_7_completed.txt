Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct structure based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR. The options are four different structures, all of which have a COOH group, so they're carboxylic acids. That's a key point.

Looking at the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. The other strong peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). So that fits with the COOH group as well.

Now moving on to the 1H NMR. The problem states there are several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds or aromatic rings here. All the hydrogens are probably in aliphatic regions.

Some of the signals in the NMR are a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns and what structures cause such complex splits.

In NMR, when a proton is split by neighboring protons, the splitting can become complex if there are multiple neighboring groups. For example, a doublet of triplets might mean the proton is next to two sets of neighboring protons. Let me try to visualize.

Looking at the options, all of them have a structure where there's a central carbon attached to two other carbons, each of which has branches. Let me sketch each structure:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, maybe I should parse it correctly. The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Hmm, so the central part is two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 group and a CH3 on one carbon. So, perhaps a structure like:

CH3-C(CH2CH3)(CH(CH2CH3))CH2COOH? Wait, maybe the central part is two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups. Hmm, perhaps it's a geminal di-substituted group. Maybe each CH is connected to another CH, each bearing ethyl groups.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more like this: the central part is (CH(CH2CH3))2CH-CH2COOH. So the molecule has two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon, which is also attached to another CH group. Or maybe it's a case of two CH groups each attached to ethyl and another CH.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH group is attached to two ethyl groups: so each CH is connected to an ethyl and a CH2CH2... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So another structure where the central part is a CH group attached to CH3 and another CH attached to CH3. So perhaps it's (CH2CH3)C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)COOH. So each CH is attached to a methyl group and another group.

Wait, maybe each of those CH groups is attached to two methyl groups? No, because in the formula, it's written as C(H)(CH3) for each. So each CH has one CH3 group and perhaps some other substituents.

Wait, maybe each CH is connected to a methyl and another CH. Let me think. So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the COOH is attached to a carbon which is connected to another carbon (CH(CH3)), and that carbon is connected to a CH2CH3 group.

So the part before COOH is CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH? No, the COOH is the end group, so perhaps it's CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. That would make the structure have a central part with two CH groups, each attached to a CH3 and an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure like: 

- CH3CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, wait, each CH is attached to a methyl and another CH?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the splitting patterns. The NMR has a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that each proton is split by multiple neighboring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of vicinal coupling (J between adjacent carbons) and more. For example, if a proton is next to a carbon that has multiple protons, which in turn are adjacent to more protons. Let me think of a structure where a CH group is next to another CH group, which is next to another CH group, etc.

Looking at option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the two middle CH groups each have a CH3 attached, and they're connected to each other, and then a CH2COOH.

In this structure, each CH group is attached to a CH3 and another CH. The CH groups are adjacent, so their protons would couple with each other. But wait, let's see. The middle is two CH groups, each attached to a CH3 and the other CH.

So each of these CH protons would be next to each other. Let's say H on C2 is next to H on C3. But each C2 and C3 has a CH3. So maybe the protons on C2 are split by the protons on C3 and also by any other adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the three coupling constants are causing the complex splitting. Let me think about how the splitting would work.

If the CH group is adjacent to another CH group, each with their own sets of neighboring protons, the coupling can lead to multiple splits. For example, if a proton is on a CH that is adjacent to another CH which is itself adjacent to another CH, the splitting could become a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, perhaps looking at the structure in option D. Option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two central CH groups each have a CH3 and are next to each other. Then, each CH is attached to a CH3 and an ethyl group.

In this structure, the CH groups would have protons that are adjacent to each other. So the protons on these CH groups would couple with each other. Additionally, each CH is a CH group, so each has one H. Wait, each C has two Hs? No, the formula says C(H)(CH3), which implies a CH group, so each has one H. So the two CH groups are each bearing one H and attached to a CH3 and the adjacent CH group.

Wait, so each H on C2 (the first CH) is next to the H on C3 (the second CH). So each H would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent H. But wait, that would be a simple doublet.

But the NMR data shows more complex splitting. So perhaps there are more neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl groups (CH2CH3) are causing some splitting.

Hmm, wait, in option D, the ethyl group is on the first CH. So the CH2CH3 is attached to C1, which is attached to C2 (which is CH). So the H on C2 (CH) would be adjacent to the H on C1's CH2 group. Wait, but C1 is CH2CH3, so the H's on C1 are CH2, which may split the H on C2.

Wait, perhaps the H on C2 (the CH) is next to the H's on C1 (the CH2CH3 group). So the H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2. So each H on C2 would be a triplet because they're next to two equivalent H's on C1.

Wait, but if the H on C2 is split by the two H's on C1's CH2, that would be a triplet. Additionally, the H on C3 (the other CH) would also be adjacent to the H on C2, leading to further splitting.

So let's model this:

- H on C2 is next to:

   a) the two H's on C1's CH2 group (so splits into a triplet)

   b) the H on C3 (so splits into a doublet)

So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets. That's one possibility.

But the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which is more splitting. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more adjacent groups. Let's consider option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

So the first CH is attached to a CH3 and an ethyl group. The second CH is attached to two ethyl groups and a CH2 group. So the H's on each of these CH groups would be coupled with each other and with the H's on the adjacent CH groups.

Wait, but let me think about the coupling. The H on the first CH (C2) is adjacent to the ethyl group (C1) and the H on C3 (the next CH). The H on C3 is adjacent to the ethyl groups on C4 and the H on C2, and also perhaps the CH2 group on C4.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 (the second CH) is next to the H's on the adjacent CH2 group (since it's connected to CH2-COOH). Or maybe not, depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the second CH (C3) is adjacent to the CH2 group. So each H on C3 would be split by the H's on C2 and the H's on C4 (if any).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused, but maybe the splitting comes from multiple adjacent groups. Let me think about each H and how many neighboring Hs they have.

In option D, the two CH groups are next to each other, each with one H. Each CH is attached to a CH2CH3 and a CH3. So the central part would have CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, the H on C2 (the first CH) is attached to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C1 (the CH2 group) and the H on C3.

So the H on C2 would be split first by the two H's on C1 (CH2CH3), which would give a triplet. Then, this triplet would be split again by the H on C3, giving a doublet for each line in the triplet. So that would be a triplet of doublets, or a doublet of triplets, depending on the order.

Wait, but in NMR splitting, the order doesn't matter; it's the product of the splits. So for each H, the number of splits is the product of the neighboring groups. So if a proton is split by two neighboring groups, each with n and m lines, the total splitting is n*m.

So for H on C2: adjacent to two H's on C1 (CH2CH3) => 3 lines (triplet), and adjacent to H on C3 => 2 lines (doublet). So overall, 3 * 2 = 6 lines. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which would appear as a doublet of triplets when the coupling constants are different.

So that would produce a doublet of triplets, which matches part of the NMR data. But wait, the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. So that suggests another level of splitting, maybe from a neighboring group with three H's.

Hmm, perhaps the CH groups are connected to a group with more H's.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option C is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH3 and the adjacent CH.

In this case, the H on C2 (CH) is adjacent to the H on C3 (another CH) and the H's on C1 (CH3 doesn't contribute, but wait, C1 is CH3, which is attached to C2. So the H on C2 is only adjacent to the H on C3. Wait, but C1 is CH3, which is a methyl group. So the H on C2 is only adjacent to the H on C3. So each H would be a doublet, but maybe more splitting comes from elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group at the end (CH2COOH) has two H's which are adjacent to the H on C3. So the H on C3 would be adjacent to the two H's on CH2, leading to a triplet. And also adjacent to the H on C2, leading to a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is 6 lines, as before.

Wait, but in option C, the CH2 group is after the two CH groups. So the structure is CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the H's on the CH2 would be adjacent to the H on C3 (the second CH). So each H on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on C3, causing a doublet. But the CH2 group is probably a triplet due to their own coupling.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting off track. Let me focus on the splitting described in the NMR. One signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which is a more complex splitting than just a doublet of triplets.

How could that happen? Maybe the proton is coupled to three different types of neighboring protons. For example, a proton next to three different groups with different coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a central CH group that's connected to two other groups, each with their own sets of H's. Maybe the CH is connected to a CH2 group and another CH group, each with multiple protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a branching that leads to each H being split by multiple adjacent H's. For example, if a CH group is next to a CH2 group and another CH group, each contributing their own coupling.

Let me think of the option A structure: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl (C2H5) group, and the other end is a CH2COOH.

So each CH group is attached to an ethyl group and another CH. So the H's on each CH would be adjacent to the H's on the ethyl groups and the H's on the other CH.

Wait, in this structure, the H on the first CH (C2) is attached to C1 (CH3) and C3 (another CH). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H's on C1 (CH3 has no H's attached, wait no, C1 is CH3, which is a methyl group connected to C2. So C2 is CH, attached to C1 (CH3) and C3 (CH). So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3, and the CH3 on C1 doesn't have any Hs on the same carbon, so maybe only coupling with C3.

Wait, but the ethyl group is on C2 and C3. Wait, no, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each CH (C2 and C3) has an ethyl group (C2H5) attached. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 (CH group) and perhaps the H's on the ethyl group attached to C2.

Wait, no, the ethyl groups are on C2 and C3. So each CH (C2 and C3) has an ethyl group, but the ethyl groups are on C2 and C3. So the H on C2 is attached to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH), and the ethyl group (C2H5). So the ethyl group is on C2, so the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's H's? No, because the ethyl group is attached to C2, but the H's on the ethyl are on the CH2CH3 part. So the H on C2 would be adjacent to the ethyl group's H's? No, because the ethyl group is attached to C2, but it's a branch, so the H's on the ethyl are not adjacent to the H on C2.

Ah, right. So in option A, the H on C2 (CH) is adjacent only to the H on C3 (CH) and maybe the CH3 on C1. Wait, but C1 is CH3, so the H's on C1 are on the same carbon as C2. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 and any H's on C2's substituents, but the substituents are ethyl groups, which are branches. So the H on C2 doesn't have adjacent H's from the ethyl groups.

So the H on C2 is only next to the H on C3, which is a CH group. So each H would be a doublet. But the problem states more complex splitting, so perhaps this structure isn't the one.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH group. So each H is being split by multiple groups.

Hmm. Let me think about option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each CH is attached to an ethyl group and another CH. The H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH and the ethyl groups.

Wait, but the ethyl groups are on the same carbon as the CH. So the H on C2 (CH) is attached to C1 (CH2CH3) and C3 (CH). The H on C2 would be adjacent to the H on C3. Also, the ethyl group on C2 is CH2CH3, which has its own H's. But the H on C2 isn't adjacent to those H's because the ethyl is a branch. So the H on C2 would only be adjacent to the H on C3, leading to a doublet.

But the problem mentions more complex splitting. So perhaps the correct option has a structure where the CH groups are adjacent to more than just one other H.

Wait, perhaps option A is the correct one. Let me think again. Option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

So the H on C2 (the first CH) is adjacent to the H on C3 (the second CH) and the CH2 group (C4). Wait, no, C4 is CH2 attached to COOH. So C3 is the second CH, then C4 is CH2.

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C4 (CH2), which has two H's. So the H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4, giving a triplet, and also by the H on C2, giving a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is 6 lines. That would fit the description of a doublet of triplets perhaps, but the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which is four levels of splitting. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe another approach: looking for the number of unique environments. The NMR shows several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl H's. But that doesn't help much.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure has a geminal di-substitution, leading to more complex splitting. For example, two CH groups adjacent to each other, each with two substituents.

Let me think about the coupling between the CH groups. If each CH has substituents leading to multiple coupling, that could cause complex splitting.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the structure has a central CH2 group that's causing the splitting. For instance, if the CH is adjacent to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH, the coupling can cascade, leading to more splits.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an ethyl group attached to a CH, which in turn is attached to another CH and a CH2 group. So each CH has multiple neighboring H's.

Wait, another thought. The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is likely O-H from the carboxylic acid. The 1700 peak is the carbonyl. So the structure is a carboxylic acid with some branching.

Looking at the options, all have COOH, so that's covered.

Now, the NMR shows that none of the H's are vinyl, so no double bonds. Also, the splitting suggests that certain H's have several neighboring H's.

In the 1H NMR, the splitting for a proton is determined by the number of neighboring (vicinal) H's on adjacent carbons. So each H's signal is split by H's on adjacent carbons.

In option A, the structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

The H on C2 (the first CH) is adjacent to the H on C3 (CH) and perhaps the ethyl groups on C2 and C3. But the H on C2 isn't adjacent to the ethyl H's because they're on branches.

So, the H on C2 is adjacent only to the H on C3. So each would be a doublet.

The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C4 (CH2). So each H on C3 would be split by the two H's on C4 (CH2), giving a triplet. Additionally, the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2, so each line of the triplet would split into a doublet. So the H on C3 would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets when considering the order.

Wait, that would make the H on C3 a doublet of triplets, but the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, not quite matching yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is further down the chain, so the H on C3 is adjacent to the CH2, which in turn is adjacent to another group. So that would add another split.

Wait, perhaps the H on C4 (CH2) is adjacent to the H on C3 (CH) and the H on C5 (if any). But in this structure, C4 is CH2 connected to COOH, so no C5.

So the H on C4 (CH2) is adjacent to the H on C3 (CH) and the two H's on the other side (the CH2 group). So each H on C4 would be split by the H on C3, leading to a doublet, and by the adjacent H on the same CH2, leading to a triplet. So the H on C4 would be a triplet of doublets, but that's the same as a doublet of triplets.

But the question mentions a more complex splitting, like a doublet of triplet of quartets. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each CH is adjacent to two CH groups. For example, a structure like CH2CH2... no, that's not correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure has a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH group. So the H on the middle CH2 would be split by both adjacent CH groups.

But in this case, the H's on the CH2 would be split by the two adjacent CH groups, each of which has one H. So each H on CH2 would be a quartet, because each H is split by two adjacent H's (each from the CH groups). Wait, each H on CH2 would couple with two H's from each adjacent CH, but since each CH has only one H, the coupling would be to two different H's, each with the same J. So the H on CH2 would be a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). Wait, no, the formula is n = number of neighboring H's. So if a proton is next to two H's, it's a triplet. But if it's next to two different sets of H's, perhaps it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the H on the CH2 is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H. So each H on CH2 would be split into a triplet (from each CH's H). But since there are two CH groups, each contributing one H, perhaps the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a CH group is adjacent to a CH2 and another CH, leading to three different coupling constants.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The H on C2 (CH) is adjacent to the H on C3 (CH) and the ethyl group on C1 (CH2CH3). The H on C2 would couple with the H on C3, and perhaps also with the H's on C1's CH2.

Wait, the ethyl group is on C1, which is CH2CH3. So the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2, which has two H's. So the H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and by the H on C3 (doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is a doublet of triplets when considering the order.

So that H would be a doublet of triplets.

Another H in the structure is on C3. The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C4 (COOH group is on C4, but that's a carbonyl, so no H's there), and the H on C2. So the H on C3 would be a doublet due to C2's H. But perhaps there's another split from elsewhere.

Wait, but C3 is attached to a CH3 group. So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the CH3 on C3. But the CH3 doesn't contribute any adjacent H's, so the H on C3 would be a doublet.

But the question states that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which is more complex. So perhaps option D isn't the one.

Wait, perhaps the H on C1's ethyl group is split by the H on C2. The CH2CH3 group on C1 would have H's that are adjacent to the H on C2. So the H's on C1's CH2 would be split by the H on C2, leading to a doublet for each H on CH2.

But each CH2 has two H's, and they're equivalent, so the CH2 group would be a doublet. But the CH2 is part of an ethyl group, so its H's would be a quartet due to splitting by the H's on C2, which is adjacent. Wait, no, the ethyl group's CH2 is adjacent to C2's CH. So the CH2 group's H's would each be split by the H on C2.

Each H on ethyl's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on C2, so each would be a doublet. But since there are two H's on the CH2, they are equivalent, so the CH2 group would be a doublet of quartets? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is split by the H on C2, leading to a quartet. Because each CH2 H is adjacent to one H on C2, so each would be a doublet, but since there are two H's on the CH2, it's a quartet.

Wait, the number of splits is given by n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H's. So if a CH2 group is adjacent to one H (on C2), each H on CH2 would be split into a doublet. But since the two H's on CH2 are equivalent, the overall splitting for the CH2 group would be a triplet? No, wait, if each H is split into a doublet, the CH2 group would have two doublets, but since they're equivalent, perhaps it's a quartet. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group's CH2 is split by the H on C2, leading to a quartet. So the ethyl group's CH2 would have a quartet. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

This is getting a bit tangled, so maybe I should approach it differently. Let's look for which option has a structure where a CH group is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is in turn adjacent to another CH group. That would create a situation where a proton is coupled to three different sets of H's, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Looking at the options, perhaps option A is the correct one because it has a CH2 group at the end (CH2COOH), which could be adjacent to a CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, option A's structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the H on the last CH2 is adjacent to the CH group (C3), which is attached to an ethyl group. So each H on CH2 would be adjacent to the H on C3, which is a CH group. So the H's on CH2 would be split into a doublet by the H on C3. But since the CH2 has two H's, the splitting would cause a quartet, perhaps.

Wait, if a proton is adjacent to another proton with J coupling, it becomes a doublet. But when there are two H's on the same carbon adjacent, it can lead to more splitting. But I'm getting a bit lost here.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 (the second CH) is adjacent to the CH2 group (C4) and the H on C2. So the H on C3 would be split by the H on C2 (doublet) and by the two H's on C4's CH2 (triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

If this is the case, the H on C3 would be a doublet of triplets, which matches part of the description. Then, the H's on C4's CH2 would be split by the H on C3 (doublet) and perhaps by any other adjacent H's. So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, leading to a quartet for the CH2 group.

Wait, that would make the CH2 group a quartet. So in the NMR, the CH2 group would be a quartet, and the H on C3 would be a doublet of triplets. That matches the data in the question, where one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is being split by the H on C3 and by another group. For example, if the CH2 is split by the H on C3 (doublet) and perhaps another H on a neighboring group, leading to a quartet.

But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Another way is to think about the number of unique protons in the structure.

Looking at option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The H's on C2 and C3 are each attached to a CH3 and the adjacent CH.

So, the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 and the CH2CH3 on C1. The H on C2 is also adjacent to the CH2CH3 group, which has two H's. So the H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and by the H on C3 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets (or vice versa).

The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the COOH group (which doesn't contribute H's). So it would be a doublet.

The CH2CH3 group on C1 would have H's that are adjacent to the H on C2. So each H on the CH2CH3 (except the one at the end) would be split by the H on C2, leading to a doublet. Since the CH2CH3 group is an ethyl group, the H's on the CH2 would be a quartet due to coupling with the H on C2.

Wait, but the ethyl group's CH2 is split by the H on C2. Each H on the CH2 would be a doublet, but since there are two H's, the overall splitting would be a quartet.

So in this structure, the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets, the H on C3 would be a doublet, and the ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet.

So the NMR would show a quartet from the ethyl's CH2, a doublet from C3's H, and a triplet of doublets from C2's H. Additionally, the COOH proton would appear as a broad peak, but since it's a carboxylic acid, it's usually not observed in 1H NMR due to exchange broadening, unless under specific conditions.

But the question states that none of the NMR peaks correspond to vinyl H's, which is consistent.

So, considering the splitting patterns, option D's structure would have a H on C2 that is a triplet of doublets (or vice versa), which is a complex splitting, but does it match the given data of a doublet of triplet of quartets?

Hmm, perhaps not exactly. The question says one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which implies three levels of splitting. Maybe that's because the H is coupled to three different sets of H's.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The splitting in NMR is determined by the number of neighboring H's on adjacent carbons. Each split comes from a neighboring set.

If a proton is adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with two H's, then the splitting would be 2+1 * 2+1 * 2+1 = 3*3*3=27? No, that's not right. Wait, each split is multiplicative. For each set of n neighboring H's, the number of splits is n+1.

So if a proton is adjacent to three different sets of H's, each with two H's, the total number of splits would be (2+1)^3 = 27. That's a lot, but the question mentions a doublet of triplet of quartets, which would be 2 * 3 *4 =24 lines? Hmm, that's not matching exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is adjacent to one set of two H's, another set of two H's, and another set of three H's. So the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1)*(3+1)=3*3*4=36 lines. That's way more than what's observed.

Wait, maybe the proton is adjacent to one set of two H's and another set of three H's. So (2+1)*(3+1)= 3*4=12 lines, which is a quartet of triplets or a triplet of quartets.

Ah, so if a proton is adjacent to two H's on one side and three H's on another, the splitting would be a triplet of quartets or a quartet of triplets. That matches the description in the question where one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Wait, no, it's a doublet of triplet of quartets.

Hmm, perhaps the proton is adjacent to a set of one H, a set of two H's, and a set of three H's. So (1+1)*(2+1)*(3+1) = 2*3*4=24 lines. That's a doublet of triplet of quartets, which matches the description.

So, which structure would have a proton adjacent to groups with 1, 2, and 3 H's?

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A has such a structure.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the H on the first CH (C2) is attached to CH3 (C1), another CH (C3), and an ethyl group (C2H5).

The H on C2 is adjacent to:

- The ethyl group (C2H5) on C2. Wait, the ethyl group is a branch, so the H on C2 is not adjacent to the ethyl's H's.

- The H on C3 (CH group).

- The CH2 group on C4.

Wait, C4 is CH2 attached to COOH, so the H on C4's CH2 is adjacent to the H on C3.

But the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 and the H's on C4's CH2. Wait, no, the H on C2 is on C2, and C4's CH2 is two carbons away. So the H on C2 isn't adjacent to C4's H's. So the H on C2 is adjacent only to the H on C3.

So, the H on C2 would be split into a doublet by the H on C3.

The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the H's on C4's CH2. So the H on C3 is adjacent to two H's on C4's CH2. So the H on C3 would be split into a triplet by the two H's on C4, and also split by the H on C2 into a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is 6 lines.

The H's on C4's CH2 are adjacent to the H on C3. Each H on CH2 would be split by the H on C3 into a doublet. But since there are two H's on CH2, the splitting would be a quartet. So the CH2 group would be a quartet.

Putting it all together:

- H on C3: triplet of doublets (6 lines).

- H on C4's CH2: quartet.

- H on C2: doublet.

But the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2, the two H's on C4's CH2, and another group. Wait, but in this structure, what's next to C3? It's attached to C2 and C4. So the H on C3 is only adjacent to the H on C2 and the two H's on C4's CH2.

So that's two sets of neighboring H's: one from C2 (1 H) and one from C4 (2 H's). So the splitting would be (1+1)*(2+1) = 2*3=6 lines, which is a triplet of doublets or doublet of triplets.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplet of quartets, which implies three levels of splitting. So perhaps another structure in the options has such a scenario.

Wait, maybe option A's structure has the H on C3 adjacent to the CH2 group (2 H's), the H on C2 (1 H), and another group with 3 H's. But I don't see that in this structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a CH group is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group, creating a situation where the H's are split by multiple sets.

Let me think about option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

The H on C2 (CH) is adjacent to the ethyl group on C1 (CH2CH3), the H on C3 (another CH), and perhaps the H's on C3's ethyl group (but those are branches, not adjacent).

So the H on C2 is adjacent to the H on C3 and the two H's on C1's CH2.

So the H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and by the H on C3 (doublet). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, which is 6 lines.

The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the two H's on its own ethyl group (C2H5), but those are branches, so the H on C3 is only adjacent to the H on C2, making it a doublet.

The ethyl groups' H's would be split by the H on C2. For example, the H's on the CH2 of C1's ethyl group would be adjacent to the H on C2, leading to a doublet. But since there are two H's on the CH2, the splitting would be a quartet.

So in this structure, the H on C2 is a triplet of doublets, the H on C3 is a doublet, and the ethyl's CH2 groups are quartets.

But the question states that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which doesn't quite fit here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the option where a CH group is adjacent to a CH2 group that is itself adjacent to another CH group, leading to three levels of splitting.

Wait, option A's structure is:

CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the CH2 group (C4). The CH2 group's H's are adjacent to the H on C3 and perhaps the H's on C5 (if there was a C5, but there isn't). So the H's on CH2 are a quartet due to the H on C3.

The H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the two H's on C4's CH2. So the H on C3 would be split by C2's H (doublet) and C4's CH2 (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So the H on C3 would be a doublet of triplets. The CH2 group's H's would be a quartet.

So in the NMR, we would see:

- The H on C3: doublet of triplets.

- The CH2 group: quartet.

- The H on C2: perhaps a triplet due to the ethyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's H's (CH2CH3 on C1) and the H on C3.

So the H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and the H on C3 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. So perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to three different groups: the H on C2, the two H's on C4's CH2, and maybe another group.

But I don't see another group that the H on C3 would be adjacent to.

Wait, perhaps the H on C3 is also adjacent to the H's on C4's CH2 and perhaps the H on the CH2 group is also adjacent to another H, leading to another split. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering the correct substituents. Let me try to visualize the structures again.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

H on C2 (CH) is adjacent to the ethyl group (CH2CH3 on C1) and the H on C3 (CH).

H on C3 (CH) is adjacent to the H on C2 and the COOH group, which doesn't contribute H's.

So, H on C2 is split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and the H on C3 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.

H on C3 is split by the H on C2 (doublet).

The CH2 group on C1 (ethyl) has H's that are split by the H on C2 (doublet), giving a quartet.

So in the NMR, the signals would be:

- H on C2: triplet of doublets.

- H on C3: doublet.

- CH2 (ethyl): quartet.

But the question mentions a signal that is a doublet of triplet of quartets, which doesn't quite match.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is option A, where the H on C3 is adjacent to the CH2 group, which is adjacent to another group, leading to more splits.

Wait, in option A, the CH2 group (C4) is adjacent to the COOH group. So the H's on C4's CH2 are adjacent to the H on C3 (CH) and perhaps the H's on the COOH group, but the COOH doesn't have H's. So the H's on CH2 are only adjacent to the H on C3.

So each H on CH2 would be a doublet, and since there are two, the CH2 group would be a quartet.

So the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2 and the two H's on CH2. So the H on C3 is split by the H on C2 (doublet) and the two H's on CH2 (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

So in the NMR signals:

- H on C3: doublet of triplets.

- CH2 (C4): quartet.

- H on C2: adjacent to the ethyl group's H's (CH2CH3 on C1) and the H on C3.

So H on C2 would be split by the two H's on C1's CH2 (triplet) and the H on C3 (doublet), leading to a triplet of doublets.

Additionally, the H's on the ethyl group's CH2 (C1) are adjacent to the H on C2, so each H is split into a doublet. But since there are two H's, the CH2 group would be a quartet.

So in option A's structure, the NMR would show:

- H on C2: triplet of doublets.

- H on C3: doublet of triplets.

- CH2 groups (C1 and C4) as quartets.

This matches the description in the question, where one signal is a doublet of triplets and another is a quartet.

Wait, but the question mentions a signal that's a doublet of triplet of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is a doublet of triplets of quartets, meaning it has three levels of splitting. How would that happen?

Maybe the H on C3 is adjacent to three different groups: the H on C2, the two H's on C4's CH2, and another group with three H's. But I don't see another group in option A's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on C3 is adjacent to the H on C2, the two H's on C4's CH2, and the two H's on C1's CH2. But since C1 and C4 are two carbons away, their H's aren't adjacent. So the H on C3 is only adjacent to the H on C2 and the two H's on C4's CH2.

Wait, that's two neighboring groups: one with one H and another with two H's. So the splitting would be (1+1)*(2+1)=2*3=6 lines, which is a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But the question mentions a more complex pattern, so I'm not entirely confident. However, based on the FTIR and NMR data, the structure that fits best is option D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The FTIR data shows a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a carbonyl. The broad peak at 3000 is O-H from a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a carboxylic acid.

In the 1H NMR, the absence of vinyl H's suggests no double bonds. The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets suggests a proton that's coupled to three different groups with 1, 2, and 3 H's on adjacent carbons.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option A is the right choice because it has a CH2 group that leads to a quartet, and the CH groups lead to more complex splitting.

But I'm still not entirely confident. Another thought: the number of signals in the NMR would depend on the number of unique proton environments. All options have multiple CH groups and CH2 groups, so they would have several signals.

But perhaps the correct structure is option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

In this structure, the H on C2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2 (two H's) and the H on C3 (one H). So the H on C2 would be a triplet of doublets. The H on C3 would be a doublet, and the ethyl's CH2 would be a quartet.

This matches the description of a triplet of doublets for one signal and a quartet for another.

Wait, but the question says one signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because the other options don't fit as well. I think I've spent a lot of time on this, and I'm leaning towards option D, but I'm not entirely sure.


To identify the compound, the spectroscopic data provided was analyzed:

### FTIR Data:
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
