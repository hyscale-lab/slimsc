Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me parse the structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde), and also attached to a methyl group. That methyl group is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the structure is something like:

O=CH-Cyclohexane-C(OH)(Cyclohexyl)CH2?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO). Then, at the 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde), there's a substituent: a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So, the substituent is a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane ring at the position adjacent to the aldehyde.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-C≡CH) attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡C- attached to the cyclohexane. So, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Wait, no, ethynyl is -(CH2)n-CC#CH where n is the position. Wait, maybe I should think about it as the cyclohexane has a substituent that's a propargyl group? No, wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

So, the starting material is cyclohexane with a triple bond: like cyclohexylacetylene. So, the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane— the ethynyl is attached directly to the ring. So, it's cyclohexane with a substituent of -C≡CH. So, maybe it's cyclohexane with a carbon attached to the ring, which is triple bonded to another carbon (the ethynyl group).

Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2-C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. No, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, ethynyl would
