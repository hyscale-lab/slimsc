Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about two chemists talking. The second chemist says, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." I need to figure out what that means in a chemistry context.

Hmm, the question is a bit of a riddle, but I think it's a play on words. The phrase "on top of each other" probably refers to something happening in the lab. Let me think about common lab scenarios.

So, maybe the compounds aren't separating properly. Like, when you have a mixture and you try to purify it. If they're not separating, they'd be on top of each other. That makes me think of chromatography or maybe distillation. In chromatography, if compounds have similar polarities, they might elute together, meaning they don't separate and come out at the same time. Or in distillation, if their boiling points are similar, they won't separate into different layers.

Wait, the options are about different properties. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Similar polarities. So, if compounds have similar polarities, they might not separate in a chromatography column. They'd run together, so they would be on top of each other because they move at the same rate.

Option B: Non-covalent interactions. If they interact a lot, maybe they'd form a solid or not separate. But I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option C: Similar boiling points. That would affect distillation. If you're trying to distill them, similar BP would mean they don't separate into different fractions. So during distillation, they'd stay together, maybe in the same phase.

Option D: Optical rotation. That's about chirality, maybe. But how would that cause the compounds to be on top of each other? I'm not sure that ties in here.

So, the original scenario is in a synthetic organic chemistry lab. They might have been trying to purify a mixture. If the compounds are hard to separate, they'd be on top of each other. So either chromatography issues (polarities) or distillation issues (boiling points).

Wait, the initial comment is about the compounds being "on top of each other." That makes me think of layering. Like, after an extraction where you have different layers. If two compounds are in the same layer because they're miscible, they wouldn't separate into different layers. But if their densities are different, they'd form separate layers. So, this might not be about extraction layers.

Alternatively, in thin-layer chromatography (TLC), if two compounds have the same polarity, they'll both climb the plate at the same rate and appear as a single spot. So the compounds are on top of each other because they can't be separated. That would fit with option A.

But what about distillation? If their boiling points are too close, they won
