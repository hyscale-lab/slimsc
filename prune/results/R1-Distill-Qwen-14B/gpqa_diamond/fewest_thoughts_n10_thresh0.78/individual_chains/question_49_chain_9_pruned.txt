Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question gives three different reactions and asks me to determine the products A, B, and C from the given options. Let me try to break each one down.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form product A.

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a compound with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. Structure-wise, that would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, because it's ethan-1-amine, so the amine is on the first carbon of ethane. So, the structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. Oh wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both methoxy groups are on the first carbon. So, it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me sketch it: the ethanamine has two CH3O groups on the same carbon as the NH2. So the structure is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2?

But then it's reacting with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 2? Wait, but numbering is from the end with the hydroxyl group. So butane has four carbons. Numbering from the OH, which is on C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C2. So, structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? Hmm, no, perhaps it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol
