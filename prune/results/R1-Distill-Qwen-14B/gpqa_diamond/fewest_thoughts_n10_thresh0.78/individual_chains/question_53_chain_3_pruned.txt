Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals: two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons (with specific splitting patterns), and two for methyl groups. There are no signals for CH2 groups. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. First, di-substituted benzene rings have two substituents attached. Since it's a six-membered aromatic ring, I'm thinking of structures like para-substituted, meta, or ortho. But the substituents are probably not the same because it's di-substituted, but maybe they are.

The presence of an ester group (from IR) suggests that the compound has a structure where an oxygen is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen is also connected to an OR group. Esters generally have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So I'm thinking that maybe one substituent is an ester group, like an aryl ester or an alkyl ester.

Looking at the NMR data: six signals in total. Let's dissect each part.

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals. So on the benzene ring, there are two sets of aromatic protons. That could mean that the ring has two different types of protons. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the aromatic ring would have two equivalent protons in the ortho positions and two in the meta. Wait, no, wait. Wait, di-substituted benzene rings with two different substituents can have different splitting. Let me think. If it's para-substituted with two different groups, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. For example, two substituents in para positions would leave each of the adjacent positions (ortho) and the other two (meta) as equivalent. Hmm, but if the substituents are different, then the ortho and meta protons might not be equivalent.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons split into two signals. Like one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and another substituent is something else. Or perhaps both substituents are ester groups, but that seems less likely because di-substituted. 

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group and another is a vinyl group. Wait, the NMR has two vinyl protons. Wait, the vinyl protons are in two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps there's a vinyl group attached, maybe part of an ester or another substituent.

Wait, another thought: the ester group itself could be part of the substituent on the benzene ring. For example, the substituent could be an ester group like OCOOR or maybe an acetoxy group or something similar.

But wait, the di-substituted ring
