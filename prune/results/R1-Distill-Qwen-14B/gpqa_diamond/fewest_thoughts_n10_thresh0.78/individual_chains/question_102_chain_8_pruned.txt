Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about genetics and molecular biology. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, a bicistronic vector has two genes (in this case, ligand and receptor) under a single promoter, allowing both to be expressed as a single transcript but translated into two separate proteins. The vector uses internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other elements to do this.

So, the vector structure: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element, which I believe allows the ribosome to translate the second ORF without the need for another promoter. 

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the CBA promoter drives the transcription of both the ligand and receptor. The IRES after the receptor would help in the internal initiation of translation, but wait, the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the transcript goes ligand ORF, then IRES, then receptor ORF. So the first cistron is ligand, and the second is receptor.

But the vector uses loxP and lox2272 cassettes with stop signals. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. So without Cre, the stop signals prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins. But with Cre, which recognizes lox sites, the cassettes would be excised, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different site-specific recombination sites. Cre recombinase can recognize loxP sites, but not lox2272. Conversely, the Dre recombinase recognizes lox2272. So if you have a vector with a loxP and lox2272, and you use Cre, only the loxP cassettes would be cut. But in this case, the ligand is under a loxP cassette and the receptor under a lox2272.

Wait, no— the ligand's ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop with loxP. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, then loxP sites. So when Cre is introduced, it would cut the loxP sites, removing the stop and allowing the mCherry to be expressed in frame with ligand? Or wait, the ligand is ORF, then a stop, then loxP. So without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But with Cre, the loxP sites are cut, and the stop is removed, so the mCherry is now in frame with the ligand, allowing it to be expressed.

Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with eGFP at C-terminus. Between receptor and eGFP is a stop with lox2272. Since Cre doesn't cut lox2272, the stop remains. Unless another recombinase like Dre is used, the eGFP is not expressed. Hmm, but the question says they used Cre. So the eGFP should not be expressed because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

Wait, but in the experiment, the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre is expressed, which should excise the loxP sites in the vector.

So the expected outcome would be that the ligand is expressed along with mCherry (since the stop after ligand is removed), and the receptor is expressed but with the eGFP not being expressed because the lox2272 remains. Or wait, no— the receptor is in
