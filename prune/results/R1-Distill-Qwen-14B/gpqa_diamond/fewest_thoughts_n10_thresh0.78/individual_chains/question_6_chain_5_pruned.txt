Alright, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2) k r² plus (3/2) k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, which means we'll have to solve the Schrödinger equation for this potential and find the energy levels.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. In two-dimensional problems, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, it's often helpful to separate variables or look for symmetries. Oh wait, this potential looks like it might be separable into radial and angular parts.

Let me expand V(r,θ). The first term is (1/2) k r², which is like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, that cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2) k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2 *1/2)=3/4, so (3/4) k r² (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I miscalculated. Let me redo that. The second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. So substituting cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, this becomes (3/2) k r² * (1/2)(1 + cos2θ) )= (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the total potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ )

Let me expand that:

= (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Combine the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4 k r². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait a minute, wait. Wait
