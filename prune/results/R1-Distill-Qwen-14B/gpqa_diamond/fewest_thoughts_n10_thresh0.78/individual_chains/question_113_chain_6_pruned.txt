Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Let's see what each piece of data tells me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol. But wait, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which usually suggests a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like C=C with some electron-withdrawing groups—like in an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but if there's a peak at 1650, that's a bit lower than a regular carbonyl. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps an amide? But wait, in this case, the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe a ketone with adjacent double bonds.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means there's a C=C double bond, so the compound has an alkene group. So, the structure must have both a carbonyl group and an alkene. And since the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks, maybe it's an ester or something with two different carbonyls. Wait, wait, wait. Or maybe it's a conjugated system. Like a carbonyl group and a double bond nearby. For example, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like in an enone.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about that. What fragments have a mass of 45? One possibility is a CH3CO+ ion, which would be (12+16+16+1=45?), wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate. CH3CO+ is (12*2 + 1*3 + 16) = 24 +3 + 16 =43. No, that's 43. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's propionyl (CH2CH2CO?), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group? Or maybe it's an acetyl group in some other context. Alternatively, 45 could be from a fragment like (CH3COO-) but that's 45? Let me think: CH3COO is (12+3*1) + (12 + 16*2) ? Wait, no. Wait, the molecular formula for CH3COO- is C2H3O2^- which is 2*12 +3 +2*16 = 24+3+32=59, which is higher. Hmm. Maybe it's a different fragment.

Wait, another possibility is that the fragment is from a benzene ring. But wait, benzene would be more than 45, so probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group or something else. Let me think of all the possibilities. The fragment at m/z 45. So, what compounds have a mass of 45? Let's calculate possible combinations. 

Carbon: 12, Hydrogen:1, Oxygen:16, Nitrogen:14, etc. Let's try to find a group that adds up to 45. For example, a CH3CO (acetate) ion would be 43, as I thought earlier. Or a CH2CH2O group? No. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2O+? Let's see: CH2CH2O is C2H4O. The molecular weight would be 2*12 +4*1 +16 = 24 +4 +16=44. That's 44, but the peak is at 45. So that's not it. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the fragment is (CH3COO). Wait, that's 2 carbons, so 24 + 3 (from CH3) + 16*2 (from O2) = 24+3+32=59. No, that's too big. Hmm.

Wait, what about something like an ethyl group with an oxygen? Or maybe a CH2CH3O+? Let's see: C2H5O. Molecular weight is 2*12 +5*(1) +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! That's it. So the fragment is C2H5O+ which is 45. So, the molecule probably has an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, perhaps as an ester or an ether.

So putting it all together. The structure has a carbonyl group (from the IR peaks) and a vinyl group (from the NMR), and in the mass spec, a fragment at 45 suggests an ethyl group attached to oxygen, perhaps an ester group.

Now looking at the possible formulas. The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas—let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2.

C=6, H=12.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1.

So one DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. But considering the IR has a carbonyl (so one double bond), and the NMR has vinyl H (another double bond), so that's two. DoU would be (2*6 +2 - 12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. Wait, that's only one. Hmm, but if there are two double bonds, that would require a higher DoU.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalibrate. Let me re-calculate DoU.

DoU = [2C +2 - H - X + N)] / 2.

So for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

Does that make sense? If the molecule has a carbonyl (one double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that's two DoU. So this formula would have only one, which is conflicting.

Wait, so maybe I'm doing this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure includes a ring and a double bond. Let me think. For example, a cyclic ester (like a lactone) would have a ring and a carbonyl. That would account for one DoU (ring) plus one from the carbonyl (total 2), but the formula would require DoU of 1. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute for all options:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one degree: could be a ring plus a double bond, but wait, a ring is one, a double bond another. So that's two, but the DoU is only 1. So that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. Wait, maybe I should include O in the calculation? No, O is not counted in the DoU formula.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation. For option A, the formula is C6H12O2.

So:

DoU = (2*6 + 2 -12 - 0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 1.

So one DoU. So maybe the molecule has a ring and a carbonyl group. Because a ring is one DoU, a carbonyl is another, but that would require two. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the molecule has an ester group, which is a carbonyl, and perhaps a ring. So that would give one degree of unsaturation from the ring and one from the carbonyl, totaling two, but the formula only has DoU one. So that's a problem. So perhaps option A can't have both a ring and a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of the ring, making it a lactone. Let's think about that.

Wait, a lactone is a cyclic ester, which would have a ring (one DoU) and the ester carbonyl (another DoU, as it's a double bond). So that would require a total DoU of two. But option A's DoU is one. So that's a problem. So perhaps option A isn't right.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoUs. So maybe a ring and an alkene. But what else? Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which would be a DoU. So if the molecule has a ring (DoU 1), a carbonyl (DoU 1), that's two. That matches. So this could be possible. But then, what about the mass spec and the other data?

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so an alkene. So that's another DoU. Wait, that would be three DoUs. So that's a problem. Because option B's DoU is two. So that can't be. So maybe option B is not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2.

So two DoUs. So that could be a ring and an alkene, or two double bonds.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl and something else. Let me think. If the compound has a carbonyl (one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU), that adds up to two. So that fits. So perhaps it's an ester with an alkene.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the presence of a double bond. So the structure could be an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group.

So for example, something like methyl vinyl ester. Or perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Alternatively, think about the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is C2H5O+. So that suggests an ethyl group attached to an oxygen. So perhaps the ester group is ethyl, like an ethyl ester.

So the structure could be an ethyl ester with a vinyl group. For example, ethyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOEt. Let me check the formula.

Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. Because CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, and ethyl is C2H5. So total C3+C2=5? Wait, no, wait: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2. Then ethyl is C2H5, but the ester is O-linked. So the structure is CH2=CHCOO-C2H5.

So the molecular formula is C5H8O2? Wait, wait. Let me count. CH2=CHCOOEt: CH2=CHCOO is three carbons, and Et is two carbons. So 3+2=5 carbons?
