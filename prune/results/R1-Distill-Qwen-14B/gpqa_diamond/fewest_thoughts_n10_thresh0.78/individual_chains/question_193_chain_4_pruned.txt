Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, and I'm a bit confused, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, right. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, or N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant of proportionality.

Wait, but what's parallax in terms of distance? Oh right, parallax (often denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula for parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, wait—I think the exact formula is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, because distance in parsecs d is 1 parsec when plx is 1. So plx and d are inversely related: as d increases, plx decreases.

So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So I can substitute plx in terms of d into the equation for N. Let's do that. Since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/d gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Let me calculate that. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, I think the question is asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance. So it's not the total number up to a distance r, but how the density changes with r.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of stars per unit volume. Because when you count stars in a region, the number depends on the volume, but stars are spread out. But in this case, the question is about how it varies with distance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number density, like the number per unit distance. Let me think: the number of stars
