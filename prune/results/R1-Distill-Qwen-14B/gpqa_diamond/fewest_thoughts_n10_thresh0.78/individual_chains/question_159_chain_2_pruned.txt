Okay, so I'm trying to solve this cosmology question about the comoving distance to a quasar. Let's see. The question gives some observations from a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, emission lines like the Lyman-alpha can be redshifted, which affects the observed wavelength.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at about 121 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that's a redshift. The formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121 is about 6.5289. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5289. Wait no, wait, wait. Oh wait, no, wait. Because if the emission line is at 790 nm, which is longer than the rest frame, so that would imply that the source is moving away, so z is positive. So z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1 gives z ≈ 5.5289. So z is about 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is the distance to the object, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = a * ∫ (from 0 to z) [1/(H0 * E(z))] dz, where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ). Since the universe is flat, Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.

The parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7. And a=1 because we're looking at the current scale factor.

So first, I need to compute the integral from 0 to z=5.5 of 1/(H0 * E(z)) dz, then multiply by a (which is 1) to get D_c.

But wait, how do I calculate this integral? Hmm, I think I remember that for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, the comoving distance can be found using certain approximations or integrating numerically.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance. Let me recall. For low redshifts, like z <<1, the integral can be approximated, but here z is about 5.5, which is pretty high. So maybe use an approximate formula or a table.

Wait, I think the integral is ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / [H0 * E(z')], where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_Λ).

Hmm, so this integral is dimensionless, and when multiplied by c/(H0), gives the comoving distance in units of Mpc. Wait, no, wait: the integral is in terms of 1/[km/s/Mpc * sqrt(...)], which is a bit messy, but perhaps the standard approach is to look for approximate expressions or use known values.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula for the comoving distance in a ΛCDM universe. I think that for high z (like z>1), the comoving distance increases, but the expansion history slows it down because dark energy becomes dominant.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact value, but I think that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is roughly around 10-12 billion parsecs. Wait, but the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.

Wait, I should probably look for a way to compute this. Maybe I can use a calculator or an approximate formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the comoving distance for high z can be approximated using the formula D_c ≈ (c/H0) * f(z), where f(z) is a function that depends on the cosmological parameters. But I'm not sure about the exact form
