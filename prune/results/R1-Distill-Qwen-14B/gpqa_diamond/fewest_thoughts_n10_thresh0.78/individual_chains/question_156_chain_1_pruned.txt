Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes.

The scenario is that a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about what the chemist observes in each chromatogram.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction produces.

Starting with Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is trans (E), the epoxide formation will depend on the geometry. Wait, wait—epoxidation by mCPBA typically proceeds via a cyclic transition state, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide structure.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. For an E-alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when the epoxide forms, the groups on adjacent carbons will be trans. So from (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be... Let me imagine the structure. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, wait, more accurately, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no; more accurately, it's CH2CH2CH2CH
