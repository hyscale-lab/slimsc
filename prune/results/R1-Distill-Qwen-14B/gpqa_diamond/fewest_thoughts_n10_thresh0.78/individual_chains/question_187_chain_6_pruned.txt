Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars meet that criteria.

From what I remember, the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's mounted on the VLT (Very Large Telescope), which has 8-meter mirrors. So the telescope's collecting area is big, which helps gather more light.

The stars given are options a) Canopus, b) Polaris, and options c to f, which are all stars with the same absolute V magnitude (15 mag) but different distances.

I think the key here is understanding the relationship between a star's apparent brightness (as seen from Earth) and its distance. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. 

Wait, no, the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d) + 5. So m = M + 5 log10(d) + 5. That makes sense because closer stars have lower apparent magnitudes (brighter).

The ESPRESSO spectrograph's performance depends on how much light it can collect. The S/N ratio is higher for brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude) because they emit more photons. So the closer the star, the brighter it appears, the higher the S/N.

But what is the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve for a star of a certain magnitude in an hour? I think I need to know the limiting magnitude for a S/N of 10 per pixel for a 1-hour exposure.

Alternatively, I might have to calculate the exposure time needed to reach S/N 10 for each star. But I don't have the exact numbers, so maybe I should think about the factors that affect S/N.

S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, and inversely proportional to the noise, which relates to the dark current and readout noise, but assuming those are constant for a given instrument setup, S/N scales with the signal, which depends on the number of photons collected.

The signal is higher for brighter stars (lower magnitudes) because more photons reach the detector per unit time.

So for each option, I'll calculate the apparent magnitude and then determine if under 1 hour exposure, the S/N per binned pixel is at least 10.

Wait, but I don't know the exact S/N per mag. Maybe I can recall that the VLT has a certain light-collecting power. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but for S/N, the total photon count matters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the formula for S/N: S/N = (flux) * sqrt(t) / noise. But without specific noise values, I
