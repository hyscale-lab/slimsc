Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially with cylindrical symmetry, it's often useful to switch to polar coordinates. Because the particle is moving in two dimensions, r and θ are the natural choices. So the potential here is a function of r and theta.

Let me think about the potential structure. The first term is (1/2)kr². That looks familiar—it's similar to the potential in a harmonic oscillator. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, so the potential has both a radial part and an angular part. Wait, but the radial part is multiplied by cos squared theta. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can separate the potential into radial and angular components. Let me see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So, I can factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, but is that helpful? Alternatively, perhaps I can consider it as a sum of terms, but I'm not sure. Maybe the potential can be rewritten in a way that reveals it's a product of functions in r and theta, which would allow for separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider whether this potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or other operators. Wait, cos²θ can be written in terms of cos(2θ), maybe? Because I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So let's substitute that in.

So, replacing cos²θ with (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Then the second term becomes (3/2)k r² [ (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ] = (3k r²)/4 (1 + cos(2θ)). So now the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3k r²)/4 (1 + cos(2θ)).

Let me compute
