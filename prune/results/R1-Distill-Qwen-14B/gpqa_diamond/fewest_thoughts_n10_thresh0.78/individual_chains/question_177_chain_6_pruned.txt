Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The astronomers are comparing them, and we need to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. 

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about stellar luminosity. Oh right, the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, this formula should apply to both.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, but wait, mass might not directly affect luminosity here unless we're considering something like the star's life cycle or other mass-related properties. But maybe the question is focusing on radius and temperature, so I'll set that aside for now.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength! I remember Wien's Law, which says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same too. Because λ_max is the same for both stars, T1 = T2. 

Wait, but wait a second. If their temperatures are the same, then the only thing affecting luminosity is the radius. Because L is proportional to R² T^4. Since T is the same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. R1 is 1.5 R2, so L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. That would make the luminosity ratio 2.25 times. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, is that the whole story?

Wait, but wait again. The problem also mentions that the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity... How does that come into play? Oh, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So for Star_2, which is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength would be Doppler shifted.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So before any Doppler shifting, their rest wavelengths (based on temperature) are the same? Or is the observed wavelength after Doppler shift the same?

Hmm. Let's think. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed λ would be shorter than its rest λ. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So
