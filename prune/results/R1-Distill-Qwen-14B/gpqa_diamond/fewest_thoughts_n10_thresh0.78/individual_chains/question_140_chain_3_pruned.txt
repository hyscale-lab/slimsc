Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, so I guess that means it's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Wait, but in a molecule, each atom contributes. Oh wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm.

Then, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. I remember that water's melting point is 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is a bit higher, around 4°C maybe. So B might be something like ice or another compound that melts near that temperature. Or maybe another solid that's close to that.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, I'm not sure about that part yet.

X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, X is similar to another reagent, so maybe it's something like a common reagent like NaOH or KOH because those are strong bases and are often used in organic reactions.

Wait, the substance X reacts with a keto acid. Keto acids are like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When they react with bases, they might form enolates. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Let me think about the reactions. X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce gas W, precipitate G. So maybe it's a double displacement reaction. If X is a metal hydroxide, Y could be an acid. Or perhaps X is an alkali metal, like sodium or potassium.

Wait, when something reacts violently with a liquid to produce gas and precipitate... Maybe it's a carbonate reacting with acid? Or perhaps a metal reacting with an acid. But then what would produce a precipitate? Maybe it's a reaction between a metal and an acid to form a salt and hydrogen gas. But then, the gas would be H2, which has two atoms. But the question says the gas W has a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons.

Wait, H2 is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2's molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons—so no, that's not equal. Hmm. So what else could it be?

Another possibility is CO2 gas. But CO2 has 22 neutrons in total (12 from C, 16 from each O, but wait, per molecule: C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So in CO2, the total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 (since C is C-12 usually, 6 neutrons) + 8*2 (each O has 8 neutrons? Wait, O is typically O-16, which has 8 neutrons, so two O's would be 16. So total neutrons: 6 + 16 = 22. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that's a possible candidate for gas W.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction would produce CO2 gas. But wait, what if that's not the case? Are there other possibilities?

Wait, another gas with equal protons and neutrons. Let's think of another molecule. Maybe CO? But CO has 7 protons (
