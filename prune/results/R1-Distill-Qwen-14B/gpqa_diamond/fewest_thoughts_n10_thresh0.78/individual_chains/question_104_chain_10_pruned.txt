Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about their orbital periods based on the shifts in their spectral lines detected via the RV method.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star move. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I vaguely recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(2/3) )) ) )

Wait, but since both planets are around stars of the same mass (like Sun) and the planet masses are similar (Neptune), maybe M_p is the same for both. Also, the orbits are circular, so e=0, so that term goes away.

So simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, let me think again. The exact formula I think is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star (Neptune is way less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And e=0, so denominator's 1. So K simplifies to something like (constant) * (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact relation. Oh wait, I can't look stuff up, but I can remember that K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ). Wait, no, that might not be exactly right.

Alternatively, I recall that the semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 day in seconds))^(1/3) )) / (2 pi c) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the RV method.
