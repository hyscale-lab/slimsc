Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest-masses. The combined rest-mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the two fragments as fragment A and fragment B. Let’s say fragment A is the more massive one, so A is twice as heavy as B. So, mass of A is 2m, mass of B is m. Wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So 2m + m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So, the masses of A and B are 0.66 M and 0.33 M respectively.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. Initially, the rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the initial rest energy is Mc² = 300 GeV. Right.

When the nucleus fissions, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. The problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, so the mass defect is 1% of M. So, the total energy released should be the rest energy of the initial nucleus minus the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments.

So, initial energy is 300 GeV. The rest mass energies of the fragments are (0.66 M)c² and (0.33 M)c². So, 0.99 M c² is their combined rest mass. So the energy released is 300 GeV - (
