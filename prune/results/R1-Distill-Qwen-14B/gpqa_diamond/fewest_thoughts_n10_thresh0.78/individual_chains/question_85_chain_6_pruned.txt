Okay, I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - a)/(epsilon) )^(1/2), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe it's something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) ?

Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) / ( Bond albedo ) )? No, perhaps the bond albedo is the same for both planets here since the problem states both have the same albedo. So albedo cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, the formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/2), where A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same A, when taking the ratio, A will cancel out.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(2a1)) / (R_s/(2a2)) ) ) ) * sqrt( (1 - A)/(1 - A) ) ) 

Which simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because the R_s and (1 - A) terms cancel. So the ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes, but wait, actually, because if T_eq is proportional to (R_star / a)^(1/2), then T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Hmm, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( (R_star)/(2a) ) * ... So T1 over T2 is sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a1 ), which is sqrt( (a2/a1) ). But I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances.

But how do I get a1 and a
