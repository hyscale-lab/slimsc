Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200°C without air, which probably means it's in an inert atmosphere or under conditions where decomposition occurs without oxygen. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three different tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper.

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g of CuO, and the second tube's weight doesn't change. Finally, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left under standard temperature and pressure (STP).

I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are numbers like 13, 15, etc.

Hmm. Let's think about what each of these tubes does.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So if tube 1 gains mass, it means water vapor was present in the gas mixture. The increase in mass is 3.60g, so that's probably the mass of the water vapor captured.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, which suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. So the gases didn't have any CO2, meaning any CO2 produced must have reacted elsewhere or wasn't formed.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper is used to react with certain gases. Since CuO is formed, the gas that reacted must be something like H2S or maybe SO2, but wait, if it's a gas that can react with copper, like H2S, then it would produce S and CuO. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with something else, like CO, but CO doesn't react with copper. Wait, maybe it's reacting with O2 or another gas. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S. Because when H2S passes through hot copper, it can react to form S and CuO.

Wait, but wait: when H2S passes over red-hot copper, the reaction is 2 H2S + Cu → CuS + 2 H2. Hmm, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's reacting with O2? No, because O2 would not produce CuO on its own. Maybe the gas is SO2, but SO2 would react with copper at high temperatures, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2. Because H2 can react with copper oxide, but in this case, the copper is red-hot, so maybe H2 is being oxidized. Let's think. If the gas is H2, when it passes over red-hot copper, it doesn't react. Wait, no, because H2 is a reducing agent. So if
