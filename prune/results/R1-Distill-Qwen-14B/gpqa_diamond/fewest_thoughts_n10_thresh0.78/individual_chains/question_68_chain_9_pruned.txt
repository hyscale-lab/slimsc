Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again. Hmm, there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another field along +Y is turned on, same magnitude B. I need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, spin-1/2 particles... I remember that their spin states can be up or down, and when a magnetic field is applied, the energy levels split. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. Oh wait, in this case, mu is given as gamma times Sz. So the magnetic moment is along the z-direction.

Initially, the field is along +Z. So the particle's spin will align with that, right? So the state is either spin-up or spin-down along Z. But when the magnetic field is turned off, wait, what happens then? Oh, no, the second field is turned on along +Y. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, and then the system is subjected to a magnetic field in the Y direction.

Wait, the magnetic moment feels a torque in the direction of the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. But since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, that would make H = -gamma Sz * B_y direction?

Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So the magnetic moment vector is along the z-axis. When the magnetic field is along Y, the torque would cause the spin to precess around Y. But since the particle's magnetic moment is along Z, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B = -gamma S_z * B_y. Wait, no, because B_y is along the y-axis, so mu is along z, so their dot product is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Oh no, wait, maybe I got the setup wrong.

Wait, the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin. So the actual vector is mu = gamma * (Sx, Sy, Sz). So in that case, when the magnetic field is applied in the Y direction, the interaction energy is H = -mu · B, which would be H = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) = -gamma B Sy. So H is proportional to Sy.

Wait, let me think again. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So the vector mu has components (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz), because S is a vector operator. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy is H = - mu · B. Since B is along Y, so B = (0, B, 0). So H = -gamma (S_x *0 + S_y * B + S_z *0) = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_y. But wait, perhaps I should write it as H = - gamma B S_y. Or is it positive? Wait, the energy is H = -mu · B, so yes, it's negative. So H is proportional to -gamma B S_y.

But S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But the important thing is that the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z.

The initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, which is along the original magnetic field. So the initial state is either |+z> or |−z>. Let's say it's |+z> just for discussion.

When the Hamiltonian is switched on (B turned on along Y), the state will evolve under H. Since H is proportional to S_y, which doesn't commute with S_z, the state will start to precess around the Y-axis.

The time evolution of the state is given by the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ). Let me compute H. H = - gamma B S_y. So H = - gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y, because S_y = ħ/2 sigma_y (sigma_y is the Pauli matrix).

So H = (- gamma B ħ / 2 ) sigma_y. The energy eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H are E_± = ± (- gamma B ħ / 2 ) * (1/2)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H would have eigenvalues E_± = -gamma B (± ħ/2) = ∓ gamma B ħ /2.

Wait, but in terms of the spin matrices, sigma_y has eigenvalues ±1, so H would have eigenvalues E = - gamma B (ħ/2) * eigenvalue. So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2) * (1) = - gamma B ħ / 2, and E_- = + gamma B ħ / 2. Hmm, no, wait: Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, so H = - gamma B (S_y) = - gamma B (ħ/2 sigma_y). So the eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2)(1) = - gamma B ħ / 2, E_- = + gamma B ħ / 2.

Wait, but the time evolution is determined by the energy differences. The state |+z> is not an eigenstate of H, so it'll evolve into a superposition of energy eigenstates.

The energy difference between the two states is E_+ - E_- = (-gamma B ħ/2
