Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, proportional, so I guess I'll need to normalize it. Oh right, because the probabilities have to add up to 1. So first, I should find the normalization factor.

The states |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So the state |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of these two. Let me denote the coefficients as a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). So the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>.

The first step is to normalize |alpha>. The norm is the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, summed. So |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's calculate that.

|a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. Because (1+i) times (1-i) is 1 - i + i - i², and i² is -1, so 1 +1 =2.

Wait, actually, wait. The magnitude squared of a complex number z = x + iy is x² + y². So for a = 1 + i, |a|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, for b = 2 - i, |b|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So now, the problem asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what's the size of the matrix? Since it's a spin-½ system, the space is two-dimensional, so the matrix is 2x2.

So the matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Because A_12 = ħ/2 and A_21 = ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, interesting. I think this operator is similar to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
