Okay, so I have a physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. I'm supposed to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the question is about relative motion and how time and distance transform between different inertial frames. Oh right, because when you have two objects moving relative to each other, their measurements of time and distance can differ due to special relativity, but wait, what's the speed here? 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate that speed in terms of c.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times c, right? 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2. So that's 20% the speed of light. That's a substantial fraction, so relativistic effects might be important here.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about acceleration or the like, so perhaps we can treat this as a simple velocity addition problem. Or maybe it's about time dilation because of the relative motion between the frames.

Wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So let me clarify: the time given is in the ejecta's frame, and I need to find how much distance the ejecta covers in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me re-read the question. It says, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

Wait, that wording is a bit tricky. So from the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. What is the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame? Or, perhaps, what is the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, perhaps we need to find the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta experiences 50 seconds. Or wait, maybe I should think about how time intervals transform between frames.

So, the key here is to use the time dilation formula from special relativity. Because if two inertial frames are moving relative to each other, the time intervals between events (like the passage of 50 seconds) will be different in each frame.

So, the time dilation formula is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/cÂ²), but in this case, since the events are the same in both frames (the start and end of the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame), perhaps the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to the relative motion.

Wait, wait, no, let me think again.
