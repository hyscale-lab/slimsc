Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Okay, let's see what the question is about.

Hmm, so the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe it's just a method for detecting planets. Anyway, the planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P.

The question is asking about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that should simplify things because albedo affects the temperature, but if it's the same, maybe that part cancels out.

Equilibrium temperature, I remember, depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, another thought. Or maybe the formula is T = T_star * (Luminosity factor)^(1/4) * (distance factor). Or maybe it's more about the inverse square law for flux and then taking the fourth root for temperature. 

Wait, I think the basic formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / ( (1 AU)^2 * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) )^(1/2) ). But wait, that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of it more simply. 

Oh, right! The equilibrium temperature is given by the formula: T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is the albedo. Wait, no, another approach. Actually, the effective temperature formula is T = T_star * ( L / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4) ), but that's when you're comparing it to Earth's conditions. Or perhaps
