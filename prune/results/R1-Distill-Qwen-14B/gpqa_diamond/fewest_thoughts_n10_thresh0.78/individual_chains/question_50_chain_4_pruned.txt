Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the superficial degree of divergence, which in turn is connected to the scaling of the amplitude with energy scales.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, usually denoted as Î±. G would be a coupling constant, perhaps for a force like the strong force. The term (Q/M) is the ratio of some energy scale Q to another scale M.

In loop calculations, each loop typically contributes a factor of some energy scale raised to a certain power, and a logarithm might come in, but perhaps in this case, we're looking for the power of (Q/M). The degree of divergence is often linked to the number of loops because each loop can introduce a certain number of integrations, affecting the scaling.

Wait, I think the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - L*(E - V), or something like that. Or wait, another formula: D = 4 - L*(E - V), where E is the number of external lines, V the vertices, and L the loops. But maybe I'm confusing that with another formula.

Alternatively, the scaling with the energy Q is often used to find the number of loops. For example, a tree-level diagram (no loops) would have a certain scaling, but each loop can add a factor like log(Q/M) or a power of Q/M.

Wait, but the term here is (Q/M)^2. So maybe each loop contributes a certain power. Let me think about how loop integrals scale.

In a Feynman diagram, each loop integral typically introduces a factor proportional to (Lambda)^something. But in dimensional regularization or other regularization schemes, the exact form can vary, but often you get terms like (Q^2/M^2)^{L}, where L is the number of loops.

Alternatively, for each loop, you might get a factor that contributes a certain power. For example, a one-loop diagram might contribute (Q^2/M^2)^{1/2}, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the overall scaling of the amplitude.

The expression has (Q/M)^2. Suppose each loop contributes a factor of (Q/M)^n, and the total is squared. So if each loop contributes (Q/M)^1, then two loops would give (Q/M)^2. But wait, maybe not exactly.

Alternatively, consider the general scaling. For a loop integral in four dimensions, the integral typically scales as (Q^2)^{L}, where L is the number of loops. Each loop adds a dimension of energy, so the amplitude would have a certain power of Q.

In the given expression, the (Q/M)^2 term suggests that the amplitude scales as (Q/M)^2. So if each loop contributes a factor of Q, then two loops would give Q^2, but here it's (Q/M)^2, which suggests two loops and each contributes a factor of (Q/M).

Wait, no, perhaps the loop integrals contribute factors of (Q^2)^{L/2} or something similar. Let's think about the superficial degree of divergence. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4L - 2I + V, but I'm not too confident. Alternatively, it's D = 4 - (E - V), where E is the number of external lines and V the number of vertices. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of dimensional analysis.

The expression includes alpha^3, which is a dimensionless quantity. g^2 is also dimensionless. The 8 and sqrt(2) are just constants. 1/(4pi)^6 is also dimensionless, since 4pi has units of energy (if pi is dimensionless). The (Q/M) term is a
