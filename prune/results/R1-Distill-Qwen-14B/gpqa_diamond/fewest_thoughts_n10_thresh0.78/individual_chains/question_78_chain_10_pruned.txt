Alright, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Okay, let me think step by step.

So, the question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t. The charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a time t where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. 

I remember that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential is associated with the electric field, while the vector potential contributes to both electric and magnetic fields. Oh wait, but the potentials themselves are influenced by the motion of the charge.

Wait, the options are given with various expressions. Let me recall the formulas. The scalar potential due to a charge is usually given by Coulomb's law, right? So V is something like q/(4πε0 r), but I think when the charge is moving, there might be some relativistic effects or terms involving velocity. Hmm.

I think the scalar potential V for a moving charge is similar to the static case but with some correction terms. Or wait, maybe it's calculated using the retarded time. Oh right, because the fields are retarded—the effect at time t is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, such that the light travel time from tr to t is considered.

So the scalar potential V(r, t) for a charge moving with velocity v at time tr would involve the potential at the retarded position. The standard expression I remember is something like V = q/(4πε0) [ 1/( |r - d| ) ], where d is the displacement vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the scalar potential is given by (q/(4πε0)) times 1 over the distance at the retarded time. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the general form for V when the charge is moving is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * (1/|r - r’|), where r’ is the position of the charge at the retarded time tr. But in this problem, they've defined d as the vector from the field generating point (r
