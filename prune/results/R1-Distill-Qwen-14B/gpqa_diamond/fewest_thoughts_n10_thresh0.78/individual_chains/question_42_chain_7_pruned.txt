Okay, let's see. I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. The question is about finding the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. Hmm.

So, the given data includes the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the ratio of their masses. Also, all have the same albedo, which is 0.3, like Earth's. The key here is probably the TTV method, but I'm not too sure about the specifics. I remember TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, which is a method used to detect exoplanets by looking at the variations in their transits. But how does that tie into the problem? Maybe not directly needed here.

I think the main point is about the equilibrium temperature and how it relates to the orbital period. Wait, equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance between the planet and the star.

But wait, the problem gives the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures between the planets. So for Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio is 1.4, and for Planet2 and Planet3, 2.3. That means T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So I can find T1/T3 by multiplying these ratios, right? 1.4 * 2.3. Let me calculate that. 1.4 * 2 is 2.8, 1.4 * 0.3 is 0.42, so together it's 3.22. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3. But wait, I'm looking for the periods, so I need to relate temperature to orbital period.

The orbital period is governed by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (assuming the mass of the
