Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my substitution and electrophilic reactions, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, which has a ketone group on a two-carbon chain. The substituent is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. On that phenyl ring, there are two substituents: a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering the positions would have the bromo at position 3 and nitro at 5. But wait, let me visualize that. If the substituents are para to each other, or meta?

Wait, phenyl groups attached to ketones are typically meta directors because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. So, when we have substituents on the benzene ring, their positions will depend on the directing effects of the groups present at each substitution step.

Let me outline the target structure:

The benzene ring has a substituent at positions 3 and 5. Let's imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group (from acetone) attached. Wait, no. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one), so when it's attached to a benzene, it's like a benzyl ketone. So, the structure is benzene with a -COCH3 group attached. So the benzene is connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a methyl group. So, the benzene is at position 1, the ketone is at position 1 of the acetone. Then on the benzene ring, we have substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other, considering the ketone is at the para position relative to one of them?

Wait, maybe it's better to sketch it mentally. Let's say the benzene ring has the ketone group (COCH3) attached at position 1. Then, the substituents are at 3 and 5. So, positions 3 and 5 are both meta to each other relative to position 1. So, that would put the nitro group at position 5 and bromine at 3, or vice versa.

Wait, but the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, so that's two meta positions from each other relative to the ketone.

So, the synthesis requires introducing a ketone group, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So, the plan is to introduce substituents in the right order. The order of introducing substituents matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

I remember that activating groups like -NH2 are strong
