Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, and the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, but in parsecs or something. So distance r would be 1/plx. That makes sense because as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in. So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so taking reciprocal gives r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. That's the number of stars in the entire region, but the question is about the number per unit range of distance. Oh right, so it's not just the total but how it increases as you go to larger distances. So if N is proportional to r^5, then for a small change in r, like dr, how does the number change? Oh right, maybe we need to think about the derivative. Because the question is about the change per unit distance
