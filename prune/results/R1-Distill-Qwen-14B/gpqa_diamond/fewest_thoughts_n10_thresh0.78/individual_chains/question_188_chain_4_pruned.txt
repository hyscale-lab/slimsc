Okay, I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The given data is that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, wait, interatomic distance. Hmm, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a cube that's been skewed in all directions, right? So the lattice is a rhombohedron, and all edges are equal, but angles are not 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

So, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h² + k² + l²) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ - 1)/3 )

Wait, wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Another approach is to use the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal lattice.

I remember the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, for a cubic system, it's simpler because the angles are 90 degrees, but here it's a rhombohedral system where all angles are equal but not 90. So the formula must account for the angles.

Wait, I think the general formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles α, β, γ is:

d^2 = (a^2 h^2 + b^2 k^2 + c^2 l^2) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) ) - 2 (h k cos γ + k l cos α + l h cos β) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c. Let's denote them all as
