Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2, both equal to 1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So that's |l1, l2, l, m>, where l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component.

Wait, but wait a second. The total angular momentum state is the combination of the two individual angular momenta. So when you couple two l=1 particles, the possible total L values can be L=2, 1, 0. Because the addition of two angular momenta goes from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2| in integer steps. So 1+1=2, 1-1=0, so possible L values are 2, 1, 0. But in this state, the total L is 2 and M is -1. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. So each L1z and L2z is the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum. The possible eigenvalues are m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron since l=1.

We need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but the given state is |1,1,2,-1>. How does that relate to the product states of the individual electrons' states? Hmm, I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product of individual states.

The coupled angular momentum states are usually expressed using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1, l2, L, M> can be written as a linear combination of |m1> |m2> states, where m1 + m2 = M. But in this case
