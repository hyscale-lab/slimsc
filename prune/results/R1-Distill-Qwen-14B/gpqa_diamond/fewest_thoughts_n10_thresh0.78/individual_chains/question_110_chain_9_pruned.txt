Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with various properties. Each star has RA (right ascension), DEC (declination), V magnitude, distance, and sometimes E(B-V), which is the color excess. The observatories have different brightness limits for stars they can observe. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can see brighter than 16 V mag. So the idea is to find which stars are bright enough (i.e., have an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES) to be detected by both instruments.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter means smaller magnitude numbers, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag ≤ 17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag ≤16.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait. Let me clarify. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So if a star's apparent V is brighter (i.e., magnitude less than 17), it can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag can be observed. So, for both, the star must have apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no. Wait, no. Because "brighter than" 17 means magnitude is less than 17. But the observable range for ESPRESSO is up to 17 mag and brighter (so, apparent V ≤17), and HIRES is up to 16 mag and brighter. So a star must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES to be
