Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read through it again and see what it's about. 

Alright, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They've done some experiments with knockout mutants and double mutants. So, the setup is that they've identified three genes, G1, G2, G3. They knocked out each gene, making mutants g1, g2, g3, and also created double mutants where two genes are knocked out: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3.

The key is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters. That would mean if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes might not be expressed, affecting the phenotype.

The experiment measured the resistance to anthracnose in each mutant and double mutant. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. Here are the results:

- g1: 75% (so, less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (less resistant, but not completely)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% 
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. Now, I need to figure out the gene interactions based on these results. The options are A to D, each giving a different conclusion. 

Let me think about what these results mean. First, if a single mutant is highly susceptible, that suggests that gene is critical. For instance, g2 has 0% resistance, which is the same as the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3). So, what's happening here?

I remember that in genetics, epistasis refers to the interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if a gene is epistatic to another, it means that its phenotype masks or modifies the phenotype of another gene.

In this context, let's map out the data. 

Looking at the single mutants:
- g2 is completely susceptible: 0%. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests G2 is a critical gene, maybe the transcription factor since it's completely knocked out. 

Wait, but the question says at least one is a transcription factor upstream. So if G2 is the TF, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of the genes it controls. So, if G2 is a TF, then the downstream genes (maybe G1 or G3) would not be expressed, leading to a loss of resistance.

Wait, but let's see the double mutants. For example, the double mutant g1g2 has 0% resistance. That's the same as g2 alone. So, in the double mutant, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But since the resistance is 0%, same as g2, that suggests that knocking out G1 doesn't change the resistance beyond what G2 knockout already does. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2? Because if G2 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent G1 from being expressed, making g1's effect redundant or not showing any additional effect.

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%. So, in the wild type, 100% resistance. When G1 is knocked out, it's 75%. So, G1 contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. Because without G2, resistance drops to 0%, but without G1, it's only 75%. 

So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and/or G3. Let's look at g3: it's 50% resistance. So, without G3, the plant has half resistance. 

Now, the double mutants: 

g1g3 is 10% - that's even worse than either single mutant. So, the combined effect is much more severe.

g1g2 is 0%: same as g2.

g2g3 is 0%: same as g2.

Hmm. So, when you knock out G2 in combination with any other gene, the resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because in the presence of a G2 knockout, the other gene's status doesn't matter; the resistance is as bad as G2 knockout alone.

Wait, but what's the definition of epistasis here. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, that means the phenotype of gene B is only visible when gene A is functional. So, in this case, when G2 is knocked out, the phenotype is 0%, regardless of whether other genes are knocked out. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, G2 is acting upstream, perhaps as a transcription factor. Because
