Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The question is about an electron moving at a certain speed and the uncertainty in its energy. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the electron is traveling along the x-direction at speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. But I'm being asked about energy uncertainty, not momentum. Oh right, energy and momentum are related, so maybe I can find ΔE by considering the uncertainty in momentum.

Momentum p is mass times velocity, right? So p = m*v. But since we have an uncertainty in p, Δp, the uncertainty in momentum would be m times the uncertainty in velocity, Δv. Alternatively, if we have Δp from the position uncertainty, maybe we can relate that to the energy.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum. So, if we have an uncertainty in p, we can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

First, let's tackle the uncertainty in momentum. Using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But wait, the question is about the minimum uncertainty, so I can take the equality: Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

What's the value of ħ? I think it's approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But sometimes, for rough estimates, people use 10^-34 J·s as ħ.

So plugging in the numbers: Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 meters.

So Δp = (1e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) = (1e-34)/(2e-10) kg·m/s. Let's compute that:
