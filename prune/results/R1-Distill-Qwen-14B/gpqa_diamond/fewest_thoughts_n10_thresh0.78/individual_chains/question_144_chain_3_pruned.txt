Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like decay length = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

But first, I think I need to find the lifetime τ. The mean lifetime is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For the particle's lifetime, ΔE is the energy width Γ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But wait, I should double-check that. Oh right, the relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I also recall that the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have τ, then I need to find βγ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Wait, no, I think the formula is
