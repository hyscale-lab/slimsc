Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They give the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex is Ca-EDTA^2-, right? So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. But wait, the formation constant, K, is given. I think the formation constant (Kf) is for the formation of the complex from the ions.

Oh right, the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. That suggests that initially, all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. So, the total concentration of EDTA species is 0.02 M, assuming that the initial EDTA is all in the form of the complex.

Wait, but when the complex dissociates, it can release Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. I need to find [Ca^2+]. Since K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca^2+] should be very small.

Let me set this up. Let's say the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the change as x. So, when some of the complex dissociates, it produces x of Ca^2+ and x of EDTA^4-. So:

At equilibrium:
 [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
 [Ca^2+] = x
 [EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. The EDTA in solution could be in different forms. Oh but the problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, so the alpha fraction for Y^4- is 1. But I might not need to worry about that because the problem says to assume pH is ideal, so maybe it's already taken into account in the K value.

So then the Kf is given as 5e10. So plugging into the equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x)

So 5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12

Then x = sqrt(2e-12) = approx 4.47e-6 M. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options don't have that. Let me check my approach again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let's think again. The complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. So, if the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, it's 0.02 - x. But since x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 5e10. But wait, wait! No, wait. Oh right, I think I had the K equation backwards. The formation constant is defined as Kf = [complex]/([M][L]). So in this case, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4
