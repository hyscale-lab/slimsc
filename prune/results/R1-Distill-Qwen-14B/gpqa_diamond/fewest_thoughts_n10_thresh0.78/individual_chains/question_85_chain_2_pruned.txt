Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that it's calculated based on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 / (sqrt(epsilon)), but wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms. Oh no, wait, maybe it's T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25, where A is the albedo.

But wait, the star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So maybe I should express the planet's equilibrium temperature in terms of the star's Teff, radius, and the planet's distance a.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so when taking the ratio, A would cancel out.

So the ratio T1/T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

Wait, because sqrt(R
