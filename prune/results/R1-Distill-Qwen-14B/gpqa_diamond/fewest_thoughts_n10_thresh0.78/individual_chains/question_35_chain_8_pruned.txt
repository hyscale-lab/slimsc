Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S. Oh right, c is given as h/(4π), and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then check which of the statements (A to D) is correct.

Wait, okay, first step: let me write down the matrix S. So, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And A_y is c multiplied by this S matrix. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix like this, which resembles a Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, right? Oh wait, S looks like sigma_y. Let me confirm: sigma_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Yes, so S is sigma_y. So A_y is c multiplied by sigma_y.

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±i. Because sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but wait, no, wait: sigma matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by something. Wait no, the Pauli matrices have trace zero and determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are +1 and -1? Or wait, no, wait, no: the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. But wait, A_y is c times sigma_y, so let's calculate that.

So the eigenvalues of A_y would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S (which is sigma_y). The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±i. Wait, wait, no, because sigma matrices are Hermitian? No, wait, sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z are Hermitian? Wait, no, sigma matrices are Hermitian. Because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. Wait, but wait, sigma_y is Hermitian? Let me check:

The matrix S is:
[ 0 -i ]
[ i  0 ]

The conjugate transpose would be:
[ 0  i ]
[ -i 0 ]

Which is the same as S, so yes, S is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues must be real. Wait, but earlier I thought sigma_y's eigenvalues are ±i. That can't be right, because then they'd be imaginary, but S is Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be real. Hmm, did I mix something up.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So sigma_y should have real eigenvalues. But when I tried to find eigenvalues before, I thought they were ±i. That must be wrong. Let's compute the eigenvalues of S (sigma_y) correctly.

The matrix S is:
0   -i
i    0

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is:
(0 - λ)(0 - λ) - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

Compute (-i)(i). i times i is i² = -1, but with two negatives: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant equation becomes λ² - 1 = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Oh wait, so the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. That makes sense because it's a Hermitian matrix. So then A_y has eigenvalues c * λ, where λ is ±1. So since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of A_y are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) *
