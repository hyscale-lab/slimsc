Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy is given in terms of E, where E is (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Hmm. So I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n² E), where n is the quantum number. Because E is already given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy for n=1.

But wait, here we have four identical particles. Since they are spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering spin.

Wait, but wait—since we're in a 1D box, each particle has quantum number n, and for spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with the same n but different spins.

So for each level n, maximum two particles can be placed. So for four particles, I'll have to fill up the levels according to the exclusion principle.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since spatial and spin parts combine, perhaps the spatial part could be symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric and vice versa. But maybe I should think about how the particles fill up the energy levels.

Let me think about the filling order. The ground state would have the lowest possible energies, then the first excited, etc.

In a 1D box, the energy levels are E_n for each particle, and each level can hold a maximum of two particles (since spin up and down). So for four particles, how do they fill the lowest energy levels?

Ground state: The lowest energy is n=1. Since two particles can be here (each with spin up and down). So two particles
