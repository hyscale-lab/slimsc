Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: There's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has 2.5 Earth radii, that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits. The options are A to D, which are different periods.

Hmm, transits and occultations. Right, a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and an occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, becoming hidden by it. But wait, for both events to occur, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it can both transit and occult relative to the first planet.

Wait, but wait. The first planet is the one with Earth's radius. The second is 2.5 Earth radii. But I'm not sure if the sizes matter here. Let me think about the orbital periods.

I remember that in a system with multiple planets, for them to transit each other, their orbital periods need to be in a certain ratio. Oh, right, the condition for a planet to both transit and occult another is that their orbital periods should be in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if they have exactly the same period and radius, they'd orbit exactly in the same path, so they would always be in the same position relative to each other. But that's probably not the case here.

Wait, the problem is about a planet that can transit and occult the first planet. Oh, wait no, no. Wait, no: the question says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, perhaps the second planet transits the star (we see it in front) and the first planet (smaller) transits the second planet? No, that doesn't make much sense. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, during a transit, the planet moves in front of the star. For an occultation, the planet is behind the star. But what would cause a planet to occult another? Maybe if the second planet is larger, so when the
