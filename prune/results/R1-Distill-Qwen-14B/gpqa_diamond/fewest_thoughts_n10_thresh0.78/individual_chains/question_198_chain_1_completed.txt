Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, okay. Let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The given data includes concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and stability constants for different complexes.

Wait, stability constants, right. Stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So the complexes with higher β will dominate.

The problem says that the solution has Co^2+ and SCN^- ions. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2-? Or maybe something else. Because each β corresponds to a different n, the number of SCN- ligands attached.

I think the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+ but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, cobalt can have different oxidation states, but here it's Co(II). So Co^2+ complexes with SCN^-.

So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(something), etc. Wait, wait. Let's get the charges right. Cobalt(II) is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So for each complex:

n SCN- would contribute -n. So the overall charge would be Co^2+ + n*(-1) = 2 - n.

But maybe the complexes are neutral or something else. Wait, perhaps the complexes are neutral, but I'm not certain. Oh wait, maybe the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). Let me think about the stability constants. The β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β corresponds to a different complex, probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.

Wait, for the first complex, n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+.

Because Co^2+ has charge +2, and one SCN^- (charge -1). So 2 -1 = +1. So the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, and the β1 is 9.

Similarly, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because 2 - 2 = 0. So that's neutral. β2 is 40.

n=3 would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-2? Because 2 -3 = -1 per SCN? Wait, no, SCN is -1 each. So three of them would be -3. So Co^2+ + 3*(-1) = -1. So the complex charge would be -1? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the charges. The key is that the stability constants are in a sequence. The problem is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the one with two SCN^- ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(0?), because 2+ and 2*(-1) = 0.

The question asks for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, the one with two SCN ligands, so n=2. So we need to find the fraction of this species relative to all possible Co species.

The approach here is to calculate the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all species: free Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

Wait, but the given β values are for four complexes. Let's list them:

- β1 (n=1): 9
- β2 (n=2):40
- β3 (n=3):63
- β4 (n=4):16

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3. So the most stable complex is n=3, followed by n=2, then n=1, and n=4 is the least.

Wait, but I thought higher β means more stable. So β3 is the highest, so [Co(SCN)_3]^-1 is the most stable. But the question is about [Co(SCN)_2], which would be β2=40.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2], we need to calculate the fraction of each species and sum them.

The general approach for such problems is to use the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stability constants, but dealing with all possible species can get complicated. Alternatively, a common approach is to use the formation of each complex in sequence, and calculate the relative concentrations.

Another approach is to model the system using the equilibrium expressions. The concentration of each complex can be determined by the product of the free ion concentrations and the stability constant, divided by the product of the previous complex's β and the dissociation step.

Wait, but considering all four complexes, each formed by adding SCN- step by step. The free Co^2+ is [Co^2+], the first complex is [CoSCN]^+ with concentration [CoSCN]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-], the second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 / [CoSCN]^+? Or perhaps a better way is to model each complex's concentration in terms of the previous.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the distribution using the stepwise formation constants. But perhaps a simpler approach is to use the following:

The fraction of each complex is given by f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^(n) ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + ... up to n terms )

Wait, no, because each β is the cumulative stability constant. So for the nth complex, the stability constant is βn = β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Hmm, wait no. Wait, the stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise formation constants. But in this problem, each β is given as the cumulative constant. Or are they stepwise?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Stability constants can be presented as cumulative or stepwise. In this problem, it's probably given as the cumulative β. Let me clarify.

The cumulative stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise constants for each addition of SCN^-.

For example, β1 is the constant for [CoSCN]^+ = K1 (stepwise), β2 is K1*K2 (cumulative for n=2), β3 is K1*K2*K3, etc.

Wait, but in the problem statement, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is higher than β2, which is higher than β1, but β4 is lower. So that might not make sense if they are cumulative, because each step adds more, so βn should be higher than βn-1. But here, β4 is lower than β3. So that suggests that perhaps the given β's are stepwise constants for each addition.

Wait, wait. Maybe each β is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ligand. So β1 is K1 = [CoSCN^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9. β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^0]/([CoSCN^+][SCN^-])=40. Similarly, β3= [Co(SCN)_3^-]/([Co(SCN)_2^0][SCN^-])=63. And β4= [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co(SCN)_3^-][SCN^-])=16.

In this case, the overall (cumulative) stability constants would be:

β_total for n=1: 9

n=2: 9*40=360

n=3: 9*40*63=22680

n=4:9*40*63*16 = 362880?

Wait, but that would make the n=4 complex the most stable, which is not the case as β4 (stepwise) is lower. Hmm, perhaps the given β's are the cumulative stability constants for each complex. Wait, but that would mean their product increases with n, except for n=4.

Wait, the given β's are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. If they are cumulative, then β3=63 is higher than β2=40, which is higher than β1=9, but β4=16 is lower. That doesn't make sense because each step adds another ligand, so the cumulative β should increase. So perhaps the given β's are the stepwise constants, not cumulative. Or perhaps the numbering is off.

Alternatively, maybe the given β's are the overall (cumulative) stability constants, but the problem arises for n=4. Because β4=16, which is lower than β3=63. That would imply that adding the fourth ligand is less favorable, which is possible. So the complex [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has a lower stability than [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But regardless, the approach is to calculate the fractions of each species.

Let me consider that each β is the cumulative stability constant. So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but that can't be, because the denominator for each step would involve the previous complex.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model each complex as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n / (product of [Co(SCN)_k] for k < n} )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, each [Co(SCN)_n] can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ and the free SCN^-.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free Co^2+.

The idea is to compute the fraction of each complex as:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, that would be the case if βn is the product of the stepwise constants. Because each complex's concentration is proportional to β1*β2*...*βn [SCN^-]^n.

But given that the β's are presented as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, perhaps each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So the cumulative β for each complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but in that case, let me compute the cumulative β for each n:

n=1: β1 =9

n=2: β1*β2=9*40=360

n=3: 9*40*63=22680

n=4: 9*40*63*16= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

Wait, that would mean the cumulative β increases with each n. So the highest is n=4, which is 362880. But that's not possible because in reality, the stability constants usually peak at some n and then decrease, but not necessarily. So perhaps the given β's are the stepwise constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the log β values? No, the values are 9, 40, etc., which are too big for log.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the overall (cumulative) stability constants, but the problem is that β4=16 is lower than β3=63. That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible.

So, given that, the fraction of each species would be:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum for k=0 to 4 of βk [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, βk is the cumulative stability constant for complex k. So for [Co^2+] (k=0), it's just 1 (since [Co^2+] = [Co^2+], no complex). For k=1, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] =9* [Co^2+][SCN-]. But wait, no, because β1 is the cumulative constant, [Co(SCN)]^+ * [H+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = β1, so [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-].

But to find the fraction of each species, we can write:

The fraction of each species is the quantity (βn [SCN^-]^n) divided by the sum of all (βk [SCN^-]^k) for k=0 to 4.

Wait, but β0 is 1 (since [Co^2+] = β0 [Co^2+][SCN^0], and [SCN^0] is 1), so the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^{4} βk [SCN^-]^k )

So, given that, let's compute each term.

Given that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each βk [SCN^-]^k for k=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

k=0: β0 [SCN]^0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1*1=1.

k=1: β1 [SCN]^1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

k=2: β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

k=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

k=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

So sum all these terms:

sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016.

Let me compute that step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +0.4=2.3.

2.3 +0.063=2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now, the fraction f_2 is the term for k=2 (since the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2).

f_2 = (40 * 0.1^2 ) / 2.3646 = (40 * 0.01 ) /2.3646 = 0.4 /2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

So approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the sum is 1 +0.9=1.9, plus 0.4 is 2.3, plus 0.063 is 2.363, plus 0.0016 is 2.3646.

The numerator for f_2 is 0.4.

0.4 / 2.3646 = approximately 0.169, so yes, 16.9%.

So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, is that correct? Because according to my earlier approach, the fraction is based on each β being cumulative. But what if the given β are the stepwise constants?

Wait, in that case, the calculation would be different. Let me reconsider.

If the β's are stepwise, then the cumulative β for each complex would be the product of the stepwise constants. For n=2, the cumulative β would be β1 * β2 =9*40=360, for n=3, β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680, and for n=4, 22680 *16=362880.

In that case, the fractions would be based on these cumulative β's.

So let's recalculate using this approach.

Compute each term:

k=0: 1 * (0.1)^0=1.

k=1: β1 (stepwise) * [SCN]^1 =9*0.1=0.9.

k=2: β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

k=3: β1*β2*β3 * (0.1)^3=9*40*63 *0.001.

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 * 0.001=22.68.

k=4: β1*β2*β3*β4 * (0.1)^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the terms are:

k=0:1

k=1:0.9

k=2:3.6

k=3:22.68

k=4:36.288

Sum all these: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

The fraction f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05555 or 5.555%.

But that's not one of the options. So this suggests that the initial approach, treating βn as cumulative, is the correct method, leading to f_2=16.9%.

But wait, the given options include 16.9% (option D), which would be the correct answer if the β's are cumulative.

Wait, but why would the β4 be lower than β3 in the cumulative case? Because β4 is the product of all stepwise up to 4, which is 362880, much higher than β3 (22680). So in the cumulative case, β4 is higher than β3, but in the given problem, β4 is 16 which is lower than β3=63.

This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the β's provided are the stepwise constants, but that approach leads to a fraction of about 5.5%, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the β's are cumulative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Another way to model this is to assume that each β is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So for the complex [Co(SCN)_n], the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But considering that adding more ligands may reduce the fraction of lower n complexes. Wait, but in this case, the sum for all species would be:

sum = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

Each term is βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But since [Co^2+] is present in all terms, it can be factored out. Let me set [Co^2+] = c =1e-2 M.

Wait, but the sum would be:

sum = c + β1 c [SCN] + β2 c [SCN]^2 + β3 c [SCN]^3 + β4 c [SCN]^4.

Wait, but that can't be right, because βn is the cumulative constant for each complex. So, perhaps the fraction of each species is [Co(SCN)_n] / sum_total, where sum_total is the sum of all [Co] species.

So:

fraction_n = (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, when βn is the cumulative constant, each term in the denominator is βn [SCN]^n multiplied by [Co^2+].

But [Co^2+] is present in all terms, so when taking the ratio, [Co^2+] cancels out.

So the fraction is:

f_n = βn [SCN]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So with given [SCN] =0.1 M, and β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

1 (for [Co^2+]).

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all:1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646.

The denominator is 2.3646.

So for n=2, f_2=0.4 /2.3646 ≈0.169 or 16.9%.

Which matches option D.

So the correct answer is option D:16.9%.


To determine the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]) among all cobalt-containing species, we use the given stability constants (β) and the concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions. The stability constants are provided as β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, where βn represents the cumulative stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]. The concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, and the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is given by:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
   \]  
   Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) corresponds to the free Co²⁺ ion, and \( [\text{SCN}^-]^k \) is the concentration term for the \( k \)-th complex.

2. **Compute Terms for Each Complex**:  
   Using \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), calculate each term:  
   - \( \beta_0 [\text{SCN}^-]^0 = 1 \)  
   - \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)  
   - \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \)  
   - \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \)  
   - \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \)  

3. **Sum of All Terms**:  
   Add the terms to find the denominator:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]  
   Converting to a percentage:  
   \[
   f_2 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

ANSWER: D
