Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6, right? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

Hmm, first I need to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving particle is given by the total energy formula, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

Wait, but wait. The question says "energy of the RHIC", which probably refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or does it include the rest mass energy as well? I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy? I think it depends on the context, but maybe I should check what the formula requires.

So, let's start by figuring out the velocity. The speed is 0.96c, so I should compute gamma for this speed. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that.

v = 0.96c
v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c²
1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784)
So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Hmm, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The atomic mass of lithium-6 is approximately... wait, what's the mass of a Li-6 nucleus? I know that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So let's compute the total rest mass.

Wait, but wait, perhaps using the atomic mass in atomic mass units would be easier, then convert to GeV. Alternatively, I can compute the mass in GeV/c².

So, for Li-6: 6 nucleons (3 protons + 3 neutrons). Let me get the masses.

Proton mass, m_p ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²
Neutron mass, m_n ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²

So for Li-6:
Total rest mass m = 3*m_p + 3*m_n
= 3*(938.272 + 939.565) MeV/c²
Wait, no, each proton is 938.272, each neutron is 939.565. So:

m = 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565)
= (2814.816) + (2818.695)
= 5633.511 MeV/c²
