Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics concepts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. The setup says that this approximation assumes nucleons behave like free particles. So the question is asking which four assumptions together imply this impulse approximation.

The options are 1-4, and I need to pick the right combination. The options A to D each pair these assumptions.

Let me restate the problem. The impulse approximation is used when considering interactions like electroweak. In this case, the nucleus is treated in a way that each nucleon is acting almost independently, as if they're free. So the assumptions must support treating each nucleon as if it's not influenced much by the others.

Looking at the four assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

I need to figure out which three of these are necessary.

Let me think about what each assumption implies.

Assumption 1: Interaction only with individual nucleons. That means the interaction doesn't involve pairs or other collective behavior. So each nucleon is treated separately, which aligns with the idea of free particles.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparent in what sense? Oh, perhaps it means that other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction. So, when a particle interacts with the nucleus, it only interacts with one nucleon and passes through the others. Like maybe in a collision, the projectile only sees one nucleon, and others don't affect it. So this supports the idea that each nucleon acts independently because the others aren't involved in the interaction.

Assumption 3: Quarks in the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might imply that they're moving at speeds much lower than light, so relativistic effects are negligible. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, in the impulse approximation, you treat the nucleon as a point particle, right? If the quarks are non-relativistic, their internal dynamics are not highly complex, so the nucleon can be treated as a whole, point-like object. That makes sense because if the internal structure (quarks) were relativistic, you might have to consider more complicated dynamics, but the approximation probably ignores that. So this assumption supports treating the nucleon as a free, simple particle.

Assumption 4: The selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. That makes sense because if the nucleon isn't bound, it can move freely, like a free particle in the nucleus. So this would eliminate any effects from the strong nuclear force holding the nucleon in place, allowing it to behave as if it's free.

Now, the question is which three assumptions together imply the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation is when each nucleon is treated as a free particle, so the interactions are treated as if they
