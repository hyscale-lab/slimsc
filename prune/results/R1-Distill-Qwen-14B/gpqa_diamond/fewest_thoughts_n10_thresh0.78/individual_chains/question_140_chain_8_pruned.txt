Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. There's also a part about a keto acid reacting with substance X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. Finally, I need to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. I'm thinking maybe this is a common reaction. When substances react violently and release a gas, it's often something like metals reacting with acids. Oh wait, but Y is a liquid. So maybe Y is water? Or maybe a strong acid or base.

Gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. If W is H2O, but no, H has 1 proton, O has 8. Wait, but each molecule. Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, the total number of protons equals the total neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is H2 gas? But H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's hydrogen, but isotopes could change that). Hmm, maybe not. What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), but O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So a CO2 molecule would have 6+8*2 = 22 protons, and 6+8*2 = 22 neutrons (assuming 12C and 16O). So 22 each. So that fits the condition.

But wait, CO2 is a gas, and is released when metals react with acids perhaps. But let me think again. Another possibility: NH3? Let's see. Nitrogen has 7 protons, hydrogen has 1. So each molecule has 7+3*1 = 10 protons. Neutrons: nitrogen typically has 7 neutrons (14N), and hydrogen has 0 (protium). So 7 + 0*3 =7 neutrons. Doesn't match 10 protons, so no. Not matching.

Another gas: CH4. Each molecule has 6 protons (C) + 4*1 (H) =10 protons. Neutrons: C is 6 (12C), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 vs 6, nope. Doesn't fit.

What about O2? O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits. But wait, O2 is a diatomic gas, and when something reacts violently, maybe like a metal reacting with water?

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think about another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water ice? But no, ice melts at 273 K. Oh, wait, 277 is a bit higher, but close. Maybe it's another compound. Or perhaps it's another element?

Wait, another thought: if B is a solid that forms when G is heated, perhaps it's a metal oxide or something else. Alternatively, if B is a metal, like sodium or potassium? No, because their melting points are much lower. Alternatively, maybe B is something like water. Wait, the melting point of water is 273.15 K. So 277 is close, maybe considering some approximation.

So if B is water, then when G is heated, it releases water. What could G be? Maybe a hydroxide that on heating decomposes into something else, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, which on heating decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide, but then I'm not sure how that connects.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of X with Y produces a carbonate. Let's think about metals reacting with water. If X is a metal, and Y is water, then the reaction would produce H2 gas (maybe), but earlier I thought CO2, but perhaps that's not right.

Wait, maybe Y is a strong acid. Let's say X is a metal, and Y is a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. The reaction would produce a salt, H2 gas, and some other products. But not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and Y's reaction is a precipitate G. Then, when heated, G releases B. Let's think about a possible precipitate that upon heating would release a substance with a melting point near 277 K. For example, suppose G is a carbonate. Heating a carbonate typically decomposes it into a metal oxide, CO2, and maybe some other products. But CO2 is a gas, so perhaps B is CO2? But earlier we thought about CO2 as gas W, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps G is a hydroxide. When heated, it might decompose. For example, copper hydroxide on heating becomes copper oxide and water. So if B is water, that's possible. Let me see. So if X is a metal, Y is an acid, the reaction produces a metal hydroxide as a precipitate? No, wait, acids and metals usually produce salts, not hydroxides, unless perhaps if the acid is in excess.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal carbonate. Reacting with an acid would release CO2 gas, and form a salt.

Wait, let me think again about the gas W. If W is CO2, then in the reaction between X and Y, CO2 is released. So perhaps X is a metal carbonate. Y is an acid. Then the reaction would be X (metal carbonate) + acid → salt + CO2 + water. But then Y would be a liquid acid, like H2SO4 or HCl.

But the problem says that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Hmm, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction should produce a salt, which may be soluble or insoluble. If it's a precipitate, maybe the acid is weaker, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. Then X (a carbonate) reacting with a base would produce a hydroxide as a precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is NaOH, but that reaction would not produce a precipitate since both are soluble. Wait, no, CaCO3 is insoluble in NaOH... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is water, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: when a metal reacts with a liquid (like water), it produces H2 gas. So W is H2. Then, the molecule of H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1H), so 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match the condition of same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. So that's not possible. So W can't be H2.

Wait, what about O2? Each O2 molecule has 16 protons (8 per O atom) and 16 neutrons (8 per O atom, so 16 total). So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that fits the condition. So gas W is O2?

But why would a reaction produce O2? Maybe if X is a peroxide or something that decomposes. Or maybe if X is a metal reacting with water under certain conditions.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is a strong acid, then the reaction produces CO2 and water. So W would be CO2. Let's see, for CO2, each molecule has 6 protons (C) + 16 (O) * 2. Wait, no, wait. Each CO2 molecule has 6 protons (from C) + (8 protons each from two O atoms) = 6 + 16 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C in 12C has 6, each O in 16O has 8, so total 6 + 8 *2 =22. So protons=22, neutrons=22. That fits the condition. So W is CO2.

So gas W is CO2, which makes sense. So the reaction between X and Y produces CO2 as a gas. Then precipitate G is probably a salt. If Y is an acid, maybe X is a carbonate, and the reaction produces a salt, which is a precipitate.

Wait, but if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, the reaction would be: X (metal carbonate) + HCl (acid) → salt (metal chloride) + CO2 + H2O. But if the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. So perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal with a high carbonate solubility? Wait, most metal carbonates are insoluble in water, but some are more so. Alternatively, maybe Y is a weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate, and Y is a carbonate solution. But that might not produce CO2.

Wait, maybe X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate solution. Then the reaction would produce CO2. For example, a metal reacting with carbonate acid (like sodium carbonate solution) would produce CO2 if the metal is more reactive. But I'm not sure about the precipitate in that case.

Perhaps another angle: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a carboxylic acid group and a ketone group. When it reacts with X, which is a reagent, perhaps X is something like a reducing agent. For example, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, hydrazine is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, but that's in the presence of a base. Alternatively, maybe X is a base.

Wait, another thought: if the reaction product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. If the keto acid reacts with NaOH, it would form a salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem also says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X has an isotope where one element is heavier. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. If X is a
