Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Hmm, because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 is 8. So the substituents are probably two groups attached to the ring, each contributing a certain number of carbons.

The FTIR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is a halogen such as Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the benzene ring. So the two groups are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl compound and another is a halogen? Let me think.

Wait, but a carbonyl group is typically in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So if one substituent is a carbonyl, like maybe an acetyl group (COCH3), but that would add two carbons. Or perhaps a carbonyl as part of another functional group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so maybe it's a naphthalene system? No, no, naphthalene is 10 carbons. The question says 8 carbons in total, so it's a benzene ring with two substituents that add up to 2 carbons each or maybe one adds 2 and another adds 0, but that doesn't make sense because the substituents would probably have more carbons.

Wait, no, wait. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituent carbons are 2. So perhaps each substituent is one carbon each. So two substituents, each with one carbon. But a carbonyl group is typically part of a larger group, like maybe a ketone (CO-) attached to the ring. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Like, for example, one substituent is -COCH3

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm. Let's break this down. A di-substituted benzene ring has two substituents. The ring itself is 6-membered, so each substitution is on adjacent carbons if they are para, but wait no, di-substituted can be either para, ortho, or meta. But wait, the ring is 6-membered, so it's benzene, right? Because 6-membered aromatic rings are usually benzene derivatives.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Benzene has 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent would add a certain number of carbons. So the substituents could be two groups each with one carbon, or perhaps one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero? No, because di-substituted means two substituents on the ring.

Wait, but each substituent is attached to the ring. So each substituent is probably a group that adds a certain number of carbons. Let me think: If the ring has 6 carbons, and the molecule has 8, then the substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon group. For example, maybe two -CH2 groups, or one -CH2CH2 something? Wait, no. Wait, 6 (ring) + substituents = 8, so substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So two substituents each adding 1 carbon. So each substituent is a methyl group? No, because methyl is -CH3, which is one carbon. So two substituents would add two carbons. Wait, but benzene with two methyl groups would have 6+2=8 carbons. Wait, but that would be ethyl groups? No, methyl groups are each one carbon. So if the substituents are two methyl groups, the molecule would have 6 + 2*(1) =8 carbons. But the
