Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm. Let's break this down. A di-substituted benzene ring has two substituents. The ring itself is 6-membered, so each substitution is on adjacent carbons if they are para, but wait no, di-substituted can be either para, ortho, or meta. But wait, the ring is 6-membered, so it's benzene, right? Because 6-membered aromatic rings are usually benzene derivatives.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Benzene has 6 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent would add a certain number of carbons. So the substituents could be two groups each with one carbon, or perhaps one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero? No, because di-substituted means two substituents on the ring.

Wait, but each substituent is attached to the ring. So each substituent is probably a group that adds a certain number of carbons. Let me think: If the ring has 6 carbons, and the molecule has 8, then the substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon group. For example, maybe two -CH2 groups, or one -CH2CH2 something? Wait, no. Wait, 6 (ring) + substituents = 8, so substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So two substituents each adding 1 carbon. So each substituent is a methyl group? No, because methyl is -CH3, which is one carbon. So two substituents would add two carbons. Wait, but benzene with two methyl groups would have 6+2=8 carbons. Wait, but that would be ethyl groups? No, methyl groups are each one carbon. So if the substituents are two methyl groups, the molecule would have 6 + 2*(1) =8 carbons. But the
