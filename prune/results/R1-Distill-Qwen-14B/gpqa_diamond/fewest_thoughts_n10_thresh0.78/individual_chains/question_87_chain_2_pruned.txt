Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a specific compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, wait, the benzene ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Hmm, because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 is 8. So the substituents are probably two groups attached to the ring, each contributing a certain number of carbons.

The FTIR data shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like -X, where X is a halogen such as Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the benzene ring. So the two groups are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl compound and another is a halogen? Let me think.

Wait, but a carbonyl group is typically in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So if one substituent is a carbonyl, like maybe an acetyl group (COCH3), but that would add two carbons. Or perhaps a carbonyl as part of another functional group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so maybe it's a naphthalene system? No, no, naphthalene is 10 carbons. The question says 8 carbons in total, so it's a benzene ring with two substituents that add up to 2 carbons each or maybe one adds 2 and another adds 0, but that doesn't make sense because the substituents would probably have more carbons.

Wait, no, wait. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituent carbons are 2. So perhaps each substituent is one carbon each. So two substituents, each with one carbon. But a carbonyl group is typically part of a larger group, like maybe a ketone (CO-) attached to the ring. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Like, for example, one substituent is -COCH3
