Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're observing a single atom, and we know from previous experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the key here is that the decay process is memoryless. Oh right! The memoryless property of exponential decay means that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have gone by without decay shouldn't affect the future probability. But wait, the question gives a 32% chance in 100 minutes. How does that tie in?

I remember that the decay probability can be modeled with an exponential function. The formula for the probability of decay over time is something like P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, sometimes I see it written as P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ), where τ is the mean lifetime. Oh wait! Because λ is the reciprocal of τ, so τ = 1/λ.

The given data says that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, which is 0.32.
