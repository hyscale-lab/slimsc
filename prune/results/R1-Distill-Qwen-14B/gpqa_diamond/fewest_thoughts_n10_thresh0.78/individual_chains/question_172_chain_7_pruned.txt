Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms depends on temperature. The question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, excitation in LTE probably relates to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). In this problem, the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, wait, let me think. The question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So maybe the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2.

Let me define the variables. Let me say that the ratio for star_1 is n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Because star_1's excitation is twice as much as star_2's.

But wait, the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because the same energy level is being considered. So ΔE is the same for both stars, 1.38e-23 J.

So for each star, the ratio of the populations is given by:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

Wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but sometimes people write it as exp(ΔE/(k T)) depending on the state. Wait no, because higher energy states are less populated. So if the energy is higher, the denominator in the ratio is higher, making the population ratio smaller. So the formula should be:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, let me double-check. The energy levels are E_upper and E_lower, so ΔE = E_upper - E_lower, which is positive. So the ratio is exp( -(E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So yes, that's correct.

So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
Similarly, for star_2, n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, n1_upper / n1_lower is twice as much as n2_upper / n2_lower. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

Substituting in the expressions:
