Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy.

Wait, the transition wavelength given is 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, right? Since wavelength λ is related to energy by E = hc/λ. So the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, the ratio n2/n1 (where n is the number of atoms in each level) is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when spots are present, the temperature is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n2/n1 would change.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how the ratio depends on temperature. If the energy difference is fixed because the transition wavelength is fixed, then as temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller. Because denominator is kT, which is smaller, so (E2-E1)/(kT) is larger, so the exponential is smaller.

So if the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 would be lower than
