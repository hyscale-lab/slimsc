Alright, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down what I know.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the question is about their photospheric compositions, specifically the ratio of silicon atoms. So, maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here, unless it's about their lifetimes or something else, but the given data is about elemental abundances, so perhaps I can set that aside for now.

The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method (which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements). The given data points are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I think the [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y, relative to the Sun. Wait, no, more accurately, it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y, compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log10(n_X/n_Y / n_X/n_Y)_sun) = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun) ) ) = log10( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) ) )

Hmm, maybe there's a better way to think about this. Let me think in terms of these abundance ratios.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si_Star1 / n_Si_Star2) or something like that. Wait no, wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So that would be (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2). Hmm, but wait, the problem gives data for both stars. So I have to find each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun, then find the ratio between the two.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me parse the given data.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So that means the abundance of Fe in Star_1 relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log10(nFe_1/nH_
