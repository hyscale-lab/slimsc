Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no—the question says that compound A was treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give the R product, and compound B was treated with BH3 and H+ to give the S product. Or wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, the question says: A + LiBH4 + H+ gives R product, and B + BH3 + H+ gives S product. So, what's the starting material for each case?

The options are about the configurations of A and B. So, the starting materials are A and B, which are treated with different reagents, leading to different stereoisomers.

I remember that when you reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, the stereochemistry can be influenced by the reducing agent. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is another, but I think they're used in different contexts. Oh right, BH3 is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, in some cases, like when reducing ketones, the mechanism might differ. Wait, no, wait—LiBH4 and BH3 typically do different things. Wait, no
