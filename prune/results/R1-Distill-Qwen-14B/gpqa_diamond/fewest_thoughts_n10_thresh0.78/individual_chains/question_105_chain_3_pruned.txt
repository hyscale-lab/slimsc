Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm. Let's see. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. They're comparing this to an exoplanet transit, which also causes brightness changes. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star.

Alright, let's break down the information given. The star has the same radius as the Sun, so Rstar is R_sun. The spots are covering one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor, right, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, that means 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler, I suppose. Oh, wait, no. The problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. Wait, so the spots are either 1000 K hotter or cooler? Well, usually sunspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so I think they're 1000 K cooler. So spot temperature T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.

Photometric time-series observations would show brightness variations because the star is rotating, modulating which spots face us. Now, the question states that this situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the brightness dips. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting the star would cause a dip in brightness as it blocks some light.

The task is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star such that the amplitude of the light curve is the same as what's caused by the spots. So the problem is comparing the two effects: spot-induced brightness variation and planet transit-induced variation.

Wait, but how do these two affect the light curve amplitude?

For the planet transit: the dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet compared to the star. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius. So the relative change in flux is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

For the spots: When a spot is on the visible side, it contributes less flux. Since the spots are cooler, during their rotation, the observed flux from the star varies as the spots come into view. The total brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

Let me think. The star's flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4 * (Rstar^2 / (4 D^2))
