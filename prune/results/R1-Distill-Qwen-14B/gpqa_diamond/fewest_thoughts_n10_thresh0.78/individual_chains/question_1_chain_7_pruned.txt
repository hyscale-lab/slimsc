Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, the two states might overlap in their energy ranges, making them indistinguishable.

So the condition is ΔE ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2. But which one has the larger uncertainty? Since ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt, the shorter the lifetime (smaller Δt), the larger the energy uncertainty. So E1 has a larger ΔE. So let's compute the two.

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for E1's uncertainty:
ΔE1 = ħ / (Δt1) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1.05e-25 J.

Wait, but the options are in eV
