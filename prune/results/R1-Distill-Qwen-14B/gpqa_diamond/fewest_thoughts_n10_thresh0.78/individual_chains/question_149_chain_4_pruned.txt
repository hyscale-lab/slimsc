Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integral seems right, but why two peaks? And they ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So it's not like each peak is coupling with another.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound has two peaks at elevated temperature, same mass, same intensity. So same mass means same molecular weight, right? But what could cause two peaks in LC-MS but same mass? Maybe it's a separation issue, but if the mass is the same, perhaps it's not something like a fragment. Or maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. Because diastereomers would have different retention times but same mass, and enantiomers would have same retention time but same mass. Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks of same intensity. So if it's a racemic mixture of enantiomers, would the LC separate them? No, because enantiomers are not separated by normal HPLC. So two peaks with same mass and same intensity in LC-MSâ€”maybe it's diastereomers?

Wait, but if the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. What could cause that? Well, maybe the molecule is in a different conformation, but same proton environment. Or perhaps some kind of coupling. But they said coupling isn't the issue. Maybe if the molecule is a diastereomer, the alpha-proton's environment could be slightly different. Wait, but in diastereomers, the environment might vary slightly, but why two peaks? Hmm.

Alternatively, if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same peaks because the protons are equivalent in each enantiomer. Unless the peak splitting is due to something else. But the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton, so in a racemic mix, the same structure, so the same NMR. So that can't be it. So if the NMR shows two peaks for same proton, but the molecule isn't enantiomers, what else? Maybe the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, which
