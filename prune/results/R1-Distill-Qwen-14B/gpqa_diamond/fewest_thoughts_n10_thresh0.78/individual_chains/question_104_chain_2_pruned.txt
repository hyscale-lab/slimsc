Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let's see what I remember.

Alright, the setup: both stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method was used, which detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

So, planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us. But the shift in wavelength is related to the velocity via the Doppler effect formula.

The Doppler shift formula is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c. But wait, the formula can be rearranged. Oh right, when the star moves towards us, the wavelength shifts to blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, it's redshifted. The maximum shift corresponds to the star's maximum velocity, right?

So the shift they're talking about is the semi-amplitude of the velocity. Let me think. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )) )? Hmm, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ) )^(1/3) )

But since the planets are in circular orbits, e is zero, so that term goes away. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is about 17 times Earth, and Sun is much bigger, so M_p << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. And since sin i is 1 for a circular orbit (edge-on, maximum effect), that's taken care of.

So the simplified formula would be:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * ( 1 / ( (P) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( ... )) Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula as:

K = ( (2πG) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe I should
