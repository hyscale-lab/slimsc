Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. So, the options give different pairs of kinetic energies, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the daughter particles must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense because the initial momentum is zero, so the vector sum of the daughters' momenta should be zero.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

Wait, neutrinos are tricky. They have very little mass, right? Or do they have mass? I think for most problems, we treat neutrinos as massless. Or wait, no, in some cases, they have a negligible mass compared to the other particles. So in this case, maybe the neutrino's mass can be considered zero. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the pion's is 139.6. So the decay must produce a muon and neutrino, so the energy available is the pion's rest mass minus the muon's rest mass. Because the neutrino has negligible mass, but perhaps it's not zero. Oh, but wait, in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can assume that it's negligible compared to the other masses. So maybe the problem is treating the neutrino as massless.

But wait, if the neutrino has a mass, then it would contribute to the total energy and momentum. But perhaps in this problem, they are ignoring the neutrino's rest mass. So I'll proceed with that assumption.
