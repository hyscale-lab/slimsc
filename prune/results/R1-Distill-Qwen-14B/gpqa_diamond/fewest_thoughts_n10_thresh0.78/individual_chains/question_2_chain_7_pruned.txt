Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let's break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached, right? So it's like a benzene ring connected to a CH2-CH2-CHO, but wait, no, trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a double bond. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no, wait. Let me think. Wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, actually, no. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, that's not right. Cinnamic acid is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the aldehyde would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Oh wait, wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Oh wait, no, because "cinnamaldehyde" is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached to a propenyl group, I think. So structure is benzaldehyde with a double bond. Like, it's (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, let me get this right. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, but in that case, the double bond would be between the benzene and the aldehyde. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be something else. Oh wait, wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde where the benzene ring is attached to a CH2 group, which is then attached to a CH group, which is double bonded to the aldehyde. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH
