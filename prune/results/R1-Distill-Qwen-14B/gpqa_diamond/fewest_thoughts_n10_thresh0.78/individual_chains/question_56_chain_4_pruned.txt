Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the 3,0,0 state decaying to the 1,0,0 state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions follow certain selection rules.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions—what were they again? Oh right, for the hydrogen atom, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by one unit. And the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, +1, or -1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. That means n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. Wait a second, but if the initial and final states both have l=0, that's a problem because for a dipole transition, l must change by ±1. So, how does this decay happen via two dipole transitions?

Oh, right. So the decay must go through an intermediate state. So from 3,0,0, it goes to another state, and then from that state to 1,0,0. Let me think about what the possible intermediate states are.

The initial state is n=3, l=0. So possible transitions from here would have to change l from 0 to 1 because l can only change by ±1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. Now, for n, it can stay the same or change. Wait, but from n=3 to n=2, since 3 > 2, but I'm not sure if n can change by more than one. Oh wait, no, in dipole transitions, n can change by any integer, but typically, the most probable transitions are Δn = ±1. But wait, in this case, we're going from n=3 to n=2 (Δn=-1) and then n=2 to n=1 (Δn=-1). So that makes sense for two dipole transitions.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to a state with l=1. What are the possible m values? The initial m is 0, so the intermediate can have m=0, +1, or -1. So the possible states are |3,1,0⟩, |3,1,1⟩, and |3,1,-1⟩. Wait, but wait, the initial state is 3,0,0. So for the first transition, the l must go from 0 to 1, so the state after the first transition would be |3,1, m⟩ where m is 0, ±1.

But wait, the final state after two steps is 1,0,0. So the second transition must take l from 1 to 0. So the intermediate state must have l=1, and the final state l=0. So the intermediate state is |n,1,m⟩, and then the next transition brings it to |n', 0, m'⟩ with m' related to m.

But wait, the second transition is from the intermediate state to 1,0,0. So the intermediate state's n must be 2 because 3→2→1. Wait, no. Let me think. Starting at 3,0,0. The first transition can take us to a state with n=3, l=1, m=0,1,-1. Then, from there, we have to transition to the state 1,0,0. So the second transition must go from a state with n=2, l=1, m=... So wait, no, that's not possible because n=3 to n=1 is a change of 2. Oh, because each dipole transition can only change n by one. So the first step would take n from 3 to 2, and then the second step from 2 to 1.

Wait, let me correct that. So first, from 3,0,0, go down to 2,1,m, and then from 2,1,m go down to 1,0,0. So the intermediate state is n=2, l=1, m= something.

So the first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. The selection rules: Δn = ±1 (since it's a dipole transition). So 3→2, which is Δn=-1. l changes from 0→1, which is Δl=+1. So that's allowed. Now, m can change by 0, ±1. So m starts at 0, so possible m in intermediate state is 0, +1, -1. So possible states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition: from 2,1,m to 1,0,0. Here, Δn is -1 again, which is allowed. l changes from 1→0, which is Δl=-1, allowed by selection rules. m changes from m → 0. So for m to become 0, the change must be such that m' = m + Δm = 0. So Δm can be 0, ±1.

Wait, the second transition must have m change from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0 in the final state. So, for each possible intermediate state, can we reach m=0 in the final state?

Let's list the possibilities:

1. Intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩:
   - Then, m=0. To reach m=0 in the final state, Δm can be 0 (so m remains 0). So that's allowed. So this is a possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

2. Intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩:
   - Then m=1. To reach m=0, Δm must be -1. Which is allowed. So another possible path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0.

3. Intermediate state is |2,1,-1⟩:
   - m=-1. To reach m=0, Δm must be +1. Which is allowed. So path: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0.

So all three are possible. But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options given have specific paths and probabilities.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3.

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → ... with 1/4.

Option D: It says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. But I'm not sure about the probabilities.

Wait, the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So each of the paths A, B, C, D are possible, but each has a certain probability.

We need to find the probability of each possible two-step transition and see which option matches.

But how do we calculate the transition probabilities for each step?

For each dipole transition, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, so the matrix elements involve integrals of the wavefunctions multiplied by Y_{1
