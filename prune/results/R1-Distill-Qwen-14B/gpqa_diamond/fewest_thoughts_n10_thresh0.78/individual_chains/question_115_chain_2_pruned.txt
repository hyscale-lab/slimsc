Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and it has a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So I remember that in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. And because energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' directions and energies must add up correctly.

Wait, right. So the initial system has the electron and positron moving towards each other. Let's think about their momenta. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, their momenta are opposite.

But wait, the Lorentz factor is given. Lorentz factor gamma is equal to E/(m c²), right? So for each particle, their energy is gamma * m c². Also, their momentum is gamma * m v. Since v is a significant fraction of c in this case, we can't ignore relativistic effects.

But wait, the problem says after the collision, both annihilate into two photons. The photons have equal energy. So energy must be conserved, and momentum must be conserved.

Let me think about the setup. Let's set up a coordinate system where the x-axis is the direction of motion of the electron and positron. So the electron is moving along +x (from left to right), and the positron is moving along -x (from right to left).

Wait, no, actually, the electron is moving from the left, so that would be the +x direction. The positron is moving from the right, so it's moving along -x.

So, the initial momentum of the electron is p
