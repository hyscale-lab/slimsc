Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out. So the question is about what happens when a certain compound reacts with hydrogen bromide. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure to visualize it better.

Wait, the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is from the butenyl group. Let's break down the butenyl part. It's but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I number from the oxygen). Oh wait, but wait butenyl is four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2-CH2? No wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH- but no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 if it's 1-yl. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, but that's a single bond. Oh, wait no: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-? No. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH=CH- but that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me count the positions correctly.

Butenyl is four carbons. The 3-en- would be the position of the double bond. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we start counting from the substituent). Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions are 1
