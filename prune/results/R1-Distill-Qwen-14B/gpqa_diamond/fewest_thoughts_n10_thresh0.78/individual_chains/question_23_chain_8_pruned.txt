Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. The options are four different sets of products, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I need to understand what's happening in the reaction. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached to it. The other part of the ether is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So, the structure is a benzene ring with O connected to a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group, but wait, no—wait, but it's but-3-en-1-yl. Let me get that right.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2 is but, but the double bond is at position 3. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, but but has four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but numbering from the first carbon. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that can't be since but has only four carbons.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the substituents are on the but-3-en-1-yl group. The but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but that's impossible—since but is four carbons, the double bond would be between C3 and C4, but that would make it a trans or cis arrangement, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I got the position wrong.

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature,

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out. So the question is about what happens when a certain compound reacts with hydrogen bromide. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Hmm, let me draw that structure to visualize it better.

Wait, the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether part is from the butenyl group. Let's break down the butenyl part. It's but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I number from the oxygen). Oh wait, but wait butenyl is four carbons. So the structure is CH2-CH-C(CH3)2-CH2? No wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH- but no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 if it's 1-yl. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, but that's a single bond. Oh, wait no: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂-? No. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH=CH- but that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me count the positions correctly.

Butenyl is four carbons. The 3-en- would be the position of the double bond. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if we start counting from the substituent). Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions are 1
