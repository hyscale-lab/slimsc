Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct starting materials A and B. Let me read through it again and think about what's going on.

The problem says a chemist did two reactions with two unknown compounds, treating each with different reducing agents. One reaction uses LiBH4 and H+, and the other uses BH3 and H+. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. So the products are enantiomers, I think. Wait, no, wait. Because when the starting materials are different, maybe the products are different but they have opposite configurations?

Wait, no, the products are both 4-ethyl... but one is R and the other S. So the product configurations are different. So the two reactions are leading to the same molecule but with opposite configurations. Hmm, interesting. So maybe each reaction is a reduction leading to a specific configuration.

I remember that when you have a ketone and you reduce it, especially in cyclic systems, the stereochemistry of the starting material can influence the product. Wait, but in this case, the starting materials are treated with different reducing agents. Oh, rightâ€”LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is maybe a less common one, but wait, I think BH3 is typically used in certain conditions, like in hydroboration reactions.

Wait, but wait, the products are both ketones. Wait, that can't be
