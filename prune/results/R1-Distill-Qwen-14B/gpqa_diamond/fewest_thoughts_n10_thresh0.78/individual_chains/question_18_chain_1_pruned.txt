Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think mass directly affects the ratios here because the question is about elemental abundances. The key data are the [X/Y] ratios, which are logarithmic.

So, the given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium to silicon ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times the Sun's.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, iron to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Magnesium to hydrogen in Star_2 is same as Sun.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So, I need to find [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Let me think about the Sun's composition. The photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. That means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) =7-12=-5. So nMg/nH is 10^(-5).

Wait, wait, the formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

But wait, for the Sun, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) = [Fe/H]_sun. But in this case, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5 -12= -4.5? I think so, but let me make sure. Oh, wait, no. The question says that the given photospheric composition for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and same for Mg. So that's exactly how they're giving [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are 0 for the stars. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Star_1's Fe abundance is same as Sun. Similarly, Star_2's Mg is same as Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → log(nFe/n
