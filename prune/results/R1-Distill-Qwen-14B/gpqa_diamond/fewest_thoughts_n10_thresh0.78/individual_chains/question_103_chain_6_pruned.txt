Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.

Hmm, let me break down the target molecule. The main structure is a phenyl group attached to ethan-1-one. So, that's a ketone where the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring. Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring, there's a bromo group and a nitro group. Their positions are 3 and 5, respectively. So, the ring has nitro at position 5 and bromo at position 3. That makes them meta to each other, but wait, noâ€”wait, 3-bromo and 5-nitro would actually be in positions that are meta relative to each other. Wait, let's think: numbering the benzene ring. Let's say the ketone is in position 1 (since it's 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one). Then the other substituents are at 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). Let me visualize that: so the positions are 1 (where the ketone is attached), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, no, actually, the substituents are on the benzene ring. The ethanone is a substituent attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ethanone group, a bromo group, and a nitro group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one group is attached to the benzene ring, making it a phenyl group substituted with Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ethanone (as a phenyl group?), wait no. Wait, the ethanone is at position 1, attached to the benzene ring, which has Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. So the benzene ring with the ketone (as a substituent) and the other two groups.

So, the starting
