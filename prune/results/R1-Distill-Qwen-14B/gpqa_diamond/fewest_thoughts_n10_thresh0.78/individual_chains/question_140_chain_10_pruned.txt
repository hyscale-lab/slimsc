Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is almost 3 degrees Celsius. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction suggests something like a rapid reaction, maybe an acid-base reaction, or perhaps something more vigorous like a metal reacting with an acid.

The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule of W must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 is a gas, but its molecular structure is different. Wait, maybe something like H2O? No, because H2O's molecule is H2O, but for each molecule, the total protons in the molecule (2) and neutrons (O has 8 neutrons, so 8 each? Wait, each molecule of H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons and 8 neutrons). So total protons per molecule: 2 +8=10? No, wait, wait, the question says the molecule contains same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, the total protons = total neutrons. So for water: 2 H (each has 1p) and O (8p). So total p: 2+8=10. O has 8 neutrons, each H has 0. So total neutrons: 8. So 10 vs 8, so not equal. So that's not it.

Another gas: maybe CH4? No, because that's a hydrocarbon. Or perhaps CO, which has one C and one O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So molecule: 14 protons, 16 (if O is O-16) for neutrons. Not equal. Alternatively, maybe something like N2? But that's diatomic, but each N has 7 protons. So for N2, 14 protons, and 14 neutrons (each N is 7 neutrons: 7*2=14). Oh wait, that's possible. So for N2, each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that could be W.

Alternatively, maybe CO2
