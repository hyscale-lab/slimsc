Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I need to visualize that structure. So, the cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so like a CH2OH attached), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2 with a double bond from 1 to 2. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)CH2-CH2? Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. Wait, propene has three carbons: CH2=CH2-CH3. So the substituent would be the group from the double bond. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-? Wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH2-). Or perhaps it's the substituent where the double bond is between 1 and 2 positions. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- but attached where? Wait, maybe it's a substituent on the cyclohexane ring. So, position 5 is attached to a group that's CH2-C(=CH2)-? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's a vinyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure mentally. So, the cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl, which is -CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, wait, prop
