Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. We need to find which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f̄(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is the interaction term between the boson X and fermions. So, the X particle can decay into pairs of fermions. The possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, what determines the allowed decay products? Oh right, it's about whether the mass of the boson is greater than the sum of the masses of the fermion pair. Because for a decay to happen, the rest mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum is when they are produced at rest, so 2m_fermion).

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses to see which pairs are allowed.

The fermions are quarks and leptons. Let's consider all light fermions first.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But wait, top quark is really heavy, like around 173 GeV. So X is only 6 GeV, so it can't decay into top quarks. Similarly, bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV (I think that's roughly right). So 2m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because that would require at least 9 GeV, which X doesn't have. So any decay into b or t quarks is not allowed.

What about the other quarks?

u: very light, maybe around 2-5 MeV. So
