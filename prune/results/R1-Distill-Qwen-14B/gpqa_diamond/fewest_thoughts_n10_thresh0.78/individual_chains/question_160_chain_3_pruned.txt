Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity patterns in the far field. The question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large, so it's like approximating a circular aperture maybe?

Wait, when N is infinitely large, a polygon would approach a circle, right? So maybe the problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture? But wait, I thought the minima in a circular aperture occur at certain angles. The first minimum is at an angle θ given by something like sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the problem mentions that the apothems are all the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem a is related to the radius R as a = R cos(π/N), since each side corresponds to a central angle of 2π/N. But when N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So for very large N, the polygon is very close to a circle with radius a. So perhaps the problem reduces to the circular aperture case.

In the case of a circular aperture, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern has minima (dark rings) where the Bessel function of the first kind has zeros. The first minimum occurs at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(π a), but wait, let me think again. The formula for the minima is when the argument of the Bessel function J1 is equal to its first zero. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at θ such that (π a sinθ)/λ = π, so sinθ ≈ λ/(a π), but wait, wait, I might be getting mixed up.

Wait, the condition for the minima is when (a sinθ) = (m λ)/p, where p is some factor. For a circular aperture, the primary minima occur at θ where (a sinθ) = (λ) (m), but wait, no. Let me remember: For a circular aperture, the first minimum is when
