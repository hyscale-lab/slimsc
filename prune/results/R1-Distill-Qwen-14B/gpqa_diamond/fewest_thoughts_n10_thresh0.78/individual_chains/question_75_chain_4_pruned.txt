Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the transgenic mouse model isn't overexpressing the GADD45G protein as expected. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The question says they introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells and are having issues with overexpression.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to check if there's an issue that would prevent proper expression. Let me think about the possible options and what each implies.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm, the antigenic determinant is supposed to be at the N-terminus. If there's a missense, it might affect the protein's function, but would it prevent overexpression? I'm not sure. The problem is about expression level, not function.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. But looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in the coding sequence. Wait, the sequence is the plus strand, so it's the coding strand. Let me scan for these. Let's see... I'll look for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets.

Looking through the sequence:

- TAC is the start codon (ATG is start, but here it's ATG at the beginning. Wait, the first part is ATGTACCCATACGATGTT... Oh no, wait. The first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, etc. So looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking for TGA: I see a few instances. Let me scan. 

Looking through the entire sequence, I spot "GAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAG
