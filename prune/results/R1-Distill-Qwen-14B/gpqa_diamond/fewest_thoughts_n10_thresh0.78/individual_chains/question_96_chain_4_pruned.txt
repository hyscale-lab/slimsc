Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data includes the distance to the galaxy and the angular size of the event horizon. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says: The angular size θ of the event horizon is 1e-17 degrees, and the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 1e62, B)1e59, C)1e66, D)1e65 J/K.

I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the formula S = (k c^3 A)/(4 G ħ), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to calculate A first.

The area A of the event horizon is the area of a sphere, right? Wait, no, the event horizon is a sphere, but the area is 4πr², where r is the Schwarzschild radius. Or wait, the formula for A is 16π (G M / c²)². Oh yeah, that's another way to write it. So A = 16 π ( (G M) / (c²) )².

But wait, to get A, I might not need the mass. Another approach: since we're given the angular size θ, maybe we can find the diameter of the event horizon and then compute the radius. Then, find the Schwarzschild radius, which relates to the mass, and then plug that into the entropy formula.

So angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Oh, wait, I should convert that to radians because when calculating distances, angles are in radians. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance, which is the small angle approximation. Since θ is very small, this should hold.

So first, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180).

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Hmm, let me calculate that.

Wait, let me compute it precisely. 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π / 180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

But wait, the small angle approximation says that θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the tangent of θ, which is opposite over adjacent. So in this case, the diameter of the event horizon, D, is approximately θ_rad * d, where d is the distance.

So D ≈
