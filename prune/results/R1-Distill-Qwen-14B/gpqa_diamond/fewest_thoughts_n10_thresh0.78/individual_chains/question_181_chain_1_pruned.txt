Okay, so I've got this question here about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's roughly the time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that long to be observable here. But since the question is about the flux now, we're considering the effects after this time.

The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's fusion process. I remember that the pp chain has a few branches. The main pp-I branch is the most significant, producing helium-4. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less dominant. I think pp-III involves more protons and higher energy processes.

The question asks about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux(band1)/flux(band2) is what we need.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in various processes in the Sun. The main source of neutrinos is the fusion of protons into helium via the pp chain. The electron neutrinos (νe) are produced when a proton captures a positron (or maybe during beta decay steps in the chain). But also, other neutrinos like νμ and ντ are produced, but I think the question is focusing on νe.

In the pp chain, the main branch (pp-I) produces a 1 MeV neutrino. Then the pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher-energy neutrinos. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: the main pp-I reaction is two protons fusing, but that's not the end. There's a step where a proton captures a positron, releasing a neutron and a νe. Oh wait, no, perhaps the neutrinos are produced when a neutron is created, which then beta decays into a proton, emitting an electron and a νe.

Wait, in the pp-I branch, the main process is p + p → 2H (deuteron) + positron (e+) + νe. Wait, no, because p + p → 2H + e+ + νe. So that's the first step. The positron then annihilates with an electron, producing two photons. So the neutrino here is emitted when the proton captures the positron, but wait, the positron comes from the decay of a neutron in the next step. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Because if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux of higher-energy neutrinos would drop, while lower-energy ones remain unaffected.

Wait, in the Sun's core, the dominant neutrinos come from the pp chain. The main reaction in pp-I produces a neutrino with energy around 0.5 MeV, I think. But wait, let me get this right. The first step in the pp chain is p + p → 2H + e+ + νe. So the neutrino energy in this case is about 0.5 MeV. But wait, the energies mentioned here are in the hundreds of keV to a few MeV.

Wait, the question is considering the pp-III branch, not the main pp-I. So if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for the neutrino flux?

I remember that the pp-III branch involves reactions like 3He + 4He → 7Be + γ, which then captures an electron to become 7Li, but wait, that's more related to the triple-alpha process, which occurs in later stages of the Sun's life, perhaps. Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no, the pp chain has a few branches. The main pp-I branch is the most significant, producing about 86% of the Sun's helium. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant, maybe contributing a few percent. The pp-II branch produces 3He via 2H (deuteron) captures. The pp-III branch might involve higher-energy reactions, possibly producing higher-energy neutrinos.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, then the neutrinos from that process would stop. So if the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, then the flux in higher energy bands would drop, while the lower ones from the pp-I branch remain.

So band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. If pp-III produces neutrinos in the higher band, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. But if the main neutrinos are from pp-I around 0.5 MeV (500 keV), then the bands given are higher, perhaps in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 MeV.

Wait, but if pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would mean that the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is reduced. But what about band 1 (700-800 keV)?

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 0.8-1.0 MeV range. So if it's stopped, the band 2 (800-900 keV) would have less flux, but band 1 (700-800) would remain as before.

So the flux ratio (band1/band2) would increase, because band2's flux drops.

Wait, but what about other neutrino sources? Are there other reactions that contribute neutrinos in these energy ranges?

Another point: The question specifies that only the pp-III branch stopped. All other reactions remain as they were. So the neutrino production from other branches (pp-I, pp-II) and other processes (like the CNO cycle) continue unaffected.

Wait, but the pp-I branch produces neutrinos at lower energies. If the pp-III branch contributes more to higher energies, then the flux in the 800-900 keV band (band2) would decrease because the pp-III is the main contributor there,
