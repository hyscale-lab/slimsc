Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size. Hmm, I remember that black holes have entropy, which is a measure of disorder, right? I think it's related to the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, yes, I remember something about the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which says that the entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

The question gives me the angular size θ, which is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d to the galaxy is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are all powers of ten, so I probably don't need to calculate the exact value, just find the exponent.

First, I guess I need to find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ is given, and I know that the formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance. Wait, because θ is in radians, the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / distance. But wait, I should make sure I'm using the right units here. Oh right, because when θ is small, in radians, it's approximately equal to the ratio of the opposite side (which would be the diameter) over the adjacent side (distance). So θ ≈ 2R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon.

Wait no, wait. Oh no, the formula is θ (in radians) = (diameter of the object) / (distance to the object). Because the diameter is the size of the object, and when you're looking at it from a distance, the angle is about the size over the distance. So, θ_rad = (2R) / d.

So to find R, I can rearrange that: R ≈ (θ_rad * d) / 2.

But wait, the θ given is in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. How do I do that? Well, I know that 180 degrees is π radians, so to convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180.

So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that.

θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees, so θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. 1e-17 * π is about 3.1416e-17, divided by 180 is approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, but 1e-17 degrees is a very small angle. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * (π/180) = 1e-17 * 0.00001745
