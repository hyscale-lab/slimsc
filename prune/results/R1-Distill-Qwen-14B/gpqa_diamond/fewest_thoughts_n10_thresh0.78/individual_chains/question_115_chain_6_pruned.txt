Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, let me break this down. First, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, their initial momenta are along that axis.

Wait, the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are opposite in direction but along the same line before collision.

Let me think about the initial momenta. The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. The electron has gamma_e =4, the positron gamma_p=2. 

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. Since gamma is given, and for electrons and positrons, the mass m is the same (I think m_e is about 9.1e-31 kg). Wait, but in natural units where c=1 and so on, we often express this in terms of rest mass. 

Wait, but for energy and momentum, it's better to think in terms of four-vectors. The total four-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the four-momenta of the electron and positron. Then, after annihilation, the two photons must carry away the same total four-momentum.

Photons are massless, so their energy is related to their momentum by E = |p| c. So each photon's momentum is a vector, and their energies are the magnitudes of those vectors times c.

Wait the problem says both photons have the same energy. So their
