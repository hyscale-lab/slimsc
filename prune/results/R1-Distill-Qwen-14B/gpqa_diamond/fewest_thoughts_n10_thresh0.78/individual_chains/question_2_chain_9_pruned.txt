Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem starts with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The trans part probably refers to the substituents on the benzene ring. So, trans-cinnamaldehyde would have a benzene ring with a propenal group attached, right? So its structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzalacetophenone? No, wait, no. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, so it's an aromatic ring with a CH2-CHO group. Wait, no, no, I think it's an aromatic ring attached to a CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting it mixed up. Let me visualize. Cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, I think it's C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Oh wait, that's probably not right. Wait, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Propenal is CH2=CH-CHO. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond adjacent. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a CH2-CH2 group before the aldehyde? Or perhaps it's benzene ring with a CH2 group attached, then a double bond to another CH and then a CHO?

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Cinnamaldehyde has the structure where the benzene ring is connected to a CH2-CH2-CHO group? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a propenyl group attached to the aldehyde. So like Ph-CH2-CHO? No, no. Let me think again. Oh, wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. So its structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So the structure is benzene ring attached to a CH2=CH-CHO group. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CHO. No, I think I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Wait, no, that would be three carbons. Wait, wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? But wait, that's not a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with the structure where the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring via a propenyl group.

Let me look it up in my mind. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, derived from cinnamic acid. So its structure is benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Propenal is CH2=CH-CHO. So, the structure would be:

Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No
