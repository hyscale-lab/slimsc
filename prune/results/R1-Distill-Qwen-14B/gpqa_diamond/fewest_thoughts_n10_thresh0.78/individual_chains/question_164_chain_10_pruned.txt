Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. 

Spectroscopic observations show that in system_1, the two stars have radial velocity (RV) variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the components orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity curves are sinusoidal because each star's motion is circular (we can usually assume that for simplicity) around that center. The amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass ratio and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the formula involves Kepler's laws. The key here is probably the mass function or the relation between the velocities and the masses. Let me think. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is related to the mass of the other star and the total mass.

The formula I recall is K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars. But wait, that's when we have a certain inclination. But in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is about 1. So we can probably ignore that factor.

Alternatively, another approach is that the two stars orbit each other with velocities that are inversely proportional to their masses. So the more massive star moves slower. Because, from Newtonian mechanics, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So the velocity is proportional to (2πa)/P. So v1 = 2π a1 / P, and similarly for v2. Since a1 is proportional to M2/(M1 + M2), and a2 to M1/(M1 + M2), the velocities should be proportional to M2/(M_total) and M1/(M_total), respectively.

Wait, so if I let M1 and M2 be the masses of the two stars, then their velocities (v1 and v2) are proportional to M2 and M1, respectively. So v1/v2 = M2 / M1.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So v1 =10, v2=5. So v1/v2=2. So 2 = M2/M1. So M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 =3 M1. So M1 = (M1 + M2)/3. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait: M_total for system 1 is M1 + M2. But from the velocity ratio, v1/v2= M2
