Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts in electron-nuclear scattering. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitudes involve these phase shifts, and the imaginary part is related to those. Let me think through this.

So the question gives me phase shifts delta_0 =90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, delta_4=13 degrees. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond these. We need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, right, the scattering amplitude f(l, theta) is given by something involving the phase shifts. Oh yes, the formula is f_{l}(k, theta) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^L [ (e^{2i delta_l} - 1) * (something) ) ].

Alternatively, I think the general form is f(s, theta) = sum_{l} [ (e^{2i delta_l} -1) * ( (2i l +1)/(2k) ) * P_l(cos theta) ) ] where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, that's when integrating over all partial waves. But in this problem, we're considering the direction along the incident beam, which I think is theta=0 degrees.

Wait, the question says "along the incident beam direction." So that's the forward direction, so theta=0. So, in that case, for each l, P_l(cos 0) is P_l(1). And I remember that P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because at theta=0, the Legendre polynomial is 1.

So the scattering amplitude f(theta=0) would be the sum over l of (e^{2i delta_l} -1) * (something) * 1. The something is (2i l +1)/(2k), I think.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, I've heard that the total scattering amplitude is the sum of partial waves. So for each l, f_l contributes.

The formula for each partial wave is f_l(theta) = (e^{2i delta_l} -1) * ( (2i l + 1)/(2k) ) * P_l(cos theta) )
