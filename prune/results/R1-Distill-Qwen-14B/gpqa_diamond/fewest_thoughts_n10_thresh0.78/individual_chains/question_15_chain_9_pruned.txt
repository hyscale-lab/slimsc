Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Let me try to think through this.

First, the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They're both detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which is probably important.

So, orbital periods: Planet_1 has a shorter period. Specifically, it's three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. That would mean Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit, assuming similar stars.

Both have circular orbits, so no eccentricity to complicate things. That simplifies things a bit because the probability of transit might be easier to calculate without considering varying distances due to an elliptical path.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Usually, more massive stars are larger, but if they're the same radius, maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved? Or perhaps it's just a special case. But the question states that Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something. Anyway, their radii are the same, so R1 = R2.

The question is about transit probability. So transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But since we're observing both, I think we can assume that the alignment is the same, or that it doesn't affect the comparison between the two. Or maybe not? Hmm.

Wait, the RV method tells us the mass, but transit probability is about the inclination of the orbit. If a planet transits, its orbital plane's inclination is close to 90 degrees. The RV method is sensitive to planets with a range of inclinations, but for transit, you need i â‰ˆ 90. So for a planet detected via RV, the probability it transits is higher than for a random planet, because RV can detect planets that are not edge-on. Wait, no, RV detects planets regardless
