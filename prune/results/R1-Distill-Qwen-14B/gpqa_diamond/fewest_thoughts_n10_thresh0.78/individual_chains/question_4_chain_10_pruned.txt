Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe. Hmm, the question says that in this universe, a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, which is different from our real world where magnets always have both poles. So, how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, in our universe, one of Maxwell's equations states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism. So ∇·B = 0. But if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that must mean that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Because if there are monopoles, you can have regions where B is coming out (like a north pole) or going in (south pole), so the divergence would be non-zero. So that equation would change.

But wait, Maxwell's equations have four parts. Let me list them to be sure. The four are:

1. Gauss's Law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our world, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. But in this universe, if there are magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would change. Because equation 2 would now have a term related to the magnetic charge density. So instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be ∇·B = ρ_m / something, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

But the question is asking which equations are different. So equation 2 is definitely different. Are any others affected?

Wait, another thought. Maxwell's equations also include the other equations. If there are magnetic monopoles, do other equations change? Let's see equation 3, Faraday's Law. In our universe, it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if there are magnetic currents or something, maybe this equation would get a term involving the time derivative of the magnetic current. Or wait, if magnetic monopoles exist, then perhaps the time derivative of B would include a different term. Or maybe another term would appear in Faraday's Law.

Alternatively, maybe Ampère's Law (equation 4) would have a source term, similar to how Gauss's Law has a charge term. But in our case, Ampère's Law has the current density J, which comes from moving charges. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps there's a current density for magnetism, say K, that would appear in equation 4. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how that works.

Wait, in the real world, if you consider magnetic monopoles, you have to modify Maxwell's equations. One of the key modifications is that both Gauss's Law for B and Ampère's Law would change. Or wait, no, let me think again. Without magnetic monopoles, Ampère's Law is ∇×B =
