Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, ε is an energy constant, and n is a unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each being 2x2 matrices.

Wait, the dot product σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So, σ · n = n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and ε is just a scalar. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is their product. But wait, since this is a spin operator, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, another approach: any spin operator along a direction n has eigenvalues related to the spin component. For a spin-½ particle, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, right? Because σ · n is a spin operator scaled by something.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz each have eigenvalues ±1. So when you take a linear combination like σ · n, which is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n.

Wait, wait! Let me think again. The operator σ · n is a matrix, and when you multiply by ε, it scales the eigenvalues by ε. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ±ε.

But wait, wait a second. Let me confirm. The Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. For any unit vector n, the matrix σ · n has eigenvalues ±1 because it's a spin operator along that axis. Thus, when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε.

Wait, but wait again. I'm a bit confused because sometimes spin operators are written as (σ · n) multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right! The actual spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ · n. Because S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so H would have eigenvalues ± ε.

But let me think about the structure. The Pauli matrices satisfy σ_i^2 = I, so (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Expanding this, each σi^2 is I, and the cross terms σi σj + σj σi, which for i≠j is 2n_i n_j (because they anti-commute, so σi σj + σj σi = 2 δ_ij I). Wait, no, wait. Let me compute (σ · n)^2.

So (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2. Expanding this, each σi^2 is I, so n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I + cross terms. The cross terms are n_x n_y (σx σy + σy σx) + n_x n_z (σx σz + σz σx) + n_y n_z (σy σz + σz σy).

I remember that σi σj = i ε_ijk σk where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol, but when you have σi σj + σj σi, that equals 2 δ_ij I, because the anti-commutator {σi, σj} = 2 δ_ij I. So each cross term like σx σy + σy σx equals 2 I for x=y, but wait, no: when i≠j, {σi, σj} = 0. Wait, no, wait: the Pauli matrices anticommute when i≠j. So σi σj = - σj σi when i≠j. So σi σj + σj σi = 0 for i≠j. Oh wait, that changes things. So then:

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (σi σj + σj σi). But σi σj + σj σi = 0 when i≠j, because they anticommute. So the cross terms all vanish. Therefore, (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So (σ ·n)^2 = I.

So σ ·n is a matrix whose square is identity matrix. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n must be such that when squared, they equal 1. So possible eigenvalues are +1 and -1.

So then, the Hamiltonian H = ε (σ ·n) would have eigenvalues ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), so ±ε.

Looking back at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I thought I saw another approach where spin matrices have eigenvalues with ħ. Wait, maybe the problem defines σ as the Pauli matrices, which have eigenvalues ±1, so H = ε σ ·n would indeed have eigenvalues ±ε. Because the actual spin operator is (σ ·n) multiplied by ħ/2, but in this problem, H is ε multiplied by σ ·n.

So yeah, the eigenvalues are ±ε. So option B is correct.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \), and since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as this operator is a traceless Hermitian matrix whose square is the identity matrix, \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \).

When \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is multiplied by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scale accordingly. Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not \( \pm 1 \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \( \hbar/2 \) in this problem.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
