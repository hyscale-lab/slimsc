Okay, I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question has two parts, A and B. Each involves a reaction leading to a product, and I have to choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with reaction A: The compound is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. So, maybe an elimination or conjugate addition?

Wait, the structure of the starting material. The benzene ring has a substituent: (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let me draw that. The benzene is connected to a CH2 group, which is then connected to an oxygen. The oxygen is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. That group is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 2. So structure-wise, it's CH2-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond at position 2. Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the numbering is from the end. Hmm, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached via the first carbon. So the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is benzene-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-2-en-1-yl group is: CH2=CHCH2-. So the substituent is CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, more accurately: the group is (3-methylbut-2-en
