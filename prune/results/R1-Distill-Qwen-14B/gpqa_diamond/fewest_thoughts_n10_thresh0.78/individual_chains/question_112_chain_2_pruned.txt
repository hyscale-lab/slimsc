Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and jot down what I know.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. We also need to find the average value of this operator.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because the coefficients are complex numbers, I can't just take the square of their magnitudes yet. Let me write down the state.

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>

Wait, but it says it's proportional to this, so the actual state would be (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> multiplied by some normalization constant. Let me find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Compute the inner product:

<alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Wait, because |a|^2 = a * a*, right? So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2. Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 =4+1=5. So adding 2+5=7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the state is normalized now.

Next, I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. The operator A has
