Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC for short. The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question must be some heavy one. But wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think. Lithium (Li) typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the first step is to calculate gamma for v=0.96c. Let's compute that. 

v = 0.96c. So beta (β) is 0.96. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let's compute 1 - β². That would be 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. 

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 * 0.96 is indeed 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714. But maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so that's exact. So yes, gamma is 3.57142857 approximately.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². To find m, the mass of Li-6, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass. Let me think. Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6 g/mol. Wait, but I need the actual mass in kilograms. Alternatively, I can use the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u) and convert to kilograms. 

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 atomic mass units. Let me confirm that. I think the exact value is about 6.0151 u. One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27
