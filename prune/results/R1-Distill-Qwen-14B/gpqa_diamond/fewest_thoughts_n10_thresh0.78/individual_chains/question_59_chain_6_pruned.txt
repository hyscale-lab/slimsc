Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So, I should calculate the amounts of H+ and OH- ions in each solution and see what's left after they react.

Let's see, the problem gives me the volumes and concentrations of each solution. The first step is to compute the moles of each substance.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). Its concentration is 0.1 M and volume is 500 mL. Moles are concentration multiplied by volume in liters. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, when mixed with other things, maybe some reactions happen. I'll need to consider that.

Next is HCl, which is a strong acid. Its concentration is 0.2 M and volume 400 mL, which is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Its concentration is 0.3 M and volume 300 mL, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- here are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when mixing all these together, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

But first, I need to figure out the reaction between the acids and the base. H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so all its H+ will be available. Acetic acid is weak, so only a small amount will dissociate. However, in the solution, the presence of OH- will deprotonate some of the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with H+ from HCl first, and any remaining will react with acetic acid.

Wait, no. Maybe I should think in terms of moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH (but only partially). However, because HCl is strong, all 0.08 moles of HCl contribute 0.08 moles of H+. The acetic acid initially contributes some H+. But when OH- is present, it will neutralize H+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the net moles of H+ or OH- after all possible neutralizations.

So let's calculate the total H+ and OH- before any reactions.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: initially, it's a weak acid. Let's calculate the initial H+ from acetic acid without considering other solutions. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8e-5. The concentration in the mixed solution might change, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles.

Wait, but when we mix all the solutions, the concentrations change. So perhaps I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- first, then see what's left.

Total H+ initially (from HCl and CH3COOH) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't contribute as much H+ as HCl. But in the presence of OH-, it will react with any excess OH- after neutralization of HCl.

So first, let's neutralize the HCl with OH-.

HCl has 0.08 moles of H+. Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-. So H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

So 0.08 moles of H+ reacts with 0.08 moles of OH-, producing water. That leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

So after neutralizing HCl, we have excess OH- of 0.10 moles.

Now, what about the acetic acid? The 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. OH- will react with it. The
