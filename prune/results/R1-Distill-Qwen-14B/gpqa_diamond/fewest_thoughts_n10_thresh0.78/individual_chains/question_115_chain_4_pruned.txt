Okay, so I have this physics problem about particles annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, let's try to unpack it. 

So, an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma_e = 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right, and its Lorentz factor is 2. So gamma_p = 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. 

The energies of both photons are the same, and the directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between them. 

Wait, wait. Since the particles are annihilating, their rest mass energy will contribute to the photons. The electron and positron have the same mass, so each has rest mass energy of m*c², and when they annihilate, they produce energy in the form of photons. 

But wait, the photons have the same energy. So each photon's energy is half of the total energy from the annihilation. 

Hmm, but wait, the initial particles are moving, so their total energy isn't just their rest mass energy. They have kinetic energy as well. So I need to calculate their relativistic energies.

Electron's energy: gamma_e * m c². Positron's energy: gamma_p * m c². Because they're moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite.

So the total energy before collision is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c². But since they annihilate into photons, which have energy E1 and E2, with E1=E2. So each photon's energy is (gamma_e + gamma_p) m c² / 2.

Wait, but gamma factors: the electron is moving left, positron right, so their velocities are in opposite directions. So when they collide, their momenta are opposite. So the total momentum before collision is (gamma_e m v_e) - (gamma_p m v_p) because positron's velocity is opposite. Hmm, but wait, the positron is moving from the
