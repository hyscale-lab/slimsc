Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a reaction involving 1,5-dienes. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let me start by looking at part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw its structure to visualize it better.

So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl group. Wait, no, the structure is OCH2 connected to the benzene, and the oxygen is also connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me break it down.

The main chain is OCH2Ph (where Ph is the benzene ring). The oxygen is connected to a butenyl group: but-2-en-1-yl. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-CH2-Ph. Wait, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but with substituents. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be:

The butenyl group is four carbons. The double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituent is methyl on C3. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, butenyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, the numbering is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituent is on C3. Oh wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the structure is Ph-O-
