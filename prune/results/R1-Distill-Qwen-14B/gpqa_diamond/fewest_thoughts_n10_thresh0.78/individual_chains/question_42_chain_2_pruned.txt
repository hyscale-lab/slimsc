Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I don't think that method affects this particular problem, so maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 is 1.4. Then, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So T2/T3 is 2.3. Wait, wait, so if T1/T2 is 1.4, then T2 is T1 /1.4. And T2/T3 is 2.3, so T3 is T2 /2.3. So substituting, T3 = (T1/1.4)/2.3 = T1/(1.4*2.3). Let me calculate that: 1.4 *2.3 is 3.22, so T3 is T1 /3.22. So the equilibrium temperatures are T1, T2 = T1/1.4, and T3 = T1/3.22.

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²)]^0.25, where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance. Alternatively, I've also seen it written as T ∝ sqrt( (L (1 - a)) / D^2 ). Because the albedo is the same for all three planets, and assuming they orbit the same star (so L is same), the temperature ratio should be proportional to the inverse square root of the distance ratio. So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). Because if D is larger, the planet is farther and thus cooler.

So
