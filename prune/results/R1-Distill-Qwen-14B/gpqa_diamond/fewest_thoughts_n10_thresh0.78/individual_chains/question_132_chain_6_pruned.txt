Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic NMR, but I'll try.

The question says we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR has two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, C10H14. Let me see. The molecular formula for tetramethylbenzenes would be C8H10 each, but wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is C1H3. So 4 methyl groups would be 4*C (so C4) and 12 H. So C6 + C4 = C10? Oh wait, wait. No, wait: C6 (benzene) plus 4 methyl groups (each is C1) would be C6 +4= C10. And H: benzene has 6 H. Each methyl adds 3 H, so 4*3=12. 6+12=18. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's different. So maybe each compound is C10H14? Or wait, no, the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds, each with C10H14. So each compound has the same formula.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe each is a diethyl something. The options include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be ethyl groups attached to benzene. So each ethyl is C2H5. Two ethyl groups would give C4 (2*2) and H10 (2*5). So benzene (C6H6) plus two ethyl groups: C6+4 = C10, H6 +10 = H16. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula for each option. Let's take each compound:

The options are:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: so four methyl groups on the benzene. Benzene is C6H6. Four methyl groups: 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So total C6+4= C10, H6+12= H18. So formula is C10H18. But the problem says each compound is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the compounds are not tetramethyl, but something else.

Wait, wait, perhaps 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl is C2H5. Two ethyl groups: C4H10. Benzene is C6H6. So total is C6+4= C10, H6+10= H16. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, discrepancy. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the problem statement says the mixture is C10H14 in total? No, wait, the question says the solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. So each compound must be C10H14. So each of the two compounds in the mixture has the formula C10H14.

So let's reevaluate. Let's think about the possible structures.

The options are:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: formula is C10H14
