Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The shape of the aperture affects where these maxima and minima occur. For a single slit, I know the minima occur at angles where a sinθ = λ m, where m is an integer. But wait, this isn't a single slit; it's a polygon with N sides. Oh, but wait, the problem says N is infinitely large. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with many sides approximates a circle. So maybe this is similar to a circular aperture's diffraction pattern, but wait, the question says the apothems are all the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, so for a regular polygon, that's like the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N is huge, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Wait, no—no, wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to the middle of a side, so the radius of the circumscribed circle (the actual distance from center to a vertex) would be longer than a. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, when N is large, the aperture approaches a circle of radius a. So perhaps the diffraction pattern
