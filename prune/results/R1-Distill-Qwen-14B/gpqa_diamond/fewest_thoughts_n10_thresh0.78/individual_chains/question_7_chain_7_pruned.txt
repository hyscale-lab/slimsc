Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about cosmic gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process. The average CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so it's definitely a high-energy scenario.

Hmm, I remember that pair production from gamma-gamma collisions is an important process in cosmology. The key here is probably to calculate the cross-section and then use it to find the interaction length or lifetime.

Wait, the process is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. So each gamma-ray photon can annihilate with a CMB photon. The cross-section for this process increases with the center-of-mass energy. But the CMB photons are low-energy, 1e-3 eV on average.

Let me think about the typical approach. The lifetime of a particle is determined by its interaction rate. If the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, it means the annihilation happens quickly enough that the gamma can't survive longer than the age of the universe, or something like that.

The annihilation cross-section depends on the energy of the gamma-ray. I think the cross-section for this process peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around the electron mass, but wait, no, electrons are much lighter than the gamma-rays here. Oh wait, no, in pair production, the threshold is when the combined energy is at least twice the electron mass. Since the CMB photon is low energy, the gamma-ray needs enough energy such that when they collide, their combined energy is enough to produce the pair.

Wait, the threshold condition for pair production (gamma + photon -> e+ e-) is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least equal to twice the electron rest mass. The electron rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 times that is around 1.022 MeV. But in this case, the CMB photon's energy is much lower than that. So the gamma-ray must have enough energy to, when combined with a low-energy CMB photon, reach a center-of-mass energy above that threshold.

Wait, but the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, so the energy in the center-of-mass frame depends on both photon energies and their relative momenta. Hmm, maybe I should consider the condition for when the process becomes possible.

The threshold condition for pair production in gamma-photon collisions is when the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame equals the square of the electron mass. Let me write the formula for that.

In the lab frame, assuming the CMB photon is at rest, but wait no, photons are massless and move at speed c. Maybe it's better to use the invariant s, the square of the total four-momentum.

The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Since both are photons, their energies E1 and E2 are equal to their momenta times c (because for photons, E = pc). So E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c.

Assuming
