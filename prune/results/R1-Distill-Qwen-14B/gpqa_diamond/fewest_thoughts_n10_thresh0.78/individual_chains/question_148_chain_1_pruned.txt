Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. Let me break down the information given.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20Â°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. The decomposition releases F2, which suggests that A1 might be a fluorinated compound that can lose F- or something. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 probably means A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon, and it's obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y is the other element in these compounds. When Y is fluorinated, it forms A3, which is a binary compound of F and Y. Maybe A3 is YF3 or YF7 or something like that.

Moving on, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, it produces A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. The question is about the molecular weight (molar mass) of A4, which is one of the binary compounds of F and Y.

I need to figure out what Y is. Let's think about elements that form multiple binary fluorides. I remember that halogens like Cl, Br, I form several, but Y is probably not a halogen because fluorine is already the halogen here. Alternatively, elements like oxygen or sulfur? Wait, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but I'm not sure how many binary fluorides they have.

Wait, another thought. Xenon is a noble gas, and if A1 and A3 can oxidize it, they must be strong oxidizing agents. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but so are some of its compounds. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. Alternatively, looking
