Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to calculate the total bond energies of all the bonds in the compound and then relate that to the elements (like carbon and hydrogen) using the given bond energies.

The problem gives me some data: the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break a bond in an element to produce gaseous atoms. So for carbon, each C-C bond would require 1000 kJ to break into two C atoms?

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. The formula I remember is: ΔH°f = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, the correct formula is the sum of the bond energies of the products minus the sum of the reactants,
