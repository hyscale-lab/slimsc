Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the correct reagents A and B from the options given. 

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of addition. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is providing the cyanide ion, which is a nucleophile. So in the presence of an acid catalyst, perhaps?

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN- under acidic conditions, what happens? Oh right! It's the aldol addition. Wait, no, wait. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. That's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Or wait, no, the structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be CH2CN-C(OH)(CH2CH3) or wait, let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons, but the hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH2CH3)-CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is HOCH2-C(CH3)-CN? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutane nitrile. So the molecule would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on carbon 4. Oh wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN, which is 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.
