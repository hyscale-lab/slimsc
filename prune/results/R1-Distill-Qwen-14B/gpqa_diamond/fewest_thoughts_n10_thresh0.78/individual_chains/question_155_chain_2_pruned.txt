Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

Wait, right. The formula for uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of ( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to calculate both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

But wait, the state the system is in is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Oh, that's important. So the state vector provided is already in the P_z basis. That should make things easier because I don't have to change bases or anything.

So the state given is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote it as |ψ> = [ -1/2 , 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, I need to compute <P_z>, the expectation value of P_z. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, no, more precisely, each component of the state corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Let me see the matrix of P_z. The matrix is given as diagonal entries: first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row is (0,0,0), third row is (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the three basis states, respectively. Let's denote the basis vectors as |1>, |2>, |3>, corresponding to these eigenvalues.

The state |ψ> is a linear combination of these basis vectors. The coefficients are the components of the vector. So |ψ> = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>.

So the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the
