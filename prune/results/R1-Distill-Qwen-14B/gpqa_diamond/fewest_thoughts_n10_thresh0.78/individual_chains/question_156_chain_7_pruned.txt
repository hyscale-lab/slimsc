Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again.

So, the problem is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. So, both E and Z oct-4-ene will react with mCPBA to form epoxides.

Wait, but wait. The starting materials are E and Z isomers. When they react with mCPBA, which is an electrophilic oxidizing agent, the reaction forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the structure of the epoxide.

I think that the reaction of mCPBA with alkenes typically proceeds via an electrocyclic opening, but wait, no, that's for different conditions. Oh, right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide. The geometry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide.

Wait, what's the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene? Both are 4-octene, but E is trans and Z is cis. So, the double bond is between C4 and C5, with substituents on either end.

When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it forms an epoxide. Now, I think that when the alkene is treated with mCPBA, the endo transition state leads to the formation of the epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, when mCPBA adds, the oxygen will form an ep
