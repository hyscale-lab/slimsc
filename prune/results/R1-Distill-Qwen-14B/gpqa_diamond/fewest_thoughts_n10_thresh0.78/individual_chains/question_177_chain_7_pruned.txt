Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that for black bodies, the peak wavelength of emission is related to their temperature by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says lambda_max ≈ constant / T, where T is the temperature in Kelvin. The constant is about 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K. So, if two stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities—how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, this is the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if moving away, it's redshifted (longer wavelength). The formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is delta_lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative based on direction. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its emitted wavelength is exactly lambda_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Since it's moving towards us or away?

Wait, the question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. So if Star_2's radial velocity is positive 700 km/s, that might mean it's moving towards us, causing a blueshift. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the formula is lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (c + v)/ (c - v) ) ) or something like that. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps for this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So the question states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So their observed lambda_max is the same.

But since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, its emitted lambda_max is the same as observed. Star_2, with a velocity of 700 km/s, must have its emitted lambda_max shifted to match the observed. Wait, but does that affect the actual temperature? Because the star's temperature determines its emitted peak wavelength; the observed peak is shifted based on velocity.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So when we observe them, their lambda_max is the same. So for Star_1, since it's not moving, its emitted lambda_max is the same as observed. Star_2 has a radial velocity, so its emitted lambda_max must have been shifted to match the observed. So the actual temperatures of the stars might be different, because their emitted lambda_max would differ, but due to Doppler shift, their observed lambda_max is the same.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, for Star_1: observed lambda_max equals emitted lambda_max. So T1 = (constant / lambda_max_observed). For Star_2: observed lambda_max is same, but emitted lambda_max is different because of the velocity. So T2 is (constant / lambda_emitted_2), but lambda_emitted_2 is shifted by the Doppler effect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength. The formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving with velocity v (assuming v is much less than c, which it is) is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) )

Wait, no, maybe it's (1 + v/c) for redshift when moving away. Or wait, for a star moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted, so blueshifted. So if the star is moving towards us at speed v, the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (c - v)/(c + v), perhaps? Hmm, maybe I should get the exact formula.

Wait, I think the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

where beta is v/c, and v is the radial velocity. But I'm not entirely sure about the direction—like, if the source is moving away, beta is positive, so the observed wavelength is longer. So for Star_2, with radial velocity 700 km/s, but which direction? The question just says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. I'm not sure if it's moving towards or away. The problem says they have the same observed lambda_max, so perhaps Star_2's observed lambda is the same as Star_1's, but it's moving, so its emitted lambda_max is different.

So let's model it.

Let me denote:
- For Star_1: v1 = 0, so lambda1_obs = lambda1_emit.
- For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away, so v is positive. Then, lambda2_obs = lambda2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), where beta = v/c.

But wait, the observed lambda_max is same for both stars. So lambda1_obs = lambda2_obs = lambda_obs.

Thus,

lambda1_emit = lambda_obs.

lambda2_emit = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Because when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the emitted wavelength would be shorter than the observed.

So let me calculate beta. v = 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s.

So beta = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = approx 0.002333...

So sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) is sqrt( (1 - 0.002333)/(1 + 0.002333) )

Calculate numerator: 1 - 0.002333 ≈ 0.997667

Denominator: 1.002333

So (0.997667)/(1.002333) ≈ approximately 0.99534.

Then sqrt( that ) is sqrt(0.99534) ≈ about 0.99767.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (1 - beta) = 0.9976666667

(1 + beta) = 1.0023333333

Divide: 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333

Let me compute that.

Approximating numerator as 0.9976666667 ≈ 997666.6667e-6

Denominator: 1.0023333333≈ 1002333.3333e-6

So 997666.6667 / 1002333.3333 ≈ (997666.6667) / (1002333.3333) = approx 0.99534.

So the square root of that is sqrt(0.99534) ≈ 0.997668.

So lambda2_emit = lambda_obs * 0.99766
