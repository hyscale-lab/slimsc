Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key here is understanding the brightness limits of each instrument.

From the question, I gather that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17.0 mag, meaning it can see stars up to a certain apparent magnitude. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16.0 mag. So, the stars need to be within both of these limits to be detected by both. Wait, but actually, wait: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO, and "brighter than 16 V mag" for HIRES. So, ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, and HIRES up to 16 mag. So any star that's less than or equal to 16 mag would be detectable by both, because 16 is the lower limit of the higher brightness (since lower magnitudes are brighter). Wait, no, wait: higher magnitude means fainter. So, if a star is brighter (lower magnitude), it's within both. But if a star is fainter, say 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't because HIRES only goes up to 16. So the stars that are detectable by both must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So, which stars have apparent V magnitudes ≤16?

Wait, but looking at the options, some stars have absolute magnitudes and distances given, so we might need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude (mv) is mv = Mv + 5 log10(d) -5. So d is 10, log10(10) is 1. So mv
