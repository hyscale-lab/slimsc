Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let's see. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a bit of a mouthful. I think it's a diene or something similar because I see double bonds here and there.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can sometimes be calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is equal to the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the reactants (like elements in their standard states) minus the sum of the bond energies in the product molecule. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Actually, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is the energy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But using bond energies, we can calculate it by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

Wait, no, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula is ΔHf = [sum of bond energies in reactants] - [sum of bond energies in products]. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite? Because when you form products, you're releasing energy if bonds are formed. So if the reactants are elements, which have single bonds
