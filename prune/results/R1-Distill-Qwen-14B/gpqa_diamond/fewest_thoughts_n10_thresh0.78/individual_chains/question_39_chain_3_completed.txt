Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position of the particles, they only find them between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, I think. Wait, but the wave function can't just be zero everywhere else; it should have a certain form that ensures the particle's probability is zero outside 1 to 3.

Wait, no, the wave function as given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that seems a bit odd. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but for a stationary state, perhaps it's a product of a spatial part and a time-dependent exponential. But maybe that's not the point here. The key point is that when measuring x, they only find particles between 1 and 3. So that probably means the wave function must be zero outside that interval. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that doesn't look like something that would be zero except perhaps at specific points. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the real and imaginary parts. Because the wave function usually has a real and an imaginary component.

Wait, but the wave function in the problem is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. Let me write that as ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|² must be finite. Also, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function is a function of x, but it doesn't look like a function that's zero outside 1 and 3. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the wave function as given is only valid between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the expression given is the form within that region.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased says that when measuring, none were found x<1 and x>3. So the wave function's probability is zero outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that, but for x between 1 and 3, it's given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that's a problem because (a / sqrt(1+x)) is a real number if a is real, but the given function has a real part plus an imaginary part. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is actually a product of a spatial part and a time-dependent part. But in the problem statement, it's specified that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is given as that expression. So maybe the spatial part is the real function, and the imaginary part is due to the time-dependent exponential, like e^{-iEt/ħ} or something. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function given is a real function plus an imaginary constant. But that might complicate normalization. Wait, the wave function must satisfy the condition that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infinity to infinity equals 1. Since the particle is only found between 1 and 3, the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx must equal 1. 

So let's write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Then |ψ(x)|² is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2 ], since the real and imaginary parts are squared and added. So |ψ(x)|² = [ a²/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ].

We need to integrate this from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is supposed to be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So actually, the wave function is zero for x<1 and x>3. So when we integrate the probability density, it's only over x=1 to x=3. So the integral is from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because a²/(1+x) plus 0.25 is always positive, so integrating that would give a sum that's larger than 0.25*(2) = 0.5, since the interval is 2 units long. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by a function that's zero outside 1 to 3. So the actual wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) * θ(x-1) * [1 - θ(x-3)], where θ is the Heaviside step function. But the problem states that the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i within the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is that expression only in that interval and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function can't have an imaginary part unless it's a stationary state with a time-dependent exponential factor. But in this case, perhaps the imaginary part is part of the spatial wave function, which suggests that the wave function is not properly normalized unless the imaginary part is zero. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the given wave function.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the imaginary part. Because in the problem statement, each particle's wave function in the part where it can exist is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps it's a complex function, but the square of the modulus would include both real and imaginary parts. But integrating that might complicate normalization unless the imaginary part is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the wave function has an imaginary part, then the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Because (a/sqrt(1+x) )^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i)^2 is (0.25)*(-i)^2 = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. Wait, no, wait. Actually, when you compute |ψ|², you take the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared. So ψ = Re + i Im. So |ψ|² = Re^2 + Im^2.

In this case, ψ has real part a/sqrt(1+x), and imaginary part -0.5. So the magnitude squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

Let's split it into two integrals:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first integral is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

Adding them: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute the value: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral setup. Did I miss any part?

The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we square the modulus, it's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25, correct. The integral from 1 to3 is of this. So that's a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

Yes, that seems correct. So a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.7213 → a≈0.85.

So the correct option is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \text{Re}[\psi(x)]^2 + \text{Im}[\psi(x)]^2 \). Substituting the given wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first integral is \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
\]

Combining the two results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
