Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out each step of the reaction to understand what product 3 is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, especially when there are two adjacent bromides. So probably an E2 elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, but what's the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Adamantane has a structure that's similar to a diamond, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, so when KOH is added, they should eliminate to form an alkene. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, if it's elimination, why is there a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe I got the first reaction wrong.

Wait, when dibromides react with KOH, they can undergo elimination to form alkenes, but sometimes if it's a vicinal dihalide (like adjacent bromines), elimination would give an alkene. Alternatively, if it's a 1,3-dibromide, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene? Or maybe if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the elimination would lead to a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Wait, but if the product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, that suggests a ketone or ester or something with a C=O group. So perhaps elimination didn't happen but instead a substitution occurred. Oh, wait, KOH could also do a substitution. But 1,3-dibromides are usually less reactive towards substitution, especially with two leaving groups, but maybe in this case, a substitution occurs, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl via elimination, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, another thought: when di bromides are treated with KOH, sometimes they can form epoxides if the bromines are on adjacent carbons. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on non-adjacent bridgehead positions, so that might not form an epoxide. Alternatively, perhaps they eliminate to form a ketone via some kind of elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. The product has a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ring-opening forming a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to a double bond, and the other bromide leaves, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hof
