Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem involves two reactions, and I need to figure out what products are formed, and then determine how many peaks each would show up on different HPLC columns. Let's take it one reaction at a time.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones. So, the starting material is a ketone. Let me draw the structure. 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, the structure is: CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, position 5 from the ketone is the second carbon from the end. Wait, maybe it's better to number it.

Hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6.

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3

Wait, no. Wait, wait. 3-one is on carbon 3 of a six-carbon chain. So, structure would be: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, perhaps another way. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me write it.

Structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3

Wait, no, wait. The name is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the longest chain is six carbons, with the ketone on carbon 3, and a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, positions:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: OCH3 attached to which carbon? Wait,
