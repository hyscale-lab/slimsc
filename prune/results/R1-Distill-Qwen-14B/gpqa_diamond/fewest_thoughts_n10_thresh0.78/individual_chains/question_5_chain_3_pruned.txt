Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators (like P here, maybe spin?) have components that can be combined to find the operator along any direction.

Wait, the operator isn't spin but let me think. The components given are P_x, P_y, P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, P must be a 2x2 matrix operator, probably representing spin-½ in some direction. Because for spin-½ particles, the components are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So yes, P is the spin operator here.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. That means the direction has components in x and z, but not y. So the angle θ is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, I think. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane.

The operator P along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's components. So P = (P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z). But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n_x is sinθ and n_z is cosθ, right? So P = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Each of these P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices. Let me write them out.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting in, P becomes:

P = (sinθ) * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ) * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (
