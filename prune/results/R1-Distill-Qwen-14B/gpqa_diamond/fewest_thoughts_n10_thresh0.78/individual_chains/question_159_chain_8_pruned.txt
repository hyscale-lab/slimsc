Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar and its spectrum, and I need to figure out the comoving distance from Earth. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that signify? Oh right, I think that might be related to the Lyman-alpha forest or something about redshift. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet for hydrogen, but if it's observed at 790 nm, that's longer than 91 nm (the rest wavelength), so the quasar must be redshifted. 

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that's a redshift. The formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) -1. So 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.49. Wait wait, wait—wait, that can't be right. Because 121.6 nm is the rest, so observed longer implies higher z. Let me compute it: 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.498. So z is about 6.498, so roughly z = 6.5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct line. Because sometimes in quasars, the emission lines can be broad or from other elements. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman limit? Lyman limit is 91.2 nm, so if observed at 790, then z would be (790)/(91.2) ≈8.66. Hmm, but I'm not certain if that's what's being referred here. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series, like H-alpha, but that's in the optical. Oh wait, the peak in near-infrared—maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line redshifted into the infrared? Because quasars often have strong emission lines.

Wait, but the question mentions that the flux drops for wavelengths shorter than 790 nm. That might mean that beyond 790 nm (longer), the flux is higher, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the Lyman break? Oh right, the Lyman break is where the flux drops because the intergalactic medium (IGM) absorbs light below a certain wavelength. So if the quasar's rest-frame UV emission is cut off at Lyman limit (91.2 nm), then when observed at 790 nm, this would imply a redshift z such that 91.2*(1+z) = 790. So z = (790/91.2) -1 ≈ 8.67. So z≈8.67.

Wait, but wait. The Lyman break is when the IGM at high redshifts (like the epoch of reionization) causes the absorption of wavelengths below 91.2(1+z) nm. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, that would be the Lyman break. So the quasar's rest frame UV emission is cut off at 91.2 nm, and when observed, it's at 790 nm. So z is (790/91.2) -1 ≈ 8.67.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The Lyman break is the point where the IGM absorbs light below 91.2*(1+z) nm. So for a quasar at redshift z, its rest UV emission is cut off at 91.2 nm. So when we observe it, that cutoff is at 91.2 * (1+z). So if the peak is at 790, which is the cutoff, then yes, 91.2*(1+z)=790 → z ≈8.67. 

So the quasar is at a redshift of about 8.67. Now, the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1 (which is now). The comoving distance is given by the integral of c/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the comoving distance for a given redshift z is given by the integral from a=0 to a=1/(1+z) of c/H(a) da. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the comoving distance D_C is given by D_C = (c/H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Because for a flat universe, curvature is zero, so Ω_k=0, and
