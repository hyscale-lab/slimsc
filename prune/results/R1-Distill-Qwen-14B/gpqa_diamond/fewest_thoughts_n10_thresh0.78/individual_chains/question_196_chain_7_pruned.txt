Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I'm a bit confused between the relativistic and the classical cases. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, right? So for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Equating them gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that approach directly.

In relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's total energy. The total energy should include both kinetic and potential contributions. But wait, harmonic oscillators have potential energy that's a function of position, and their motion is periodic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the equations are more complicated. The oscillator's equation of motion isn't the same as the classical one. I remember that for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is adjusted to account for relativistic effects. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)kA² is the total energy at maximum displacement, which is all potential. At maximum speed (when x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy at maximum displacement should be the sum of the rest energy and potential energy, but wait, the potential energy in relativity might be different. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in this relativistic oscillator is the same as the classical one, (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So at the maximum displacement, all the energy is potential, and at
