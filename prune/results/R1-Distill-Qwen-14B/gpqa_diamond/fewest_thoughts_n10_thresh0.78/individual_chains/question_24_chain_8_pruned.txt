Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'll take it slowly because I don't want to miss anything.

Alright, the problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids decolorize bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So mixture X must have two compounds with double bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction that forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever happened during the reaction probably removed the double bonds. Oh,铂作为催化剂，加热条件下，这可能是一个加成反应。比如，双键打开，加成氢之类的反应，比如加氢反应。那这样，Y中的物质可能已经加氢，使得它们的结构中没有了双键，所以不能和溴水反应了。

The problem also states that when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they only give one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Plus, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Oh, right, a common solvent is probably something like toluene or something else. Wait, no, let me think. Let's compute the mass fraction first.

So, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's denote the molecular formula of Z as C_nH_m. The mass fraction is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428. Let me compute that. 0.1428 is roughly 1/7, since 1/7 is approximately 0.142857. So maybe the fraction is 1/7.

So (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7. Cross multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. Now, which hydrocarbons fit that? Oh, that's the general formula for alkenes, but wait, if Z doesn't have any further reaction with hydrogen, it must be a saturated compound. Oh wait, because if it were an alkene, then hydrogenation under severe conditions would further hydrogenate it. But the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So that suggests that Z is fully saturated. Hmmm, but wait, the formula CnH2n is for alkenes, which are unsaturated. Wait, but if Z is a constituent of Y, which is after the first hydrogenation, perhaps Z is an alkane? Wait, I might be getting confused.

Let me recheck. Z is formed when both X and Y are hydrogenated. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of two other compounds (maybe cycloalkanes or something else), then both are hydrogenated to give Z. So maybe X and Y are each mixtures that upon hydrogenation give the same Z.

Wait, another thought: If X had two alkenes, then Y after some reaction might have something else, but both when fully hydrogenated give the same Z. So perhaps Z is an alkane.

Wait, but the formula CnH2n is alkene formula, but if Z is an alkane, then the formula would be CnH2n+2. Let me compute that again.

Wait, the mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me set it up again:

Hydrogen's mass fraction = (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. So Z is a compound with H2n. That would make it like an alkene, but that can't be right because Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, implying it's saturated.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Hydrogen mass is m * 1.008 g/mol (approx 1 for simplicity). The molecular mass is 12n + m.

Fraction: (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 0.1428 → 0.1428 = m/(12n + m)

Cross multiply: 0.1428
