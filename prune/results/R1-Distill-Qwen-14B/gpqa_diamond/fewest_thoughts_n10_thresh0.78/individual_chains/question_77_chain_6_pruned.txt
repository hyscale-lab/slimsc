Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and it's about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. So, when a molecule with a conjugated diene in a 1,5-diene structure is heated or exposed to light, it rearranges. The rearrangement shifts the double bonds, leading to a different structure.

The problem gives two reactions and asks me to select the major products A and B from the options provided. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first reaction:

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw its structure mentally. Benzene ring with a substituent group. The substituent is an oxy group (O) attached to a methyl group (CH2O), and then another group attached to that oxygen. The other group is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So, that would be a four-carbon chain: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-, but wait, the double bond is at position 2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-Ph? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-(CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2). Wait, no, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but wait, but it's 3-methyl. So, structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but with a methyl branch at position 3. Wait, position numbering. Let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is
