Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each suggesting a different power law relationship.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So, if a star has a parallax of 1 parsec, it's 1 parsec away. Wait, no, wait: actually, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Let me think about the distribution of stars in the universe. Stars are spread out in all directions, right? So, the number of stars we observe depends on how many are located at different distances.

But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So when parallax is small, the star is far away. When parallax is large, the star is nearby. But how does the number of stars in a given parallax range change with plx?

Wait, I think I need to consider the volume of space at a certain distance. The number of stars in a volume depends on that volume. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should be proportional to the volume.

The volume of a spherical shell (like a thin layer) at distance d with thickness dr is given by 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in a small shell would be proportional to d² dr. But since parallax plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So substituting d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But wait, we're looking at the number per unit plx. Let me think about how the parallax relates to the distance. If we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Parallax is inversely proportional, so when plx increases, distance decreases. So a small change in plx (dplx) corresponds to a change in distance. Let me express this properly. Let's say we have a parallax plx, so the distance is d = 1/plx. The next parallax is plx + dplx, so the distance is d' = 1/(plx
