Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c = 1.

Hmm, right. So, the setup is that the glass is moving, and the light is going through it. We need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab frame.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Usually, you use the velocity addition formulas. But wait, is that applicable here? Because the glass is moving and the light is in the same medium. Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the moving glass. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is different. Oh, right, because the medium (glass) has an index of refraction, so the speed of light inside is v_light = c/n. But wait, that's when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. Here, the medium is moving.

Wait, but wait a second. From the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. So, the light is moving within a moving medium. But does the speed of light in the moving medium change? Or does the fact that the medium is moving affect the observed speed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the motion of the source or observer. But here, the medium itself is moving. So, when the medium is moving, how does that affect the light's speed in that medium?

Hmm. I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can be affected because the medium's motion can influence the refractive index or the way the light propagates. Oh, but wait, the refractive index is a property of the material, right? So if the glass is moving, does that change the refractive index? Or does the refractive index remain the same as measured in the glass's rest frame?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the light
