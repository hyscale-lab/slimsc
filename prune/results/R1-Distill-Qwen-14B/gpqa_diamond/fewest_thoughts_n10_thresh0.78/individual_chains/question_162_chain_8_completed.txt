Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric in terms of x and y. But wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? It's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere.

Wait, actually, wait. The term "pseudosphere" sometimes refers to a specific type of surface, but in the context of general relativity, it's a surface with constant curvature. Since it's called a pseudosphere, I'm guessing it's of negative curvature, which would make it have a "saddle" shape.

But wait, another thought. The metric given is in 2D because it's only in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a 2D surface. But a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, so that makes sense.

Hmm, I remember that the Gaussian curvature K is related to the metric. For a metric in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula involving the determinant of the second derivatives or something like that. Alternatively, if the metric is conformally flat, like this one is, because it's written as f(x,y)(dx² + dy²), where f is a function.

Wait, yes, conformally flat metrics have the form ds² = e^{2φ} (dx² + dy²), but in this case, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the function is (32)/(4 - x² - y²). So maybe we can find the Gaussian curvature from that.

I remember that for a conformally flat metric, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2φ})) * [Δφ + ( ( ∇φ )² ) ]

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly. Alternatively, another approach: for a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - [ ( ∂² ln g / ∂x² + ∂² ln g / ∂y² ) / 2 ] 

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the general formula for Gaussian curvature for a metric in isothermal coordinates, which is the case here because the metric is conformally flat.

Alternatively, I remember that for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), which is in polar coordinates, the Gaussian curvature K is - (1/(2 f^2)) [ (d² f)/(dr²) + (1/r) (df/dr) ) ].

Wait, but in our case, it's in Cartesian coordinates. Let me think again. Since the metric is conformally flat, the Gaussian curvature can be calculated using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 g)) * ( ∂²g/∂x² + ∂²g/∂y² )

where g is the conformal function. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, another approach. The Gaussian curvature K for a 2D metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is given by:

K = - (1/(4 g)) [ ( ∂x ( ∂g/∂x ) + ∂y ( ∂g/∂y ) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should look for a more precise formula. Alternatively, I remember that the Gaussian curvature in terms of the conformal factor f(x,y) is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f)) [ (f_{xx} + f_{yy}) ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature using that.

Wait, let me think: the function f here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me compute f_xx and f_yy.

Wait, f(x,y) = 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32 * (4 - x² - y²)^(-1)

So the first derivative with respect to x is f_x = 32 * (-1) * (-2x) * (4 - x² - y²)^(-2) = (64 x) / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Similarly, the second derivative f_xx is the derivative of (64x)/(denominator^2). Let me compute that.

Denominator D = (4 - x² - y²), so D² = (4 - x² - y²)^2.

d/dx [64x / D^2] = [64 * D^2 - 64x * 2 D * (-2x)] / D^4.

Wait, that's using the quotient rule: derivative of numerator times denominator minus numerator times derivative of denominator, all over denominator squared.

Wait, more accurately:

f(x) = 64x * (D)^(-2)

f_xx = derivative of that with respect to x.

So:

d/dx [64x * D^(-2)] = 64 * D^(-2) + 64x * (-2) D^(-3) * (-2x)

Because derivative of D is dD/dx = -2x.

So:

f_xx = 64/(D²) + 64x * (2x) / D^3.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First term: derivative of 64x is 64, times D^(-2) → 64/(D^2).

Second term: 64x times derivative of D^(-2) → 64x * (-2)* D^(-3) * dD/dx.

But dD/dx is -2x, so:

= 64x * (-2) * D^(-3) * (-2x)
= 64x * (4x) / D^3
= 256 x² / D^3.

So f_xx = 64/(D^2) + 256 x² / D^3.

Similarly, f_yy would be the same, but replacing x with y.

So f_yy = 64/(D^2) + 256 y² / D^3.

So f_xx + f_yy = [64/D² + 64/D² ] + [256 x²/D^3 + 256 y²/D^3]

= 128/(D²) + 256 (x² + y²) / D^3.

Wait, but D is (4 - x² - y²), so x² + y² = 4 - D.

So substituting that in, x² + y² = 4 - D.

So f_xx + f_yy = 128/(D²) + 256 (4 - D) / D^3.

= 128/(D²) + [256 *4 - 256 D ] / D^3
= 128/D² + (1024 / D^3) - 256/(D^2).

Wait, let's compute each term:

256(4 - D)/D^3 = (1024 - 256 D ) / D^3.

So f_xx + f_yy = 128/D² + (1024 - 256 D ) / D^3.

Hmmm, let's combine these terms.

128/D² = (128 D ) / D^3.

So:

(128 D + 1024 - 256 D ) / D^3 = [ (128 D - 256 D ) + 1024 ] / D^3.

= [ (-128 D) + 1024 ] / D^3.

Factor out 128: 128 (-D + 8) / D^3.

Wait, but D = 4 - x² - y², so 8 is much larger than D, but perhaps I should see if this simplifies correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

Hmm, 256(4 - D) is 1024 - 256 D.

So when adding 128/D² (which is 128 D / D^3 ), we have:

128 D / D^3 + 1024 / D^3 - 256 D / D^3.

So combining terms:

(128 D - 256 D) = -128 D.

So numerator becomes (-128 D + 1024 ) / D^3.

But D is 4 - (x² + y²). So perhaps this can be written as:

= [ -128(4 - x² - y²) + 1024 ] / D^3.

= [ -512 + 128 x² + 128 y^2 + 1024 ] / D^3.

Wait, 1024 - 512 = 512.

So numerator is 512 + 128(x² + y²).

Which can be written as 128 (4 + x² + y²) ).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute:

-128*(4 - x² - y²) = -512 + 128 x² + 128 y².

Adding 1024 gives (-512 + 1024 ) + 128 x² + 128 y² = 512 + 128(x² + y²).

So numerator is 512 + 128(x² + y²) = 128(4 + x² + y²).

Hmm, so f_xx + f_yy = [128 (4 + x² + y^2)] / D^3.

Because D^3 is (4 - x² - y²)^3.

So then, the expression for f_xx + f_yy is [128 (4 + x² + y²)] / (4 - x² - y²)^3.

Wait, but let me go back to the formula for Gaussian curvature. I think earlier I was trying to compute it as K = - (1/(2 f)) (f_xx + f_yy).

Wait, that might be correct. So f is the conformal factor, which is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So substituting into K:

K = - (1/(2 f)) (f_xx + f_yy) )

= - (1/(2 * (32/(4 - x² - y²)))) ) * [128 (4 + x² + y^2) ) / (4 - x² - y²)^3 ]

Simplify each step:

First, 2 * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = 64/(4 - x² - y²).

So 1/(2 f) = (4 - x² - y²)/(64).

So putting it all together:

K = - [ (4 - x² - y²)/(64) ) ] * [ 128 (4 + x² + y²) ) / (4 - x² - y^2)^3 ) ]

Simplify the terms.

The (4 - x² - y²) in the numerator (from first term) and denominator (third term) will cancel, leaving:

= - [ 1/64 ] * [ 128 (4 + x² + y^2) ) / (4 - x² - y^2)^2 ) ]

128 divided by 64 is 2, so:

= - [ 2 (4 + x² + y^2) ) / (4 - x² - y^2)^2 ) ]

Hmm, but wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Gaussian curvature formula.

Wait, maybe I should recall a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps for a metric:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². Wait, but the given metric is in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates.

Wait, but the given metric is written as (dx² + dy²) multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So in polar coordinates, r² = x² + y², so dr² = dx² + dy². So the metric becomes:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Ah, okay, that makes it easier. So in polar coordinates, the metric is:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) [ dr² + r² dθ² ]

So this is similar to a metric in polar coordinates, which can be written as ds² = A(r) dr² + B(r) dθ².

In such cases, the Gaussian curvature K can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 B)) * d/dr (A/B) )

Wait, or perhaps another formula. Alternatively, for a metric in the form ds² = E dr² + F dθ², the curvature can be found using:

K = - (1/(2 E)) (d/dr (E F) ) / r )

Wait, perhaps I need to look for the formula.

Wait, I think the Gaussian curvature for a metric ds² = E dr² + F dθ² in polar coordinates is:

K = - (1/(2 E)) [ (d/dr (E F) ) / r ]

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, here's another approach: the general formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates uses the coefficients g_{rr} and g_{θθ}.

The formula is:

K = - (1/(2 g_{rr})) [ ( ∂/∂r (g_{rr} g_{θθ}) / r ) ) ]

Hmm, I'm probably getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the standard formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric.

In any case, let me proceed with the metric in polar coordinates:

E = 32/(4 - r²)
F = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)

So E = 32/(4 - r²), F = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)

Wait, because dr² is multiplied by E, and dθ² is multiplied by F, which is E * r².

So the metric in polar form is:

ds² = E dr² + F dθ².

The formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates is:

K = - (1/(2 E)) * [ (d/dr (E F) ) / r ]

Let me compute E F: E * F = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32^2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So d/dr (E F) = d/dr [ (1024 r²) / (4 - r^2)^2 ]

Let me compute that derivative.

Let me write it as 1024 r² (4 - r^2)^(-2).

Using the product rule:

d/dr [1024 r^2 (4 - r^2)^{-2} ] = 1024 [ 2r (4 - r^2)^{-2} + r^2 * (-2)(4 - r^2)^{-3} (-2 r) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: 2r * (4 - r^2)^{-2}.

Second term: r^2 * (-2) * (-2 r) * (4 - r^2)^{-3} = r^2 * 4 r * (4 - r^2)^{-3} = 4 r^3 (4 - r^2)^{-3}.

So putting it together:

d/dr (E F) = 1024 [ 2 r (4 - r^2)^{-2} + 4 r^3 (4 - r^2)^{-3} ]

= 1024 [ 2 r / (4 - r^2)^2 + 4 r^3 / (4 - r^2)^3 ]

Factor 2r / (4 - r^2)^3.

Wait, let me factor out 2 r / (4 - r^2)^3.

= 1024 * [ 2 r (4 - r^2) + 4 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^3.

Expand numerator:

2 r (4 - r^2) = 8 r - 2 r^3.

Adding 4 r^3: 8 r - 2 r^3 +4 r^3 = 8r + 2 r^3.

So numerator becomes 8 r + 2 r^3 = 2 r (4 + r^2).

So d/dr (E F) = 1024 * [ 2 r (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^3 ]

= 2048 r (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3.

Now, back to the formula for K:

K = - (1/(2 E)) * [ d/dr (E F) / r ]

Substituting E and d/dr (E F):

E = 32/(4 - r^2)

d/dr (E F) = 2048 r (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3.

So:

K = - [1/(2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) ) ] * [ (2048 r (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) / r ]

Simplify step by step.

First, 2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) ) = 64/(4 - r^2), so 1/(2 E) = (4 - r^2)/(64).

Second, the [ ... ] term is [ (2048 r ...) / ( denominator ) ] divided by r.

So [ (2048 r ... ) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) ] / r = 2048 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3.

So now:

K = - [ (4 - r^2)/(64) ) ] * [ 2048 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

Multiply the terms.

(4 - r^2) in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving (1) in numerator and (4 - r^2)^2 in denominator.

So:

K = - (1/(64)) * (2048 (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^2 )

2048 / 64 = 32.

So K = - 32 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2.

Hmm, but I'm expecting a constant curvature since it's a pseudosphere, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for K. Alternatively, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a metric of the form ds² = (a^2)/(b^2 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is positive or negative? Because the denominator is (b^2 - r^2), when r approaches b from below, the metric blows up, which is similar to the event horizon in a Schwarzschild metric.

Wait, but for a sphere, the metric is ds² = (1 - (2GM)/(r c^2))^{-1} dr² + ... but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature K for this metric and see if it's a constant.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation of K earlier. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is a hyperbolic metric, which has constant negative curvature. The standard form of hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates is:

ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 - (r²/a²)) ) dθ²,

which has Gaussian curvature K = -1/a².

Wait, but in our case, the metric is:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) [ dr² + r² dθ² ]

Which can be rewritten as:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

So the function for the coefficient of dθ² is (32 r²)/(4 - r²). Let me factor out 8, perhaps.

Wait, 32 can be written as 8 *4. So 32/(4 - r²) = 8 *4/(4 - r^2) = 8 (1/(1 - (r²/4))).

Hmm, so perhaps this is similar to the hyperbolic metric but scaled differently.

Wait, the standard hyperbolic metric is:

ds² = dr² + (a^2 / (1 - (r²/a²)) ) dθ².

Which has K = -1/a².

In our case, the metric is:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ².

Which can be rewritten as:

ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) [ dr² + r² dθ² ]

= [32/(4 - r²)] ( dr² + r² dθ² )

Hmm, but in the standard hyperbolic metric, it's:

ds^2 = (a^2) [ dr² + ( r^2 / (a^2 (1 - (r²/a^2)) )) dθ² ]

Wait, perhaps I should compare the two.

In our case, the coefficient of dθ² is (32 r²)/(4 - r^2) = 8 r² (1/(1 - (r²/4))) ) because 4 - r² = 4 (1 - r²/4 ). So 32/(4 - r²) = 8 * [4/(4 - r^2)] = 8 * [1/(1 - (r^2/4)) ].

Wait, perhaps the hyperbolic metric is:

ds² = (a^2) ( dr² + (r²/(a^2 (1 - (r^2/a^2)))) ) dθ^2 )

But in our case, the coefficient for dr² is (32)/(4 - r^2) = 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))].

So comparing, a^2 = 8 * 4 = 32?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps a² is such that (a^2)/(1 - (r²/a²)) ) equals (32 r²)/(4 - r^2).

Wait, perhaps I can write (32 r^2)/(4 - r^2) as (32 r^2)/(4(1 - r^2/4 )) ) = 8 r^2/(1 - r^2/4 )

So that's 8 r² (1/(1 - r^2/4 )).

Which is similar to the standard hyperbolic metric where the coefficient is (a^2 r^2)/(a^2 - r^2) ) = r^2/(1 - r^2/a^2).

So in our case, the coefficient is 8 r^2/(1 - r^2/4 ), so a² is 4, since a^2 =4.

Wait, so a=2.

Wait, then the standard hyperbolic metric would have K = -1/a² = -1/4.

But in our case, the coefficient is 8 r²/(1 - r²/4), which is 8 times larger than the standard case. So then, what's the curvature?

Wait, perhaps when the metric is scaled by a factor, the curvature is scaled inversely.

Wait, because if you have ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ² ), then the Gaussian curvature K is proportional to - (1/f) * (d/dr (f * r^2 )) / r.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of standard hyperbolic space.

In standard hyperbolic space, the metric is:

ds² = dr² + (a^2)/(1 - (r²/a²)) dθ².

Which has K = -1/a².

So in our case, the coefficient of dθ² is (32 r²)/(4 - r²) = 8 r²/(1 - r²/4 ), which is 8 times larger than the standard case where the coefficient would be (a^2)/(1 - r²/a²) with a^2=4.

Wait, but in the standard case, the coefficient is 4/(1 - r²/4 ), so our coefficient is 8 * [ r^2/(1 - r^2/4) ].

Wait, that's 2 * [4/(1 - r^2/4 ) ] * r².

So perhaps the scaling factor affects the curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps the Gaussian curvature is proportional to the negative of the coefficient of dθ² divided by r^2 times some function.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute it. Let me think again about the formula for K.

Wait, for the metric ds² = E dr² + F dθ², the Gaussian curvature is given by:

K = - (1/(2 E)) [ (d/dr (E F) ) / r ]

So in our case, E = 32/(4 - r²), F = (32 r^2)/(4 - r²)

E * F = (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r^2)) ) = (32^2 r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2.

Compute d/dr (E F ) = d/dr [ (1024 r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2 ]

= [ (1024 * 2 r ) (4 - r^2)^2 - 1024 r^2 * 2 (4 - r^2) (-2 r) ) ] / (4 - r^2)^4

Wait, that's applying the quotient rule:

d/dr [N/D] = (N’ D - N D’ ) / D².

N = 1024 r² → N’ = 2048 r.

D = (4 - r²)^2 → D’ = 2 (4 - r^2)(-2 r) )= -4 r (4 - r^2).

So,

d/dr (E F ) = [2048 r (4 - r^2)^2 - 1024 r^2 (-4 r)(4 - r^2) ] / (4 - r^2)^4.

Factor out 2048 r (4 - r^2) from numerator:

= [ 2048 r (4 - r^2) [ (4 - r^2) + 2 r^2 ] ] / (4 - r^2)^4.

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

2048 r (4 - r^2)^2 + 1024 r^2 *4 r (4 - r^2 )

= 2048 r (4 - r^2)^2 + 4096 r^3 (4 - r^2 )

Factor out 2048 r (4 - r^2 ):

= 2048 r (4 - r^2) [ (4 - r^2) + 2 r^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

2048 r (4 - r^2) (4 + r^2 )

So,

d/dr (E F ) = [ 2048 r (4 - r^2) (4 + r^2) ] / (4 - r^2)^4 )

= (2048 r (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

Now, substitute into K:

K = - (1/(2 E)) * (d/dr (E F ) / r )

= - (1/(2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) )) * [ (2048 r (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) / r ]

Simplify:

(2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) ) = 64/(4 - r^2), so 1/(2 E) = (4 - r^2)/(64).

The [ ... ] term is (2048 r ... ) / r → 2048 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3.

So:

K = - ( (4 - r^2)/(64) ) * ( 2048 (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

= - (4 - r^2) * 2048 (4 + r^2) / [64 (4 - r^2)^3 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2048 /64 = 32.

So, K = - 32 (4 + r^2) (4 - r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

The (4 - r^2) terms: in numerator, it's (4 - r^2), denominator has (4 - r^2)^3.

So, K = -32 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, but this still depends on r, so that can't be right because a pseudosphere should have constant curvature.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given metric is not in polar coordinates but in Cartesian coordinates, which complicates things.

Wait, but the metric is conformally flat, so perhaps the Gaussian curvature is the same everywhere. Wait, no, because the function f(x,y) varies with x and y, so the curvature might not be constant.

Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere, which implies constant curvature. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the metric.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²).

If I let r^2 = x² + y², then the metric becomes ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ² ), which is similar to a hyperbolic metric but scaled.

Wait, for a standard hyperbolic metric, the coefficient is 1/(1 - r^2/a^2), so perhaps the given metric is similar but with a different scaling.

Wait, perhaps I can express the given metric as:

ds² = (8 *4)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² )

= 8 * [4/(4 - r^2)] ( dr² + r² dθ² )

= 8 [ 1/(1 - (r^2 /4) ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Which is 8 times a hyperbolic metric with a=2, because 4 is a^2=4, so a=2.

Wait, the standard hyperbolic metric is:

ds² = (a^2)/(a^2 - r^2) (dr² + r^2 dθ² )

So in our case, the a^2 is 4, so a=2.

Then the coefficient is 32/(4 - r^2) = 8 * (4/(4 - r^2)) = 8 * (a^2/(a^2 - r^2)).

So the given metric is 8 times the standard hyperbolic metric.

Wait, but how does scaling the metric affect the curvature?

Well, the Gaussian curvature K is related inversely to the square of the scaling factor. Because if you scale the metric by a factor λ, the curvature scales by 1/λ².

Wait, let me think: if I have a metric g, and I scale it by λ to get λ g, then the curvature K of the scaled metric would be K' = K / λ².

So in our case, the given metric is 8 times the standard hyperbolic metric with a=2, which has K = -1/(a^2) = -1/4.

So the given metric, being 8 times that, would have curvature K' = (-1/4) / (8)^2 )= (-1/4)/(64) )= -1/(256).

Wait, but that doesn't seem to make sense because the pseudosphere should have a constant negative curvature.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature directly.

Let me recompute the Gaussian curvature for the given metric, which is now in polar coordinates as ds² = E dr² + F dθ², where E =32/(4 - r^2), F=32 r^2/(4 - r^2).

The formula for Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2 E)) [ (d/dr (E F) ) / r ]

We computed d/dr (E F ) as (2048 r (4 + r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^3.

So substituting into K:

K = - [ (4 - r^2)/(64) ) ] * [ 2048 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 ) ]

Simplify:

- (4 - r^2) * 2048 (4 + r^2) / [64 (4 - r^2)^3 ]

2048/64 =32.

So K= -32 (4 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2.

Hmm, but this depends on r, which suggests that the curvature is not constant. But that contradicts the assumption that it's a pseudosphere, which should have constant curvature.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K.

Let me check another formula for Gaussian curvature.

Another formula for K in polar coordinates is:

K = - (1/(2 E)) [ (d/dr (E F) ) / r - F / r^2 ]

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the general formula.

Wait, the general formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric coefficients (g_{rr}, g_{θθ}) is:

K = - [ (g_{rr, r} g_{θθ} - g_{rr} g_{θθ, r} ) ] / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

Where the comma denotes the derivative with respect to r.

So, let's compute:

g_{rr} = E =32/(4 - r^2)

g_{θθ} = F = 32 r²/(4 - r^2)

Compute g_{rr, r} = dE/dr = derivative of 32/(4 - r²) = 32 * 2 r / (4 - r^2)^2 = 64 r/(4 - r^2)^2.

g_{θθ, r} = dF/dr = derivative of [32 r^2 (4 - r^2)^{-1} ]

= 32 [ 2 r (4 - r^2)^{-1} + r^2 (-1) (4 - r^2)^{-2} (-2 r) ) ]

=32 [ 2 r/(4 - r^2) + 2 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2 ]

= 64 r/(4 - r^2) + 64 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2.

So now, plug into K:

K = - [ (g_{rr, r} g_{θθ} - g_{rr} g_{θθ, r} ) ] / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

Compute numerator:

g_{rr, r} * g_{θθ} = [64 r/(4 - r^2)^2 ] * [32 r^2/(4 - r^2) ) ]

= (64 r *32 r^2 ) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

= 2048 r^3 / (4 - r^2)^3.

g_{rr} * g_{θθ, r} = [32/(4 - r^2)] * [64 r/(4 - r^2) + 64 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2 ]

= 32/(4 - r^2) * [64 r (4 - r^2) + 64 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^2 )

Wait, let me compute step by step.

g_{θθ, r} is 64 r/(4 - r^2) + 64 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2.

So,

g_{rr} * g_{θθ, r} = [32/(4 - r^2)] * [64 r/(4 - r^2) + 64 r^3/(4 - r^2)^2 ]

= [32/(4 - r^2)] * [ (64 r (4 - r^2) + 64 r^3 ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= [32/(4 - r^2)] * [ (256 r -64 r^3 +64 r^3 ) / (4 - r^2)^2 )

Simplify numerator inside:

256 r -64 r^3 +64 r^3 = 256 r.

So,

= [32/(4 - r^2)] * (256 r ) / (4 - r^2)^2 )

= (32 *256 r ) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

= 8192 r / (4 - r^2)^3.

Now, compute the numerator for K:

g_{rr, r} g_{θθ} - g_{rr} g_{θθ, r} = [2048 r^3 / (4 - r^2)^3 ] - [ 8192 r / (4 - r^2)^3 ]

= [2048 r^3 -8192 r ] / (4 - r^2)^3.

Factor out 2048 r:

= 2048 r (r^2 -4) / (4 - r^2)^3.

Note that (r^2 -4) = -(4 - r^2), so:

= 2048 r (- (4 - r^2)) / (4 - r^2)^3.

= -2048 r (4 - r^2) / (4 - r^2)^3 )

= -2048 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

So K is:

K = - [ numerator ] / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

= - [ (-2048 r ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] / (2 * [32/(4 - r^2)] * [32 r²/(4 - r^2) ) ] )

Simplify denominator of the main fraction: 2 * [32/(4 - r^2)] * [32 r²/(4 - r^2) ) ] = 2*(32*32 r²)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = 2048 r²/(4 - r^2)^2.

So K = - [ (-2048 r ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] / ( 2048 r² / (4 - r^2)^2 ) )

= - [ (-2048 r ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) * (4 - r^2)^2 / (2048 r²) ) ]

= - [ (-2048 r) / (2048 r^2) ) ]

= - [ (-r) / r^2 ) ]

= - [ (-1)/r )

= 1/r.

Wait, that can't be right because curvature shouldn't depend on r. It suggests K=1/r, which varies, which contradicts the notion of a pseudosphere with constant curvature.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the metric isn't one with constant curvature, but the question says it's a pseudosphere, which should have constant curvature.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula. Let me check.

Another source I recall says that for the metric ds² = e^{2φ(r)} (dr² + r² dθ² ), the Gaussian curvature is K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')² + (1/r) φ' ]

Wait, in our case, φ(r) is (1/2) ln (32/(4 - r²)), since ds² = e^{2φ} (dr² + r² dθ² ), where e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r²).

So φ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

Compute φ’ = dφ/dr = (1/2) [ (32/(4 - r²))^{-1} * (64 r/(4 - r^2)^2) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute derivative correctly.

e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - r^2) → 2φ = ln(32) - ln(4 - r^2) → φ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r^2).

So φ’ = dφ/dr = (1/2) * [ 0 - ( (-2 r) / (4 - r^2) ) ]

= (1/2) * (2 r)/(4 - r^2) ) = r/(4 - r^2).

Now, φ'' = d²φ/dr² = [ (4 - r^2) * 1 + r*(2 r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

= [4 - r^2 + 2 r^2 ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

= [4 + r^2 ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Then, the curvature formula becomes:

K = - e^{-2φ} [ φ'' + (φ')^2 + (1/r) φ' ]

But e^{-2φ} = (4 - r^2)/32.

So:

K = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] [ (4 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 + (r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 + (1/r)( r/(4 - r^2) ) ) ]

Simplify each term inside the brackets:

Term 1: (4 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2.

Term 2: (r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2.

Term3: (1/r) * (r/(4 - r^2)) ) = 1/(4 - r^2).

So combining terms:

= [ (4 + r^2) + r^2 ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] + [1/(4 - r^2) )

= [ (4 + 2 r^2) ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] + [ (4 - r^2)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= [ (4 + 2 r^2 +4 - r^2) ] / (4 - r^2)^2 )

= (8 + r^2) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So now, K is:

K = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] * [ (8 + r^2 ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= - [ (8 + r^2 ) / (32 (4 - r^2) ) ]

= - (8 + r^2 ) / [32 (4 - r^2) ) ]

Hmm, that's still dependent on r, which can't be right for a pseudosphere. So I'm clearly making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not of constant curvature, but the question states it's a pseudosphere, so perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the area is being asked, not the curvature. The question is: "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?".

Wait, but pseudosphere is an abstract surface, perhaps in this case, it's mapped to a 2D surface with this metric. So perhaps the area is computed from the metric.

Wait, the area of a surface with metric ds² in polar coordinates is ∫∫ r dr dθ, where r is the radial coordinate.

But wait, in this case, the metric is conformally flat, so the area element is g_{rr} r dr dθ.

Wait, wait, no. The area element in 2D for metric ds² = E dr² + F dθ² is sqrt(E F) r dr dθ.

But in our case, E =32/(4 - r^2) and F =32 r^2/(4 - r^2).

So sqrt(E F) = sqrt( (32/(4 - r^2)) * (32 r^2/(4 - r^2)) ) = sqrt( 1024 r^2 / (4 - r^2)^2 ) = (32 r)/(4 - r^2).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r^2) * r dr dθ = (32 r^2)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

Wait, but the integration limits: what is the domain of r?

The metric ds² has denominator (4 - x² - y²) = (4 - r^2), so to avoid blow-up, 4 - r^2 must be positive → r^2 <4 → r <2.

So the domain is r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r^2/(4 - r^2)] dr dθ.

Factor out constants:

A = 32 ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r^2/(4 - r^2) ] dr.

Integrate over θ first:

∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So,

A = 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r^2/(4 - r^2) ] dr.

= 64 π ∫0^2 [ r^2/(4 - r^2) ] dr.

Hmm, let's compute the integral ∫ [ r^2/(4 - r^2) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution: let u = r^2 → du = 2 r dr → but perhaps a different approach.

Alternatively, note that r^2/(4 - r^2) = -(4 - r^2 +4)/(4 - r^2) ) = -1 + 4/(4 - r^2).

Wait, wait:

r^2/(4 - r^2) = -(4 - r^2 -4)/(4 - r^2) ) = -( (4 - r^2) + (-4) )/(4 - r^2) ) = -(1 - 4/(4 - r^2)).

Wait, perhaps another approach:

r^2 = (4 - (4 - r^2) )

So,

r^2/(4 - r^2) = [4 - (4 - r^2)]/(4 - r^2) ) = 4/(4 - r^2) -1.

So integral becomes:

∫ [4/(4 - r^2) -1 ] dr.

So,

= ∫4/(4 - r^2) dr - ∫1 dr.

= 4 ∫1/(4 - r^2) dr - r.

The integral ∫1/(4 - r^2) dr is (1/4) ln | (2 + r)/(2 - r) | ) + C.

So,

=4 * (1/4) ln | (2 + r)/(2 - r) | ) - r + C.

= ln( (2 + r)/(2 - r) ) - r + C.

Evaluate from 0 to 2.

At r=2:

ln( (2+2)/(2-2) ) → ln(4/0) → ln(inf) → ∞.

So as r approaches 2 from below, the integral goes to infinity.

But wait, that can't be right because the area would be infinite, but the options include option D) +infty.

Wait, but in the question, the pseudosphere has radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps the area is infinite, which would make option D the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric represents a pseudosphere with infinite area, which is a characteristic of hyperbolic surfaces. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a disk of radius r is proportional to e^{2φ}, which for a pseudosphere (infinite radius) would have infinite area.

But in our case, the radius is given as 2, but the area is still infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions, and the surface described by this metric is a pseudosphere. The pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and its area can be computed using the metric.

### Step 1: Area Element
The area element for a metric of the form \( ds^2 = g(x, y) (dx^2 + dy^2) \) is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, \( g = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 2: Switch to Polar Coordinates
To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( x = r \cos \theta \), and \( y = r \sin \theta \). The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The domain of integration is determined by the denominator \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \), which implies \( r^2 < 4 \) or \( r < 2 \). Thus, \( r \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 2 \), and \( \theta \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).

### Step 3: Total Area
The total area \( A \) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( \theta \):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Now, the area becomes:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral
To compute \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
- When \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \).

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \Big|_0^4 = \ln(4) - \ln(0).
\]

As \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

### Conclusion
The pseudosphere described by the given metric has infinite area. This is consistent with the properties of hyperbolic surfaces, where the area of a pseudosphere grows exponentially with the radius and becomes infinite as the radius approaches the curvature radius.
