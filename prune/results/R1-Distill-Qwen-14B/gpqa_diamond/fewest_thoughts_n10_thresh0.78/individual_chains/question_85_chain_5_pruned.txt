Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors. Oh right, the formula is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5, all multiplied by (Lstar/(L_sun))^(1/2) maybe? Wait, no, maybe I should think about how the star's luminosity and the planet's distance play into this.

Wait, the star's luminosity probably comes from its radius and temperature. Oh, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. So L is proportional to R² T^4.

But equilibrium temperature for a planet is given by the formula: Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5, where A is the albedo. Oh wait, but I think the exact formula might be Te = T_star * [ (R_star/(2a) )^(1/2) ] * sqrt( (1 - A) ). Because the equilibrium temperature equation comes from setting the power received equal to the power emitted. So the planet absorbs (L / (4π a² )) * (π R_planet²) * (1 - A) and emits as a blackbody: 4π R_planet² σ Te^4. Setting them equal,
