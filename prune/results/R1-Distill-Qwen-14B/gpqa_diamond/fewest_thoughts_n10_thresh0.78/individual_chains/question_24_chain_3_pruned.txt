Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and think it through step by step.

The question is about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form a new mixture Y of two liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y under severe conditions gives the same hydrocarbon Z, which has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably fully saturated, maybe an alkane. Moreover, the mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm, so let me break it down.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually indicates the presence of alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated compounds like conjugated dienes, aromatic rings, etc. But wait, the problem states that X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds. So X must have simple alkenes, not conjugated. So the mixture X likely contains alkenesâ€”so each component is an alkene.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The products form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Since Y doesn't cause bromine to decolorize, it probably doesn't have any double bonds. So the reaction is likely hydrogenation, but wait, the question says it's a disproportionation. Oh, so it's a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, what kind of compounds undergo disproportionation when heated with Pt?

Wait, maybe it's a diene or something else. Wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of alkenes, and when hydrogenated, it gives a single product Z. So both components of X, when hydrogenated, produce Z. That suggests that perhaps X is a mixture of isomers that upon hydrogenation become the same compound.

Wait, but the initial step is that when mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation. Oh, so perhaps the reaction isn't hydrogenation but something else. Because the problem says, after treatment with Pt when heated, they form Y. Then, hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "...when treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation..."

So, X is treated with Pt and heat, which causes a disproportionation, giving Y. So X is a mixture that undergoes a disproportionation reaction with Pt, leading to Y, which is another equimolar mixture of two liquids.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, they give Z, which is a hydrocarbon.

So, let's think about the possible reactions. Disproportionation would involve a substance being both oxidized and reduced. What compounds undergo such reactions? Maybe something like an alcohol, or perhaps a diene. Wait, another thought: maybe X contains a compound with both al
