Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that seems a bit off because I thought quantum states are typically represented as unit vectors, which means the sum of the squares of their elements should be 1. Let me check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, right, so maybe the state is not normalized. Hmm, does that matter? Well, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by vectors with a norm of 1. Maybe the given state is normalized by dividing each component by sqrt(6)? Or perhaps the problem is written in a way that's a bit different. I'll keep that in mind.

Next, the operators for two observables, P and Q, are given. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The matrix for Q has elements (1, 0, 0) in the first row, (0,0,0) in the second, and (0,0,-1) in the third. So Q is a diagonal matrix, which makes me think it's a pretty straightforward operator to work with.

The question is about measuring P and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, noâ€”the order is that Q is measured just after P. Wait, no, the wording is: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is: first measure P, then Q. We need the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

But wait, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So first, when P is measured, the state will collapse to an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when Q is measured on this new state, it will collapse to an eigenvector of Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. The probability would be the product of the probabilities of each step, assuming each measurement is independent, but I think it's a bit more involved than that.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to find the combined probability of P=0 and Q=-1. Or maybe we should think in terms of the eigenstates and compute the probabilities step by step.

First, let's re-normalize the state vector. The given state is (-1, 2, 1). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2
