Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

There are two reactions given, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, match them with the options provided.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. The second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, which is LDA.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure must be something like two rings (3 and 5 membered?) connected at the same carbon which is the -OH bearing carbon. The vinyl group is at position 1, which is the same as the spiro carbon. So the structure is a spiro compound with a double bond.

The reaction conditions are THF (a solvent), KH (a strong base, potassium hydride), and an acidic workup (H+). So I'm thinking this is an elimination reaction. Dehydration, perhaps? Because when alcohols are treated with strong bases, they usually lose water to form alkenes, or maybe undergo some kind of ring-forming elimination.

Wait, but the starting material already has a double bond. So perhaps the reaction is leading to a cyclization. The spiro structure has two rings attached. If the base abstracts a proton that's anti to the hydroxyl group, leading to elimination of water and formation of a double bond. But considering the structure, maybe the base would cause a ring expansion or some kind of electrocyclic reaction.

Alternatively, the elimination could form a larger ring. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, so the main ring is 3.5 (non implies 9 carbons?), wait no, the spiro is [3.5], so the two rings are 3-membered and 5-membered, connected at the same carbon. The non- part suggests the main chain is 9 carbons? Hmm, maybe I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Wait, spiro compounds have two rings connected at one atom. The first part is [3.5], which means one ring is 3-membered and the other is 5-membered. The molecule is non-enol, so the main chain is 9 carbons. But with the spiro structure, maybe the total is different. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination could cause a ring formation.

Another possibility is that the base abstracts a proton beta to the hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of a double bond adjacent to the existing double bond, which might lead to a conjugated diene. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, wait. Another thought: Treatment with a strong base like KH (which is a strong base, but in THF, which is a coordinating solvent) under heat might lead to
