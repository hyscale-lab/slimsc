Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember from my studies that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, I think they're used for accelerating particles to high energies. 

The question says that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T≈0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe that refers to two stages or something else. But I'll come back to that.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So this is an alternating voltage, varying with time. The problem gives Φ0 as π/4 and U0 as 190 kV. 

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A to D, with numbers like 1864, 5300, etc.

I'm a bit rusty on the exact process, but I remember that in a cyclotron, particles move in a circular path, and every time the electric field reverses, they get an additional push. The frequency of the electric field must be synchronized with the particle's orbit frequency. 

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron, which is a type of cyclotron that uses a varying magnetic field to keep the particles in phase with the electric field. Oh right, because as particles gain energy, their mass increases (relativistically), so the cyclotron frequency changes. So the magnetic field has to be adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the electric field's frequency. 

But how does that help me calculate the number of revolutions? Hmm. Let me think about the basic equations here.

In cyclotrons, the time period for a particle to complete an orbit is given by T = (2π m)/(qB), where m is the mass, q is the charge, and B is the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field is varying, this period changes. Wait, but maybe during the acceleration, the magnetic field is adjusted so that the frequency of the electric field remains in sync with the particle
