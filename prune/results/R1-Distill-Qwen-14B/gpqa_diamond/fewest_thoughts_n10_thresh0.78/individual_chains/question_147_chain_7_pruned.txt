Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, so a proton and an antiproton annihilate into these two A particles each with positive and negative charges? Interesting.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, does that mean we can treat its kinetic energy as negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Because for slow-moving particles, their kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass. So maybe we can approximate it as being at rest? Or wait, is it the other way around? No, wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so its speed is low. So perhaps the initial momentum is not very high compared to the rest mass.

But wait, the proton is moving towards the antiproton. Oh wait, no, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest? Or both are moving? Hmm, the wording says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps only the antiproton has some velocity, but it's small.

Wait, but in the annihilation process, both the proton and antiproton are annihilating. So in the center-of-momentum frame, perhaps? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300
