Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

So the state |ψ⟩ is a column vector [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. Let me note that down.

I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding probability.

Wait, yeah, because if the matrix is diagonal, each diagonal element is the eigenvalue corresponding to each basis vector. So the expectation value would be the sum of |c_i|² * p_i, where c_i are the components of the state vector, and p_i are the eigenvalues of P_z.

Looking at the P_z matrix:

It's given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩.

The state vector has components a= -1/2 (for |1⟩), b=1/√2 (for |2⟩), c= -1/2 (for |3⟩).

Wait, but the state vector is given as ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of each component.

So let's compute each component squared:

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|^2 = (1/√2
