Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The problem gives two parts: part A asks which compound does not show tautomerism, and part B asks which of two compounds shows optical isomerism. Then there are four options, each pairing A and B with different compounds.

First, let's understand what tautomerism is. Tautomerism, also known as keto-enol tautomerism, occurs when a compound can shift between keto and enol forms. For this to happen, the molecule must have a carbonyl group adjacent to a hydroxyl group or an alpha hydrogen. If a compound doesn't have the right structural features, it won't exhibit tautomerism.

Now, looking at the compounds given for part A:

1. Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two ketone groups (O) in the para positions. So, structure-wise, it's O=C6H4=O. Alternatively, sometimes it's called 1,4-benzoquinone. But does it have any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Let me imagine the structure. The carbonyls are at positions 1 and 4. The benzene ring is connected to each. So each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons would be connected to the ring, but the ring carbons don't have hydrogens unless it's a different structure. Wait, no, in benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated, so each carbonyl is on a carbon that's part of the ring. So the carbonyl C is connected to two ring carbons and an O. So for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyls are each attached directly to the ring. So each carbonyl group is on a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring. So the carbonyl carbons don't have hydrogens attached. Therefore, there's no alpha hydrogen. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible. So benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

2. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The structure here is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of those carbons has a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure. Each ketone is on a carbon that's part of the ring. So each ketone is connected to two other carbons in the ring. Now, each of those ketone carbons must have two other ring carbons attached. But wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So 1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups at every other carbon. So each ketone is at a carbon that's part of the ring, and the adjacent carbons (the ones next to the ketones) would be connected to other ring carbons. So for each ket
