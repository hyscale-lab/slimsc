Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully and try to break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. These Y don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y is a result of a disproportionation reaction from X.

Next, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they each give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent widely used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated, maybe an alkane.

The other part says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, the two liquids in X probably don't have conjugated double bonds. That might mean they're either single bonds or maybe non-conjugated double bonds, but not like in alkenes where the double bonds are next to each other.

Let me think about the possible substances involved. If X can decolorize bromine water, it probably contains unsaturated bonds. Like alkenes or alkynes. Because bromine adds across double bonds, causing decolorization. Also, if the mixture is undergoing a reaction when treated with platinum, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation or some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, but when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms Y which is a result of a disproportionation. So, that suggests that the starting materials in X are such that each can split into two different products in Y. But wait, the problem says it's a mixture of two liquids. So X has two components, each of which undergoes a reaction to form two new components in Y.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a di-substituted alkene that on hydrogenation gives two different alkanes? Or maybe X is a mixture of alkenes that after hydrogenation become alkanes, but that doesn't fit the idea of a disproportionation.

Wait a minute, the reaction is a disproportionation, so one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Oh, wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction when treated with Pt and heat.

Wait, maybe the components in X are alkenes or something that can undergo isomerism. But I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the hydrogenation part. When X is hydrogenated, it gives only Z. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated gives Z as well. So both X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, end up with the same compound Z. That suggests that Z is the fully saturated version, perhaps the result of hydrogenation of whatever double bonds or triple bonds were present.

Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. Let's assume Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CnHm.

The mass fraction of hydrogen would be (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%. So:

( m ) / (12n + m ) = 0.1428

Let me solve for m in terms of n.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m )

m = 1.7136 n + 0.1428 m

Bring the 0.1428 m to the left:

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n

0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136 n

Dividing both sides:

m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572 )
