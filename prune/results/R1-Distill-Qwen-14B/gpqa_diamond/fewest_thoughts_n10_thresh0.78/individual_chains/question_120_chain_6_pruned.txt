Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx to the first, second, third, or fourth power. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, actually, I remember that the parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax. So parallax (in arcseconds) equals 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / d, where d is distance in parsecs.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes with parallax. So I think I need to find the number of stars with a certain parallax range. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, maybe I can model this as a volume in space.

Wait, the number density of stars might be uniform. So if the number of stars depends on the volume, and since volume depends on distance, I should probably relate parallax to distance and then to volume.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d+dd would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars dN would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But parallax is plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that. d squared is (1/plx)^2. And dd would be the change in d, but since plx is 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, maybe I should express dN in terms of plx instead of d.

So, dN = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ). Wait, but I can ignore the negative sign because I'm considering the magnitude. So dN = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. That simplifies to dN = 4π n / plx^4 d plx.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So dN/(d plx) would be the number per unit plx. So from the equation, that's (4π n)/ plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, but wait, I'm considering a thin shell in distance space and converting it to plx. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of stars in a given parallax interval, say from plx to plx + dplx. Since plx =1/d, each increase in plx corresponds to a decrease in d. So the number of stars in that interval would be the number of stars at a distance d=1/plx, and the volume around that point.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume is uniform. So the number in a volume element
