Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics (CED).

Wait, what's regularization? I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—places where calculations give infinite results. So it's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the infinities manageable.

Now, let's go through each option.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, that's the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't really deal with the same issues as quantum ones because they don't have the same infinities. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges, but the math might get tricky. But I don't think you need regularization because regularization is a quantum thing. So classical theories don't require it. So maybe D is the correct answer.

But wait, the other options: QED, QCD, and Superstring Theory.

QED is Quantum Electrodynamics. I remember that QED is a well-behaved theory in terms of renormalization. It has divergences, but you can handle them with renormalization techniques. But does it require regularization? Regularization is part of the renormalization process. So yes, QED does require regularization in calculations. So option C probably isn't the right answer.

QCD is Quantum Chromodynamics, which deals with the strong force. I think QCD has its own issues, like confinement and things. But in terms of regularization, I believe it does require it because of the divergences in loop calculations. So option B would require regularization.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory of strings. I'm not too familiar with the details, but I think string theories are designed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same UV divergences that QFTs have. Because in string theory, particles are extended objects, and the perturbation series might behave better. So superstring theory might not require regularization because the theory is already free from such divergences. Wait, but wait—when you do calculations, especially perturbative ones, do they still need regularization? Or does string
