Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian determines whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have terms with mass dimension less than or equal to 4, I think. Because in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Wait, no, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the integral over dx^4 is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So to find the mass dimension of κ, I should calculate the dimension of each part of the term and set the sum to 4.

Let me break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's find the dimensions of each component.

First, the Dirac field ψ. I remember that for a Dirac spinor, [ψ]_M = 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so each ψ must have dimension 3/2 for the term to be (3/2 + 1 + 3/2) = 4.

So [ψ]_M = 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ have mass dimension 0, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices antisymmetrized, so it's dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}]_M = 0.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F^{μν} is defined as ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative contributes dimension 1, and A^μ has dimension 1 (since the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is like (1/4) F², which must have dimension 4. Let's think: [F]^2 should be dimension 4. F is ∂A, so [F]_M = 1 + 1 = 2. So [F]^2 is 4, which makes the term (1/4) F² have dimension 4. So yes, [F]_M = 2.

Wait, but in this case, F^μν is for a non-Abelian field maybe? Well, the dimension would still be the same, because the field strength tensor's components are derivatives of the gauge field. So [F]_M = 2.

Putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, F^{μν}.

So each component's dimension:

ψ̄: same as ψ, which is 3/2.

σ_{μν}: 0.

ψ: 3/2.

F^{μν}: 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

(3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 *2 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

Wait, no: wait, actually, the term is ψ̄ multiplied by σ, multiplied by ψ, multiplied by F. So each term's dimension adds up. So [ψ̄] = 3/2, [σ] =0, [ψ]=3/2, [F]=2. So total is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = (3/2 +3/2 )=3, plus 2 is 5.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by something of dimension 5. And the term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian.

So [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1.
