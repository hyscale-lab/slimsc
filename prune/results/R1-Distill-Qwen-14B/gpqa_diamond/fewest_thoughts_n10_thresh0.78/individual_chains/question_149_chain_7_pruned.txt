Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to unpack it. Hmm, so the scenario is that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized, and when they run the 1H NMR, most of the peaks look right except for two that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, they've ruled out spin-spin coupling as the cause. 

Wait, so the NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. That's unusual. Normally, if a proton has equivalent neighbors, it would be a singlet, or maybe split into a multiplet. But if they're the same alpha proton, why two peaks? Spin-spin coupling is out, so maybe it's something else. Oh, maybe it's diastereotopic protons? Like if the molecule has some kind of symmetry breaking due to stereochemistry. 

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks with same mass, same intensity. So, same molecular weight. So it's not a fragment or a degradation product. If it's two peaks with same mass, maybe they're isomers. Could be enantiomers or diastereomers. 

The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would probably have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction. So if the LC-MS shows same mass, that's probably not it. Unless the precursor is a different form but same mass. Not sure, but maybe not.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, if the molecule has some symmetry, maybe the protons would look the same. But wait, if the molecule is chiral, and they're enantiomers, then in 1D NMR, the peaks should be the same because enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. But the question says two peaks for the same alpha proton. So if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as a pure sample because the peaks overlap. So this doesn't explain the two separate peaks. Hmm.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond forming. So when forming an amide bond, sometimes you can get coupling between the alpha protons and the amide protons? Or maybe during the reaction, some double coupling occurs leading to splitting. Wait, the problem says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so maybe this isn't it. Or maybe it's a different kind of coupling. Not sure, but I might need to think more.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would differ. But wait, if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts and the peaks are overlapping, but for the same proton. Wait, the question says that the two peaks in NMR correspond to the same alpha-proton. So if the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, maybe each diastereomer has an alpha proton in a slightly different environment, so their shifts are similar but not identical. But why two separate peaks? Because each diastereomer's alpha proton would appear as a separate peak. So the integral adds up to 1H because it's one proton in
