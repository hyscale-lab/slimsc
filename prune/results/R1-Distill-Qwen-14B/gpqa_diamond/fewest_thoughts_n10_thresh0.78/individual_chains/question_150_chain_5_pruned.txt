Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question provides a molecular formula, some NMR data, and a series of reactions. My task is to figure out what the final product is from the given options.

Alright, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, what's the degree of unsaturation here? Let me calculate that. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU, since it's 3 double bonds and a ring) plus another double bond or ring. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond or ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), that's a triplet. High upfield for a triplet, but 9.7 is quite downfield. Maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, a triplet at 9.72—so what could have a triplet there? Maybe an aldehyde coupled with another proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually deshielded and don't split unless coupled with something. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a specific environment, but 9.7 is a bit high for a phenolic OH, which is usually broader and around 5 ppm or so. Phenyl protons are typically lower downfield, like around 7 ppm. So 9.72 is probably the aldehyde proton.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), and 6.27 (bs, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each, which suggests two sets of adjacent protons, possibly para-substituted rings. Oh wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, you get a doublet of doublets? Wait, no, for para substitution, it's more about the splitting between the two sets of equivalent protons. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is para to another. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like a para-substituted ring with two substituents.

The 6.98 and 6.51 being doublets each suggests that each proton is next to one other proton, or perhaps they're part of a meta arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps these are two different aromatic rings. Wait, di-substituted benzene rings can have different coupling constants. Let me think—if it's a para-substituted benzene, each pair of protons would be a doublet, but perhaps with the same or different coupling constants. Hmm, but the two doublets here have different chemical shifts—so maybe they are each from a different aromatic
