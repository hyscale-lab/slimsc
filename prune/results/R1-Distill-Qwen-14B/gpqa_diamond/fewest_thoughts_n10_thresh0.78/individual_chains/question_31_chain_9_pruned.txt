Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions and symmetry groups, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me break down each step.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid is a strong nitrating agent, especially when sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst. Toluene has a methyl group attached to a benzene ring. When aromatic compounds like toluene undergo nitration, the nitro group tends to substitute in a position relative to the methyl group. I think in toluene, the methyl is activating, so the nitro group would add in the ortho or para positions. Wait, but nitration is a meta-directing group? No, wait, toluene has the methyl group which is activating and ortho/para-directing. So the nitration would occur at the ortho or para positions relative to the methyl.

But wait, nitration is typically a meta-directing group when the substituent is deactivating. Oh wait, no: methyl is activating, so the nitration occurs ortho and para. So product 1 is nitrotoluene in either o or p. But wait, nitration is a meta director if the substituent is deactivating. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Toluene has a methyl group, which is an activating group. So the nitration will occur where? The nitration reaction is an electrophilic substitution. The methyl group is ortho/para directing. So the nitro group will enter at either ortho or para positions relative to the methyl group.

But when nitric acid is used with sulfuric acid, it's a strong nitrating mixture. So toluene would react to form nitrotoluene. The major product is the para isomer because para is more stable due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene, I think.

Wait, but sometimes, the ortho product is formed in some cases. Hmm. Well, I think the major product is para. So moving on.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. In acidic conditions
