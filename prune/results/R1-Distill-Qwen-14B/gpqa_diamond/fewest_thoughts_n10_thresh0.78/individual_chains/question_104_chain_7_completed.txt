Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the RV method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period, I think. 

The question states that two stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main difference is the Doppler shift observed: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. 

Wait, what does the Doppler shift tell us? Oh right, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. I think the formula is K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. The formula is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) ) ) ) or wait, maybe it's more about the relationship between K and the orbital period. Oh wait, I think the formula relates K to the orbital period, mass of the planet, and the mass of the star. 

Wait, the formula I think is K = [ ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/(something)) ) divided by (P^(1/3)), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. 

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be calculated using the formula: 

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) 

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) / (4 c^3 )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So if K is larger, the period is shorter. 

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) ). So, for the same M_p and M_star, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

Wait, no, let's think carefully. The formula I remember is K = (v) which is ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (P^(1/3)) ) ) But I might be mixing up the exponents. Alternatively, another way to write it is K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) / (some constants).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and P. If all else is equal, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then if K doubles, P becomes 1/(2^3) = 1/8th. So if K is larger, P is shorter.

In the problem, planet #1 causes a 5 mA shift, planet #2 a 7 mA. So K2 = 7/5 * K1. Wait, no, wait. The given values are the periodic shifts, so K for planet #1 is 5 mA, K for planet #2 is 7 mA.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), the ratio of (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Let me write the formula for K.

The formula is K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

So, rearranging, K = (constant) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Assuming that the two planets have the same mass (same M_p), and the stars have the same mass (same M_star), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So,

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

Wait, wait, because K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), so K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

Therefore, (K1/K2) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Which can be solved for P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So, in this problem, K1 is 5 mA, K2 is 7 mA. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Then, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3. Let me compute that.

0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.71^3 is about 0.357, 0.714^3 is approximately 0.364.

So P2 is roughly 0.364 times P1. Which would mean that P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1. 

So the question is asking: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So the ratio is P2/P1 ≈ 0.36. So that is, P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter, not longer. Wait, wait, the question is, "how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's 0.36 times as long, so it's shorter. So the answer would be 0.36 times. So the ratio P2/P1 = 0.36, so the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times the period of planet #1. Therefore, planet #2's period is shorter. 

Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A. 

Wait, but let me double-check the logic. Because K is larger when the star's velocity is higher. A higher K implies a higher velocity, which would mean a shorter period for the same mass. Because a higher velocity would mean the star is moving faster in its orbit, implying a shorter period since the star has to complete an orbit more quickly. So, yes, larger K implies shorter period. 

So in this case, planet #2's K is larger (7 mA) than planet #1's (5 mA), so planet #2 must have a shorter period. So the ratio P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.36. So yes, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter, but the question is asking "how many times longer" planet #2's period is. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that's 0.36 times as long. So the period is shorter, not longer. So the answer is 0.36 times as long. 

So the options include A as ~0.36. So the correct answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the planet-to-star mass ratio is constant. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that planet #1 causes a Doppler shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \, \text{mA} \)) and planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \, \text{mA} \)), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \approx 0.714 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx (0.714)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. The question asks how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the answer is approximately 0.36.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~0.36**

Answer: A
