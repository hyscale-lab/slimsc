Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, it induces charges on the conductor's surface. But since the sphere is grounded, it can lose or gain electrons as needed. Oh wait, right, grounding allows the sphere to maintain an overall neutral charge because any excess charge can flow into the ground.

Wait, but in this case, the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the induced charges on the sphere's surface will be opposite in sign to q. Because like charges repel and opposites attract. So if q is positive, the sphere's induced charges are negative, and vice versa.

Now, the potential energy of a system is typically the work done to assemble the charges. So I think I need to find the potential energy due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded. The induced charges on the sphere will consist of a charge -q, because the sphere was initially neutral but q's electric field induces charges. Or is it different? Because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would adjust to keep the sphere's potential at zero.

Hmm, no. Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges will reside on the surface. Since it's grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So any induced charges will be such that the potential on the sphere remains zero.

Alternatively, when a charge q is outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on the sphere is zero. So the sphere's induced charges can be thought of as forming an image charge configuration.

Oh right, the method of images! That's the concept I should be using here. The image charge for a sphere when a charge is placed outside is at a certain position. The image charge q' would be inside the sphere, at a distance from the center that's (R^2/d). Because the image distance is (R^2/d) when the actual charge is at d.

Wait, the formula for the image charge in the case of a conducting sphere... I think the image charge q' is (R²/d) * q, but wait, no, the position is more important. So the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance of R²/d from the center, but in the same line as the original charge.

Wait, no, the position of the image charge is given by (R²/d) from the center. So if the original charge is at d, the image is at R²/d. So for example, if R is 2 and d is 4, the image is at (4/4)=1, so 1 radius away. Oh right.

So the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q'. Because the sphere's induced charges are equivalent to having this image charge inside
