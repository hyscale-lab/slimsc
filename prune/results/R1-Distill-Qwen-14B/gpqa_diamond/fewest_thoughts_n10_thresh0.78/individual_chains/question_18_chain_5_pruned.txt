Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, they've determined some abundances. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. We're given the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2) or the ratio of Star_1's Si to Star_2's Si.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the notation right. The [X/Y] notation usually represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So, it's the logarithmic difference from the Sun's value.

Given that, let's break down the data.

First, let's figure out the abundance ratios for each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, what's [Si/Fe]_sun? Since for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is 0, because [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - solar value, which is 0. So, for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, as given. Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) is 7.

Wait, but the [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so that means:

log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, what's [Si/Fe]_sun? Since for the Sun, [X/Y] is 0 when both are solar, so [Si/Fe]_sun would be zero? Because [Si/Fe] is the log ratio of Si to Fe in the star minus that in the Sun. So if the Sun has [Si/Fe]_sun = 0, then Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The [X/Y] notation is defined as log10(nX/nY in star) - log10(nX/nY in Sun).

So for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3

We need to find the ratio of silicon in each star compared to the Sun. Wait, but actually, the question asks for the ratio of Si
