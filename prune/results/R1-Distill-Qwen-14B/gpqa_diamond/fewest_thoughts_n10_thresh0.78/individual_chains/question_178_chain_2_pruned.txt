Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of Lagrangians and renormalizability. But let's give it a shot.

The question is about a given Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}, where σ_μν is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it tells us about renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have mass dimensions that are non-negative (I think). Or wait, maybe it's that the dimension has to be less than or equal to some number? Hmm, I think the rule is that each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4, because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, the action has no units, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4).

Wait, no. Wait, the Lagrangian is a density. So the Lagrangian itself is in units of mass^4, because the action ∫ d^4x L has to be dimensionless. So each term in L must have mass dimension 4.

So, for each term in the Lagrangian, the sum of the mass dimensions of its components must be 4.

So, let's look at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I need to find the mass dimensions of each of these variables: κ, ψ, σ, F.

I remember that in the Standard Model, fermions (like ψ) have a mass dimension of 3/2. Wait, because the Dirac Lagrangian is L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The kinetic term is dimension 4, so each ψ must be 3/2, because ∂ is mass dimension 1. So i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ: ψ is 3/2, derivative is 1. So 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. That makes sense.

Then, the field strength tensor F is built from the field A, which is a gauge field. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1. Because the Maxwell Lagrangian is F^2, which is (∂A)^2, each A is dimension 1 because ∂ is 1, and (∂A) is 2. Wait, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each F has mass dimension 2.

So F^{μν} is dimension 2.

Next, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless, right? So σ is also dimensionless because it's built from γ matrices and their commutators. So the term σ_{μν} is dimension 0.

Now, putting it all together in the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is dimension 3/2 each, so together they contribute 3.

The F term is dimension 2.

So the total dimension of the term without κ is 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, because the product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3, and F is 2,
