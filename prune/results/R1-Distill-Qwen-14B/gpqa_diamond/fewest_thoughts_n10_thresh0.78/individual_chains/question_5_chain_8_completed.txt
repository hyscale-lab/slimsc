Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Okay, let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like P (which I think is spin here, maybe similar to the Pauli matrices) have specific eigenvectors. But wait, in this case, the operator is given as P, which might be analogous to spin-1/2 operators. Oh, right, because the components are 2x2 matrices, which makes sense for spin-1/2 systems.

The problem gives me the components Px, Py, and Pz. So P is a vector operator, and the question is about its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but lying in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be zero or something else? Wait, no, the direction is in x-z, so φ is 0 or π? Wait, in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ is the angle around the z-axis. If the direction is in x-z, then φ could be 0 or π, but maybe it's arbitrary. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, meaning that the direction has some angle θ from the z-axis and φ is 0. Hmm, but perhaps that's not directly needed here.

Wait, the eigenvector we're looking for is for the operator P along direction n. So P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. Since n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component (ny) is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. But wait, since it's in the x-z plane, perhaps θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, z = cosθ. If φ=0, then x = sinθ, y=0, z=cosθ.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so perhaps we don't need to specify φ. But for the operator P·n, since n lies in x-z, it's P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).

So the operator in question is P·n, and we need its eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

First, I need to find the matrix representation of P·n. Let's see, P_x is given as (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. And P_y is (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]] but since n is in x-z, the P_y term is zero because ny=0.

So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let's compute each term. Let's denote n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since in the x-z plane, φ=0.

So,

P·n = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So let's compute that:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
              [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let's compute each element:

Top left element: 0 * sinθ + 1 * cosθ * (ħ/2) ? Wait no, wait. Wait, P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by sinθ, it's sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_z is multiplied by cosθ. So adding them:

Top left: 0 * sinθ + (1 * cosθ) * (ħ/2? Wait, no. Wait, each term is:

sinθ * (ħ/2) * 0 (for top left of P_x) plus cosθ * (ħ/2) * 1 (top left of P_z). So top left is (ħ/2) * cosθ.

Top right: sinθ*(ħ/2)*1 + cosθ*(ħ/2)*0. So top right is (ħ/2) sinθ.

Similarly, bottom left: sinθ*(ħ/2)*1 and bottom right: sinθ*(ħ/2)*0 + cosθ*(ħ/2)* (-1). So bottom right is -(ħ/2) cosθ.

So overall, the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2 cosθ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ],
  [ (ħ/2 sinθ), (-ħ/2 cosθ) ] ]

So P·n is this matrix. Now, we need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. So for λ = ħ/2,

The matrix becomes:

[ ( (ħ/2 cosθ) - ħ/2 ), (ħ/2 sinθ) ] 
[ (ħ/2 sinθ), ( - ħ/2 cosθ - ħ/2 ) ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ/2 (cosθ -1 ), ħ/2 sinθ ]
[ ħ/2 sinθ,  - ħ/2 (cosθ + 1) ]

We can factor out ħ/2:

ħ/2 [ [ (cosθ -1 ), sinθ ],
        [ sinθ,  -(cosθ +1 ) ] ]

So the matrix equation is [A] |v> = 0, where A is the matrix above.

The determinant of the matrix (A) should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

But since this is an eigenvalue equation, I can write the equations from the matrix.

Let me denote the eigenvector as (a, b)^T.

So the equations are:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1 ) b = 0

So from the first equation:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0 => (cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b => a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b

Wait, because (cosθ - 1) = -(1 - cosθ), so (cosθ -1 ) a = - (1 - cosθ) a.

So,

- (1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0 => sinθ b = (1 - cosθ) a => a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Alternatively, a = [ (sinθ)/(1 - cosθ) ] b

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this expression. Let's recall that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting,

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) / ( 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b

= cot(θ/2) * b

So a = cot(θ/2) b

Wait, but let's check this. If θ = 0, then cosθ=1, which would cause division by zero. But in that case, the original equation would have a different condition, but perhaps that's a limit.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of b. Let me set b = 1 (for simplicity, as eigenvectors are up to a scalar multiple). So a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the equation, a = [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ] b. Let's see:

Hmm, let's take a step back. Let me think about the equations again.

From the first equation: (cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0.

Let me factor out (1 - cosθ):

( cosθ -1 ) = - (1 - cosθ ), so equation becomes:

- (1 - cosθ) a + sinθ b = 0

=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b

=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Now, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2) 

And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b

Simplify: (2 cancels, sin(theta/2) in numerator and denominator cancels once)

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b = cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the eigenvector components are a = cot(theta/2) b, and b = b.

Let me choose b = 1 for simplicity. So a = cot(theta/2).

Wait, but when θ is zero, cot(theta/2) would be cot(0) which is infinity. Hmm, but when theta is zero, the direction is along the z-axis. Then, let's see what P·n is.

Wait, if theta is zero, then P·n = P_z. The eigenvalues of P_z are ± ħ/2. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is (1,0)^T, which is (a, b) = (1,0). But according to our expression, when theta approaches zero, cot(theta/2) approaches infinity, which suggests that a approaches infinity, but that's perhaps not the right way to look at it because in reality, when theta is zero, the eigenvector is (1,0). Hmm, perhaps using these parametric expressions, when theta is zero, the expression for a would be infinity, which is a bit confusing. Maybe I should instead set a as 1, and solve for b.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the ratio a/b as cot(theta/2), which would be correct. So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = (cot(theta/2), 1), but that's not normalized. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express this as a function of theta/2.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 along an arbitrary direction n are given by the spin coherent states. The general form is |n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, but I'm not sure about the phase. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector can be written in terms of spherical angles.

Wait, our earlier steps led us to a = cot(theta/2) * b. Let me choose b = sin(theta/2), so that a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2). So the vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, let me check that. Let's compute a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2). Then, let's see if this satisfies the equation.

From earlier, the equation was (cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0.

Substituting a and b, does this hold?

Let me compute (cosθ -1 ) cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2).

Using trigonometric identities:

cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2) - 1.

So cosθ -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 -1 = 2 cos²(theta/2) -2 = 2 (cos²(theta/2) -1 )= -2 sin²(theta/2).

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

[ -2 sin²(theta/2) ] * cos(theta/2) + [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2 )

= -2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2) + 2 sin²(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

= 0.

Yes, so the equation holds. So the vector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is indeed an eigenvector.

But wait, wait. That's just one component. Because when you have a = cos(theta/2) and b = sin(theta/2), the condition is satisfied. So this is an eigenvector. But it's not necessarily normalized yet.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait! Let's make sure about the normalization. The norm is sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = sqrt(1) = 1. So this vector is already normalized. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but without the ħ. Hmm, but the options have some options with ħ, others without.

Wait the given options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, so if the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), then the correct answer would be option C. But wait, the problem statement says that Px, Py, and Pz are given as (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So the operator P is defined as having components proportional to ħ/2. So when finding the eigenvector, does the normalization involve ħ?

Wait, no. Because the eigenvector is a vector in Hilbert space, and the components are just complex numbers (or real in this case). So the answer should be option C, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But looking at the options, option C is the third option, which is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. So P is the operator, and the eigenvector is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check. The operator P·n is the one we're considering, and we found that its eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But, wait, let me think about the physical context. For a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvector for spin-up along direction n is |+n> = cos(theta/2) |up> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |down> ?

Wait, perhaps I missed the phase factor. Because in the case of spin, the eigenvectors can have a phase depending on the direction. So in this problem, when n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1.

Wait, but earlier, when I set up the eigenvector, I got (a, b) = (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's the same as option C. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me look at the other options. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like the spherical coordinates but in terms of theta and phi. But that's not the same as what we have here, which is theta/2.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), etc. But our calculation doesn't involve any sqrt(2/3) factors, so that's probably not the right answer.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ, which doesn't involve theta/2, so probably not.

So the correct answer seems to be option C.

Wait, but I thought the eigenvector components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but when I look back, that's the case when the spin is along the direction n.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the Pauli matrices. Let me think: The eigenstates for spin in the z-direction are |+> = (1,0) and |-> = (0,1). For a general direction, the eigenvectors are superpositions of |+> and |->.

Wait, another approach: The eigenstates for spin in direction n are given by 

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |+> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |->.

In our case, phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane (phi is the angle around the z-axis), so e^{i phi/2} = 1. So,

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+> + sin(theta/2) |->.

Which corresponds to the vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So that's exactly what we found earlier.

But the options don't have any mention of the phase, and all options except B have some ħ terms, but our eigenvector doesn't involve ħ because it's a dimensionless vector.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

So, that's exactly what we have.

But then why does option D have a sqrt(2/3) factor? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about normalization.

Wait, when we found (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), that's already normalized. So that's correct. But looking at the options, option C is normalized, so it's a possibility.

Wait, but the problem asks for the eigenvector of operator P along an arbitrary direction n. Wait, but the operator P is given in terms of its components. Wait, but in our calculation, we derived the eigenvector as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the options have other possibilities. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I built the matrix for P·n.

Wait, let me recheck the matrix construction.

P_x matrix: (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

P_z matrix: (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when n is in x-z, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² =1.

So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Which as a matrix is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Which is (ħ/2) times the matrix:

[ n_z, n_x ]
[ n_x, -n_z ]

Wait, earlier I thought n_z is cosθ, n_x is sinθ. So in that case, the matrix becomes (ħ/2) times:

[ cosθ, sinθ ]
[ sinθ, -cosθ ]

Which is what I did earlier.

So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n |v> ) = (ħ/2) [ cosθ a + sinθ b, sinθ a - cosθ b ]^T = (ħ/2) [ ... ].

We set this equal to (ħ/2) times the eigenvalue [ a, b ]^T.

Wait, no, no. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - λ I ) |v> = 0.

Wait, perhaps I should represent the matrix correctly.

If λ = ħ/2,

Then,

[ P·n - (ħ/2) I ] = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So each element:

Top left: (ħ/2)(cosθ -1 )

Top right: (ħ/2) sinθ

Bottom left: (ħ/2) sinθ

Bottom right: (ħ/2)(-cosθ -1 )

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ,    -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the system of equations is:

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1 ) b = 0

Wait, earlier I had a mistake in the second equation. Wait, the second equation when setting the bottom element to zero is (sinθ) a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0.

So from the first equation:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

From this, a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

As before.

Now, substitute a into the second equation:

sinθ [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) b ] + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (sinθ)^2 / (1 - cosθ) ) * b

Second term: (-cosθ -1 ) b

Multiply both sides by (1 - cosθ) to eliminate denominator:

sin²θ b + ( (-cosθ -1 ) (1 - cosθ) ) b = 0.

Factor b (since it's not zero):

sin²θ + (-cosθ -1)(1 - cosθ) ) = 0.

Let me compute (-cosθ -1)(1 - cosθ ):

= (-1)(cosθ +1)(1 - cosθ )

= (-1)[ (1)^2 - (cosθ)^2 ) + (1 - cosθ) - (cosθ +1)(1) )  ]

Wait, perhaps compute directly.

(-cosθ -1)(1 - cosθ) = (-cosθ)(1) + (-cosθ)(-cosθ) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-cosθ)

= -cosθ + cos²θ -1 + cosθ.

Simplify:

- cosθ + cosθ = 0.

So left with cos²θ -1.

Which is -sin²θ.

So,

sin²θ + [ (-cosθ -1)(1 - cosθ) ] = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

So the equation holds, which is why the eigenvector is correct.

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), as we found earlier.

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

Wait, but option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ), which includes factors of ħ. But why would the eigenvector include ħ? Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, as they are states in Hilbert space. So the components should be dimensionless, not involving ħ.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices proportional to $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to $n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

### Step 1: Construct the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (not used here),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} - \lambda I\right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]
where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$. Substituting $\lambda$, the matrix becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector components
From the first equation:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0 \implies a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]
Using trigonometric identities, $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we find:
\[
a = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]
Let $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ (to be normalized later). Then:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2), \quad b = \sin(\theta/2).
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2)} = 1.
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector and includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ involves $\theta$ and $\phi$ directly, which is inconsistent with the derived $\theta/2$ dependence.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector exactly.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces unnecessary normalization factors and includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
