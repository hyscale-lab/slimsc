Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and maybe some salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically negative because it's exothermic.

Alright, the question gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are different for each. Let me write down the given data:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I need to figure out how much acid and base I'm dealing with and then see which is the limiting reagent because that will determine how much neutralization occurs.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl. The formula is HCl, which is a strong acid. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume in liters.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's a strong acid too, and each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So the moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. OH- ions would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So the total H+ available is HCl's H+ plus H2SO4's H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but which one is the limiting reagent here? Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- will be the limiting reagent because it's less in amount. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

Wait, but what about the stoichiometry? Each mole of OH- reacts with one mole of H+.

So neutralization reaction would use up 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water.

Wait, but wait, the total H+ available is 0.28, so after neutralization, there's 0.08 moles of H+ left.

Hmm, but when calculating enthalpy of neutralization, I think it's the heat released per mole of H+ neutralized. So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, and that's where the enthalpy comes from.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ from the acid. So each H+ contributes a certain amount of heat.

I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. So maybe each mole of H+ gives off about -57 kJ.

Wait, but
