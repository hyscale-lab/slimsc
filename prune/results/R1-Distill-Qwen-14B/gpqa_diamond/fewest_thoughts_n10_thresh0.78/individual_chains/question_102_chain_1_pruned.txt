Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their interaction's developmental fate. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making the binding site.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector. So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand's under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the expression of the downstream gene without a full promoter, so it might only be expressed when the upstream gene is translated.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So, when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene (mCherry in this case) to be expressed. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP that Cre can still act on, but perhaps only in certain contexts or maybe in a way that doesn't recombine with loxP sites.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot uses actin as a loading control. So they probably checked whether the ligand and receptor are being expressed. But the main issue is when they bred mice homozygous for the construct into a wild-type background, then crossed them to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so using SOX10-Cre would likely activate the Cre in neural crest-derived cells, including maybe the cells expressing the ligand and receptor.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signal, which should come from eGFP. But they don't see it. Why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand is expressed in some cells and the receptor in others, but in this setup, the construct is bicistronic, so both should be expressed in the same cells. Unless the promoters are different. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong, constitutive promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So both should be expressed in the same cells. But paracrine might mean that the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, but the eGFP is on the receptor. Hmm, but in this case, the question is about why the eGFP isn't being expressed. Maybe it's not about paracrine signaling but expression.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see the green fluorescence under the microscope. But if the eGFP is not properly trafficked, like if there's a problem in the ER/Golgi pathway, it might accumulate. But why would the construct cause that? Maybe if the stop cassette wasn't removed, but the presence of Cre should do that.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is just a regulatory element allowing internal initiation. So I don't think enhancers are missing here. Unless the construct lacks necessary regulatory elements for expression, but the question says the vector was made correctly.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, when you have a stop cassette, the idea is that the ORF is in frame so that when the stop is removed, the eGFP is correctly expressed. So if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor, then when Cre deletes the stop, the frameshift could cause a problem. Or perhaps the stop isn't flanked correctly. Alternatively, the eGFP is inserted in a way that the reading frame is messed up, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the question says the vector has ligand at 5' fused to mCherry. The ligand ORF is under CBA. Then a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then the receptor is at 3', but wait no, the receptor ORF is at the 3' position, right? The ligand is first, then a stop cassette, then the receptor. Wait, no, the setup says ligand ORF is 5', fused to mCherry. So the vector is ligand-ORF + stop cassette, then receptor ORF with IRES. Wait, no, the ligand is 5' and the receptor is 3'.

Actually, the way it's set up: the vector is bicistronic, so the first gene is the ligand, followed by mCherry, and the second gene is the receptor with eGFP. But the stop cassette is in between the ligand and mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry only if the stop is removed by Cre. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, so it's expressed as a separate ORF, with eGFP at the end. But the stop between receptor and eGFP is in a lox2272 cassette. So if Cre is present, it should delete the stops, allowing expression.

Wait, but the setup is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic, so two ORFs in one mRNA. The first ORF is ligand, which is under CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP), fused to mCherry. Then after that, perhaps another stop cassette before the receptor ORF, which has IRES upstream. Wait, no, the vector is ligand ORF (under CBA), followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then the receptor ORF (under IRES), followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. Wait, that's not making much sense.

Wait, correct structure: The bicistronic vector has two ORFs in a single transcript. The
