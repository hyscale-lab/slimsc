Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That's the initial concentration. And the K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K here probably refers to the formation constant, right? So the formation constant (Kf) is 5e10. 

EDTA, I remember, is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. Or maybe more accurately, the complex is CaY²− where Y is EDTA. Wait, actually, EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, but under certain pH conditions, it exists as Y^4-. So the formation of the complex is:

Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²− 

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). But in this case, the solution contains the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which I think means that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, since the concentrations are stoichiometric. Wait, "stochastic" here probably refers to the stoichiometric ratio, so 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA.

So the initial concentration of the complex is
