Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about cosmology. Hmm, the question is about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at around 790 nm and the flux drops below that. I think that has to do with redshift because when light from a distant object is redshifted, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted one.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—could that be the rest wavelength of some emission line? Like maybe the Lyman-alpha line? No, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm. Or maybe it's another line. Oh, wait, the Balmer series in hydrogen—like the Balmer-alpha line? That's about 656 nm in rest frame. But the observed wavelength here is 790 nm. So that's longer than 656. So maybe the redshift z is (790 - 656)/656 = 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z is about 0.2.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right line. Alternatively, maybe the peak is due to the Lyman break or another feature. Wait, the Lyman series is in UV. But if the observed wavelength is in the near-infrared, that suggests a significant redshift. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The drop in flux at wavelengths less than 790 nm suggests that below a certain wavelength, the flux decreases. That makes me think of a Lyman limit or Lyman break. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that would be a redshift z where 91*(1+z) = 790. So 1+z = 790/91 ≈ 8.68, so z≈7.68. Wait, that's a very high redshift. But that would mean the quasar is at z≈7.68. But wait, that's so high; I'm not sure if that's right. Because maybe the drop is due to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6. Let's calculate that: 790 - 121.6 is 668.4. Divide by 121.6: 668.4 /121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z ≈5.5. Hmm, that's a very high redshift indeed.

Wait, but that doesn't match the drop in flux. Because above the peak, say at longer wavelengths, the flux would drop if we're seeing the Lyman-alpha forest or something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm) Lyman limit. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's 7900 Angstrom. So 7900 / 91.2 ≈ 86.5
