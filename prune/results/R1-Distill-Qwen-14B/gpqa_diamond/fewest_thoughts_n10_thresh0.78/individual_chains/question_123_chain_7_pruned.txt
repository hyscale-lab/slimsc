Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta and the distance it travels. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question says that a supernova occurred, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So we have two frames here: the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S) and the ejecta's frame (S'). The problem states that in S', the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But since S and S' are both inertial frames, I think this implies that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy, but in the opposite direction. So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s.

Wait no, wait. Because if from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s. So in S (Galaxy's frame), the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So the time experienced in S' is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S during that time. Wait, no, the distance traveled in S is what we're looking for. Because the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So I think this is a problem involving time dilation and length contraction, maybe. Or is it simpler because the speed is so high that relativistic effects are significant?

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second for easier calculations. 60,
