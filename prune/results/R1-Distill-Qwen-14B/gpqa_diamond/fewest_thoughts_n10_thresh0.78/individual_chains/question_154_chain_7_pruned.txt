Okay, so I have this problem where a chemist found an unknown white solid, and I need to figure out what it is using the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%. There's also a peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the molecular weight. But wait, the molecular ion is often the M+ peak, and sometimes you can get M+2 for isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance—about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So, if the molecular formula includes a Cl, we should see peaks at M and M+2.

So the molecular weight is 156. Let me calculate possible molecular formulas. Let's think about possible structures, maybe with a benzene ring because the NMR shows aromatic protons.

The IR data has a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretch. If it's broad and strong, maybe it's a carboxylic acid (which has an -OH group), or perhaps an alcohol. But wait, I also see a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1, but it can be a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be an ester or an acid chloride. For acid chlorides, the C=O is usually around 1770-1820 cm^-1. Wait, but 1720 is a bit low for that. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). That's a very downfield proton, probably an -OH. But in D2O, the -OH of a carboxylic acid would exchange and not show up. However, if it's a phenolic OH, it might appear around 5 ppm, but that's not the case here. Wait, unless it's an aldehyde proton. Wait, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but this is 11. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's an -OH in a different environment, like a strong deshielded environment.

Another peak in the NMR is at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet is coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe something like p-substituted benzene. For example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, each causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. But wait, in a para-substituted benzene, you usually have two doublets (if two substituents are para). Alternatively, if there's a substituent with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, then the ring protons would be deshielded.

Let me think about the molecular weight. 156. Let's compute possible molecular formulas. Suppose it's C8HClO2. Let's see: C is 12*8=96, H is 1, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Total would be 96+1+35.5+32=164.5. Oh that's higher than 156. So maybe not with Cl. Alternatively, perhaps without Cl.

Wait, the options include chloro compounds. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: (7×12) +5 +35.5 + (2×16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. Hmm, which is close to 156. The molecular ion is at 156 (100%), so maybe it's the M peak, but the M+ would be 156, but with Cl, we should see M+2 at 158 as well. The M+ at 156 and M+2 at 158 would fit with a Cl in the molecule. The molecular ion is 156 and 32% at 158, which suggests that the molecular formula has one Cl atom because 35Cl is 75% and 37Cl is 25%. So the M peak would be at 156 (35Cl) and M+2 at 158 (37Cl). Therefore, the abundance would be approximately 75% and 25% of the base peak. But the given peak at 158 has 32%, which is roughly a quarter of 100%. So that makes sense. So the molecular formula has one Cl.

Now, looking at the options, all except option C have Cl. Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Let me think about that. Phenyl chloroformate would be C6H5COCl. The molecular formula is C8H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (8×12) +5 +35.5 +32 =
