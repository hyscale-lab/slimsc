Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, giving different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! So the width Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ / τ. But wait, particles decay probabilistically, so the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width.

But wait, how do I find the decay distance? Oh, right, the decay distance depends on the particle's velocity and lifetime. The mean decay length L is approximately the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ. Since Γ = ħ / τ, then τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, units are tricky here. I think ħ is in units of GeV·s when Γ is in GeV. Let me confirm: ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is in GeV, the units work out.

Wait, but Γ is given in MeV. Oh right, I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is
