Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But in this case, it's probably a 2-dimensional space because I see dx² and dy² terms, which are two-dimensional.

Oh wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere is a term from hyperbolic geometry, right? Or maybe it's a term used in some other context. Or perhaps it refers to a sphere in a space with an imaginary radius, which would make it a pseudosphere.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric here. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a sphere in a 2D space described by this metric.

So the problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but the metric given is in terms of x and y, not in spherical coordinates. Hmm, maybe I should find the area in this space.

The standard area element in a 2D space is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Let me compute that.

The metric is diagonal, so the determinant g is the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²) for both dx² and dy². So determinant g would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait. No, in the metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², so the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2) dx dy. But since g_{xy}=0 here, it's just sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy}) = sqrt([32/(4-x² - y²)]²) which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

Wait, so the area element is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Hmm, but wait, 32 is 32, but when you compute the area, you integrate this over some region.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Oh wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the metric is in terms of x and y, which might relate to a sphere in some embedded space.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is given in polar coordinates. Because x² + y² = r², where r is the radial coordinate. So let me try to rewrite the metric in polar coordinates.

Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². Substituting into the metric, ds² becomes [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, this looks like a metric in polar coordinates. So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So this is a 2D metric.

Now, what is the geometry described by this metric? The coefficient of dr² and r² dθ² is [32/(4 - r²)]. So the area element in this case, as I thought earlier, would be sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. Which is [sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) * sqrt(32/(4 - r²)))] dr dθ. That's [32/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the area is the integral of this over the region where the metric is defined. But wait, the denominator 4 - r² must not be zero, so r² <4. So r can go from 0 up to 2.
