Okay, I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I need to think about all the steps involved here.

So, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Oh, wait, but wait a second. Ba(OH)2 is a base, so mixing acid and base would cause a neutralization reaction. But I think I have to figure out which acid and base are reacting and how much.

Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other.

I think I need to find out how much acid and base are present in terms of moles. Because the enthalpy of neutralization depends on the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So, for each mole of H2SO4, we get 2 moles of H+. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+. On the base side, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-.

So, first, I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me start with the acids. 

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since each mole of HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total moles of H+ from acids = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the amount of H+ and OH- will determine which is the limiting reactant.

So H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of water.

Wait, but wait, the excess H+ would be 0.08 moles (0.28-0.2). But in neutralization, any extra H+ would come from the excess acid, but I'm not sure how that affects the
