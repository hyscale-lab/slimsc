Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me think about each step.

First, toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid is a nitrating agent. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, and when it undergoes nitration, the nitro group typically enters the para position because the methyl is a strong activating group. So product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene, right? Wait, or is it meta? No, wait, methyl is ortho/para directing. But since it's a strong activating group, the nitration would likely occur in the para position. So yes, product 1 is para-methyl nitrobenzene. Maybe I should draw that structure for clarity. So benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group opposite each other.

Next step is treating product 1 with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is used for oxidation, especially in acidic conditions. I think when a nitro group is attached to a benzene ring and there's an adjacent methyl group, oxidation might occur. Wait, para-nitrotoluene. Oh, wait, the methyl group is attached to the ring, adjacent to the nitro group? Or opposite? Wait, in para-nitrotoluene, the nitro is at the para position relative to the methyl. So the methyl is at position 1, nitro at position 4.

Wait, when we oxidize toluene derivatives, the substituents can influence where oxidation occurs. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Oh, wait, para-nitrotoluene when oxidized with MnO2 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrotoluene when oxidized might form something like benzoic acid. Wait, but the position matters. Because if the methyl is attached to the ring, oxidation of the methyl group (CH3) would turn it into a COOH group, but where?

Wait, when a methyl group is attached to a benzene ring and is adjacent to a nitro group, would oxidation of the methyl to a carboxylic acid happen? Because the nitro group is a meta director, but for oxidation, perhaps the position is different. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group directs the oxidation. Hmm.

Wait, product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. So when you oxidize the methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene ring, under acidic conditions with MnO2, the methyl group (-CH3) would oxidize to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. So the structure would be benzene ring with nitro at one position and COOH at the para position.

Wait, that makes sense. Because oxidation of toluene (methyl benzene) gives benzoic acid. So in this case, the methyl is at the para position relative to the nitro, so when oxidized, the methyl becomes COOH at the same position, making the nitro and COOH groups opposite each other on the benzene ring.

Now, product 3 is formed by treating product 2 with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Acetone and NaOH under aqueous conditions—oh, that's a Claisen condensation or some kind of aldol reaction. Wait, no, wait. Product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, but benzoic acid can undergo various reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a nitro group para to the COOH. Now, when treated with acetone and aqueous NaOH. Hmm, acetone is (propan-2-one), and under basic conditions, it can undergo the benzoin condensation or some other reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack on the acid. But benzoic acid is a carboxylic acid, which is not typically reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless activated. Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like NaOH, maybe the acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate. Then, the acetone would have a ketone group. How would that react?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitro group is reduced, but no, the question says the steps are nitration, oxidation, then this third step. Or perhaps the nitro group is undergoing some reaction here. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced.

Wait, but product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid. Now, in basic conditions, perhaps the nitro group could undergo some kind of hydrolysis. Wait, nitro groups can be hydrolyzed under strong acidic or basic conditions. Nitrobenzoic acid under basic conditions—could it form something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid group is involved in a substitution. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think—what's another possibility. Wait, maybe the reaction is a saponification, but that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that involves aromatic aldehydes and ketones.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid, which in basic conditions could form a sodium salt. Then, when acetone (a ketone) is present, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, perhaps the acetone is acting as a nucleophile in some way.

Wait, another approach: looking at the possible products. The question is about the molecular symmetry of product 3. So perhaps product 3 is a molecule with some kind of symmetry that we can determine.

Wait, let me think about the reactions again. If product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid, perhaps the next step is something else. Wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced, but that doesn't fit with acetone and NaOH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the benzoic acid is undergoing some kind of coupling or forming an ester.

Wait, another possibility: The benzoic acid could undergo a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but with what? In acetone and NaOH, perhaps the acetone is acting as a nucleophile. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, the acetone might be acting as a solvent in a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid, which has a nitro group (a strong deactivating group) and a COOH group (also deactivating). Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I need to think of the reaction differently. Maybe product 3 is formed via some kind of nucleophilic attack on the nitro group. Nitro groups can be reduced, but under basic conditions, perhaps a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being replaced by something else. For example, in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups, which aren't present here. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is being hydrolyzed.

Wait, nitro groups can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. For example, under strong acidic or basic conditions, nitro groups can be converted into amino groups. Wait, nitrobenzene hydrolyzes to phenylhydroxylamine, and then further to phenylamine. But under basic conditions, perhaps the nitro group in product 2 (para-nitrobenzoic acid) is hydrolyzed to an amino group.

But wait, product 2 is para-nitrobenzoic acid, which is a benzoic acid with a nitro group para to the COOH. If the nitro group is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, perhaps the nitro (-NO2) becomes an amino (-NH2) group. So product 3 would be para-aminobenzoic acid.

Wait, but what's the structure of para-aminobenzoic acid? It's a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and an NH2 group at position 4.

Now, what is the molecular symmetry of this molecule? Let me visualize it. The benzene ring is symmetric. The COOH is at position 1 (let's say top), and NH2 at position 4 (bottom). Wait, that's across from each other. So the substituents are on opposite sides of the ring.

So the molecule is para-substituted with two different groups: COOH and NH2.

Wait, but symmetry-wise, how does that affect the molecule? The molecule would have a plane of symmetry that passes through the center of the ring, between the two substituents. So each substituent is mirrored across that plane.

Wait, so the symmetry group would be C2. So point group C2, because there is a two-fold rotation axis. But wait, the molecule has a mirror plane, and a C2 axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.

Wait, the point groups: Let me recall. If a molecule has a plane of symmetry (mirror plane), it's in the Cs point group. If it also has a two-fold rotation axis, then the group is C2h, which includes a mirror plane and a C2 axis perpendicular to it. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in the case of para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, like para-xylene (which has two methyl groups), the molecule has a plane of symmetry (mirror plane) that bisects the ring between the two substituents. So it has a mirror plane (σ) and a C2 axis perpendicular to that plane. Alternatively, the molecule may have a C2 axis and a mirror plane, leading to a point group of C2h. Or is it C2?

Wait, the point group C2 means that the molecule has a two-fold rotation axis, but no mirror planes. Hmm. Wait, no. The Cs (C-sigma) point group has a single mirror plane. The C2h point group has a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane(s) perpendicular to it. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the point groups.

Alternatively, let me think about the molecule. For para-aminobenzoic acid, the substituents are COOH and NH2 across from each other on the benzene ring. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that lies between the two substituents. So any point on one side has a mirror image on the other.

Now, what are the symmetry elements? It has a mirror plane (σ), which would make the point group Cs. But I'm not sure if there's more symmetry.

Wait, no, because the substituents are different. So a rotation of 180 degrees (C2) about the axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring (i.e., through the center of the ring) would swap the COOH and NH2 groups. But since they are different, that rotation would not leave the molecule unchanged. So that would not be a symmetry operation. Therefore, the molecule only has a mirror plane, making the point group Cs.

Wait, but I thought that in some cases, like when substituents are identical, a C2 could exist. But when substituents are different, like in para-xylene (two same groups), it's C2 because a 180-degree rotation would map the molecule onto itself. But in para-aminobenzoic acid, since the substituents are different, a rotation would not leave the molecule invariant, so there's no C2 axis. So the only symmetry element is the mirror plane, so the point group is Cs.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought that when there are two different substituents opposite each other, the molecule has a C2 axis. But in that case, the substituents would have to be the same. For example, in para-substituted benzene with identical groups, the C2 axis would make sense. But when the groups are different, the C2 would not be a symmetry operation because the substituents wouldn't map onto each other.

So, in this case, with two different substituents, the molecule has a mirror plane (σ) and no C2 axis. So the point group is Cs, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not para-aminobenzoic acid. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, product 2 was para-nitrobenzoic acid. Then, step 3 is treating with acetone and aqueous NaOH. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitro group is being converted into an amide group. For example, in the presence of a base, perhaps the nitro group is replaced by an amino group via some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is being reduced to an amino group, but that would typically require a reducing agent like H2 and a catalyst, not NaOH and acetone.

Alternatively, maybe the acetone is undergoing some kind of condensation with the benzoic acid. Wait, but I'm not recalling a specific reaction that fits here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by an OAc (acetate) group. But that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, maybe the benzoic acid is undergoing some kind of nucleophilic attack. But benzoic acid is not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. Unless it's converted to a carboxylate.

Wait, in aqueous NaOH, the benzoic acid would deprotonate to form the benzoate ion. Then, acetone, which is a ketone, could perhaps react with the benzoate under certain conditions. Maybe some kind of Claisen condensation? The Claisen condensation typically involves esters, though.

Wait, the Claisen condensation is between esters to form β-keto esters. The benzoin condensation is between aldehydes. Maybe it's an aldol reaction. The aldol reaction involves enolates attacking carbonyls.

Wait, if I have the benzoate ion (from para-nitrobenzoic acid in NaOH), perhaps it can form an enolate, which then reacts with acetone. But wait, acetone is a ketone, and the enolate would attack the carbonyl carbon of acetone, leading to a cross aldol addition.

But wait, the aldol addition between a ketone enolate and another ketone is less common. More typically, it's between an enolate and an aldehyde or another ketone with α-H. Let me think: in this case, the benzoin would have an enolate, and acetone has a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetate is acting as a nucleophile. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced with an OAc group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about the nitro group but about the benzoic acid group. Maybe the benzoic acid is esterified with acetone? But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but the ring is deactivated by the nitro group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is para-aminobenzyl acetone or something else, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the product 3 structure. If the nitro group is replaced by an amino group, then product 3 would be para-aminobenzoic acid. So that would have a benzene ring with COOH and NH2 groups para to each other.

The symmetry of that molecule would be a mirror plane between the two substituents, but no other symmetry elements. So the point group would be Cs, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that allows a C2 axis. Like, if you rotate 180 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But when the substituents are different, that rotation would not leave the molecule invariant. So, for example, imagine a molecule where substituents are on opposite ends: if you rotate 180 degrees, the substituents switch places. But if they're different, the molecule wouldn't look the same, so no C2 symmetry.

Thus, the only symmetry element is a mirror plane, making the point group Cs, which is option A.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with toluene:

1. **Nitration**: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The methyl group on toluene is ortho/para-directing, and the nitro group (-NO₂) attaches at the para position relative to the methyl group. This forms **para-nitrotoluene** as product 1.

2. **Oxidation**: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring is oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This forms **para-nitrobenzoic acid** as product 2, where the nitro group and carboxylic acid group are para to each other on the benzene ring.

3. **Reaction with acetone and aqueous NaOH**: Product 2 undergoes a reaction with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Under these conditions, the nitro group (-NO₂) is hydrolyzed to an amino group (-NH₂). This forms **para-aminobenzoic acid** as product 3, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 and an amino group (-NH₂) at position 4.

4. **Molecular symmetry of product 3**: The molecule para-aminobenzoic acid has a benzene ring with two substituents, -COOH and -NH₂, para to each other. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (mirror plane) that bisects the ring between the two substituents. However, since the substituents are different (-COOH and -NH₂), there is no two-fold rotation axis (C₂). Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is **Cs**.

**Critical analysis of options**:
- **A) Cs**: Correct. The molecule has a single mirror plane, making the point group Cs.
- **B) D₂h**: Incorrect. This point group requires multiple symmetry elements (e.g., a plane of symmetry and a C₂ axis perpendicular to it), which are not present in para-aminobenzoic acid.
- **C) C₂h**: Incorrect. This point group also requires multiple symmetry elements, which are not present.
- **D) C₃**: Incorrect. This point group requires a three-fold rotation axis, which is absent in the molecule.
