Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the mass of the products can be less than the initial mass because some mass is converted into energy, right? But wait, the problem says the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh, so there must be some mass defect and energy released as kinetic energy or other forms like radiation.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since they're moving, they have kinetic energy, and I need to find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy (T1) of the more massive fragment and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of that same energy.

Let me outline what I know:

1. Initial mass is M, with rest mass energy 300 GeV. So the initial energy is just the rest mass energy because it's at rest.

2. After fission, two fragments: fragment A and fragment B. Let's say fragment A is more massive than fragment B. The problem states that fragment A is twice as massive as fragment B in terms of rest mass. So if fragment B has mass m, fragment A has mass 2m. The sum of their masses is 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. Therefore, fragment A is 0.66 M, fragment B is 0.33 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So initial rest mass was M, but the sum is 0.99 M. So the mass defect is M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. That energy must go into kinetic energy and perhaps binding energy or other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe that's kinetic energy of the fragments and any other energy like gamma rays or kinetic energy, but the question is only about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.

But the problem says, "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M." So the initial nucleus's rest mass was M, and the two fragments after fission have rest masses totaling 0.99 M. So the energy released is the binding energy or the energy from the mass defect, which is (0.01 M) c², but in the problem, the initial rest mass energy is given as 300 GeV. Wait, no, the initial mass is M, and its rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. But the rest masses after are 0.99 M, so (0.99 M) c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV (because 300 - 297 = 3 GeV). So that's
