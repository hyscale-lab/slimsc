Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that notation better. Oh right, in the Lagrangian, I think it's written as L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, perhaps it's more like L(y) = -λ f f (y) [ῡ + X(y)] ψ_f(y)? Or maybe it's actually L = -λ \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the original term is written as L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). No, wait, that can't make sense dimensionally. Maybe I'm overcomplicating; perhaps the actual form isn't crucial for determining the decay modes, but rather the fact that X interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. They're asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

So, kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than half the mass of X, because each product must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So for X to decay into two particles, each must have energy ≥ m_fermion, so 2 m_fermion ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, m_fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the mass of the fermion must be less than half of X's mass because in the rest frame of X, the two fermions each have energy at least m_fermion. So 2 m_fermion ≤ m_X, so m_fermion ≤ m_X/2.

So m_X is 6 GeV, so m_fermion ≤
