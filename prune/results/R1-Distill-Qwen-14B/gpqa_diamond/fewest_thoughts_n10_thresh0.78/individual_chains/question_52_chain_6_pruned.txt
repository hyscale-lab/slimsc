Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

Astronomers are studying a star. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. The ratio of Ti atoms in two levels is decreasing. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i and n_j are the number of atoms in levels i and j, g are the statistical weights, and E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Ã…. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But I don't know if that affects anything here; maybe it's just extra info.

Wait, the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2. So, when there are spots, the ratio is lower. That would mean that when the star is cooler (with spots), level 2 is more populated relative to level 1. Because the ratio is n1/n2, a lower ratio implies more in level 2. 

Cooler temperatures usually lead to lower excitation. So if the star is cooler, the atoms are less likely to be excited to higher energy levels. So the lower level (level 1) would be more populated than the upper level (level 2) compared to a hotter star.

Wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. 

Wait, but the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when spots are present, they cover 40% of the surface. The overall Teff is 5500 K. I'm not sure if the presence of spots affects the local temperature distribution, but the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So maybe the star's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

But wait, the question says: when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere is considered to have a lower effective temperature when spots are present?

No, wait, that might not
