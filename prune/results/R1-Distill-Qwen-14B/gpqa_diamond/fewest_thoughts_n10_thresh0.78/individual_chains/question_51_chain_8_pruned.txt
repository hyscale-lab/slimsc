Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will adjust accordingly. Oh right, the sphere being grounded means it's connected to the Earth, so charges can move in or out of the sphere to maintain equilibrium.

So, when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. Because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be such that the inner surface has an induced charge of -q, right? Because the positive charges in the conductor would be attracted to the nearby charge q, leaving the negative charges on the inner surface. Or wait, actually, no: the induced charge on the inner surface should be -q because the conductor must remain neutral overall (assuming the sphere was initially uncharged). But wait, if the sphere is grounded, it can have a net charge. Oh wait, no, the problem doesn't say the sphere is neutral. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so any excess charge would flow to the ground. Wait no, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute on the outer surface. But in this case, when you place a charge near the sphere, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the region near the charge, leaving the outer part with a positive charge. But because the sphere is grounded, those excess charges can leave the sphere, so the sphere's net charge might not change much. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges will separate. The inner surface will have an induced charge of -q (if the external charge is positive), and the outer surface will have +q to balance, but since the sphere is grounded, that excess +q can flow away, so the outer surface ends up neutral? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this straight. The charge q is placed outside the conducting sphere. So, by the method of images, the conducting sphere can be considered as having an image charge inside it. But since the sphere
