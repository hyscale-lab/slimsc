Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato... That probably means the Co(SCN)_2 complex? Because dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands attached. So we're looking for the species [Co(SCN)_2]^n+.

Stability constants are involved here. Stability constants, beta, are for the formation of complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So each beta corresponds to a different complex. Let me write down what each beta represents.

The general formula for the nth complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^k+. The stability constant beta_n is the formation constant for that complex. So for n=1, beta1=9. That would be [Co(SCN)]^+.

Similarly, beta2=40 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, beta3=63 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and beta4=16 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Wait, wait. Wait, Co(II) is +2 charge. Let me think about the charges.

Each SCN- is -1. So when they form complexes, the charge on the complex ion would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- â†’ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}.

So for n=1, charge is 2-1=+1. For n=2, charge is 0. For n=3, charge is -1. For n=4, charge is -2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem defines the complexes as starting from Co(II) adding SCN- in a stepwise manner. Each beta is for the step-wise formation. So beta1 is the
