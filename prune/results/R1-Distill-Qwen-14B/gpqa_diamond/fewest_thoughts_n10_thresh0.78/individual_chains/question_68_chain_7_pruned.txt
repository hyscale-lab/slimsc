Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question is about a spin 1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes direction. Hmm, I remember that spin systems can be described using quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with magnetic moments and their interactions with fields.

So the setup is: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, I think I need to recall the basics of spin precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it tends to align with the field. But if the field changes, the magnetic moment will start to precess around the new field direction. The frequency of this precession is related to the strength of the magnetic field and the properties of the particle.

In the initial state, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned along Z. The magnetic moment mu is gamma * Sz. So in the presence of the B field along Z, the Hamiltonian would be something like H = -mu · B. Wait, no, the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is usually H = - mu · B. But in quantum mechanics terms, I think it's more precise to write it as H = - γ ħ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Or wait, maybe because mu = gamma S, so H = - mu · B = -gamma S · B.

Wait, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H = - gamma B S_z. Because B is along Z. So the energy levels are E = - gamma B (ħ/2) and + gamma B (ħ/2), because S_z for spin 1/2 is ± ħ/2. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |−z> with energies E_+ and E_-.

But then the field
