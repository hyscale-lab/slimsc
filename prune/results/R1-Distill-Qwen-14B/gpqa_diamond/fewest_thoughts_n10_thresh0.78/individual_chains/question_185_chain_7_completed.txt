Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Alright, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues are the possible energy levels. 

The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Hmm, let me parse that. σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ has components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are the Pauli matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's like a direction in space. The dot product means σ · n is the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n, right? So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

So H is a 2x2 matrix because the Pauli matrices are 2x2. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination like this, what happens?

Wait, I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli vector (σ · n) are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity, and their linear combination's square would be something. Let me think: (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), and the cross terms σ_i σ_j for i≠j would be iσ_k (but wait, no, actually, the cross terms are anti-commuting, so they'll have terms with i's. But when you square σ · n, all the terms except the n_i squared terms will cancel out because the sum is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + ... = 1. So (σ · n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy (λ)^2 = 1, so λ = ±1.

So the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Then, the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by this operator. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. So that gives us eigenvalues of ±ε. 

Wait, let me make sure. If H = ε (σ ·n), and σ ·n has eigenvalues ±1, then H's eigenvalues are ε*(1) and ε*(-1), which are ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I remember sometimes people include factors like ħ/2 when dealing with spin Hamiltonians. Like the standard spin in a magnetic field is something like -γ ħ B · S, and S is σ/2. So maybe I should think about that.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ, but in the spin operator, S would be (ħ/2) σ. So if the Hamiltonian were written as H = something involving S · n, then the eigenvalues would involve ħ/2.

But in this problem, H is ε σ · n. So it's using the Pauli matrices directly, not scaled by ħ/2. So the eigenvalues I found earlier, ±ε, should still be correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe in natural units where ħ = 1, but the problem doesn't specify. The problem states that ε has the dimension of energy, so perhaps it already incorporates any necessary constants. So the eigenvalues would be ±ε, as I thought.

So the correct answer is option B: +ε, -ε.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), as it can be shown that \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) satisfy \((\lambda)^2 = 1\), giving \(\lambda = \pm 1\).

The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\) is simply \(\varepsilon\) times the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), which are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Among the given options, the correct choice is **B) \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\)**, as the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are directly proportional to \(\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
