Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so this is a multi-step organic chemistry question, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Hmm, a bit challenging, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's happening in each step.

So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene derivative, I think. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, right? So this molecule has a substituent at position 7, which is a tert-butoxy group. So the structure would be a norbornene ring with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product formed is product 1.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromidesâ€”maybe it's a substitution reaction. Oh, because dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups. So perhaps a nucleophilic substitution is happening here. But wait, in what solvent? Hmm, at elevated temperature, so maybe it's a SN2 reaction, but the molecules are a bit complex.

Wait, the starting material has a tert-butoxy group. That's a good leaving group? Or wait, no, tert-butoxy is a bulky group, but perhaps in this case, it's acting as a nucleophile. Or wait, maybe the sodium iodide is providing iodide ions as nucleophiles.

Wait, the reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the 5 and 6 positions has a dibromomethyl group. So each is -CH2Br2? Wait, no, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) would mean that each of carbons 5 and 6 have two bromines attached to a methyl group. Hmm, so each substituent is a CH2Br2 group.

Wait, but
