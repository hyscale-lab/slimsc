Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I remember that IUPAC nomenclature for benzoic acids can be a bit tricky, especially with multiple substituents. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the molecule has a benzene ring. The main functional group here is the carboxylic acid, which is considered the principal functional group. So the parent name will be benzoic acid. Now, the substituents are all meta to one another. Wait, no, the problem says that a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group are all meta to each other. So I need to figure out their positions relative to each other.

But wait, the description also says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So the -COOH (carboxylic acid) has two substituents in the ortho positions. Also, para to the COOH is a methoxy group. Oh, and the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). Hmm, that's a bit to unpack.

Let me draw the benzene ring. Let's number the positions. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, since the substituents are meta, the carbaldehyde (formyl) and the cyano will be at positions 3 and 5, but wait, let me think. If all three are meta to each other, their positions are each separated by two carbons. So COOH at 1, the next at 3, and the third at 5? Or is it that each is meta to each other? That might mean that each substituent is in the meta position relative to the others. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem states that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is in the meta position relative to the others. So if COOH is at position 1, then the formyl (CHO) would be at position 3, and the cyano (CN) at position 5. Because 1, 3, and 5 are each meta to each other in a benzene ring.

But wait, I should also consider the other substituents. Ortho
