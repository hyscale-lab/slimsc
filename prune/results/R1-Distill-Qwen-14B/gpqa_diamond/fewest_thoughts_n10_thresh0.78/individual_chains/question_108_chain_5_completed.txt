Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see what I remember.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Also, m is small, which probably refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? Oh, right, for orbital angular momentum, m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. But here it says small values of m, so maybe m is zero or ±1 or something like that.

The task is to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, right? The Balmer-alpha line is about 0.486 μm. So that's the H-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition in the hydrogen atom, probably from n=2 to n=3 or something else, wait no, wait, Balmer series is transitions from higher energy levels to n=2. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha is from n=3 to n=2, so that's the H-alpha line.

First, let me think about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetic effect arises due to the interaction of the magnetic moment of electrons with an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -g * μ_B * m, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is usually H = -μ·B, which would be H = g μ_B m B, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the signs.

Wait, another approach: The Zeeman Hamiltonian for an atom in a magnetic field is H_Zeeman = -μ·B. And μ for an electron is μ = -g_l (μ_B) m, where g_l is the Landé g-factor for orbital angular momentum. Wait wait, but electrons also have spin, so maybe it's the spin that's being considered here. Oh, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is for the orbital part. Hmm, but in the context of paramagnetism, I think it's the spin that's involved because for paramagnetism, the magnetic moment is due to unpaired electrons, which relates to spin. Wait, but the question says it's the orbital m. Hmm, maybe the problem is referring to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the total magnetic moment including spin, but the problem states it's the orbital m. So perhaps we're dealing with orbital Zeeman effect.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is often associated with the spin-orbit interaction, but in this case, maybe it's just the orbital contribution. So, the Hamiltonian would be H = (e/(2m_e)) * (L · B), perhaps? Or maybe it's H = μ_B * m * B, considering that for orbital angular momentum, the magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m, and the energy is -μ·B.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the charge, ħ is the reduced Planck, and m_e is the electron mass. So, the energy term would be H = -μ·B = -μ_B m B. But since B is 1 Tesla, and m is small, let's think about the magnitude.

Now, I should compute the magnitude of this paramagnetic term H, and compare it with the transition energy ΔE. But wait, ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom. The Balmer-alpha transition is from n=3 to n=2, so let me calculate that ΔE.

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) * (1/n^2), but I can also express it using Rydberg's constant. Rydberg energy R_H is about 13.6 eV. So, ΔE would be E_2 - E_3.

E_2 = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -3.4 eV.

E_3 = -13.6 eV / (3^2) = -1.511 eV.

So ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = (-1.511) - (-3.4) = 1.889 eV.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the transition is from a higher state to a lower state, so the energy emitted is E_initial - E_final. So if the electron transitions from n=3 to n=2, ΔE is E_2 - E_3. Wait, no, the energy difference when moving from n=3 to n=2 is E_2 - E_3, which is (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But the magnitude is 1.889 eV.

Alternatively, I can compute the wavelength to find ΔE using the relation E = hc/λ. Let's see, because λ is given as 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. Let's compute that.

Compute ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (486.1e-9) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ approximately 4.089e-19 J.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so let's convert ΔE to eV:

4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but earlier calculation using Rydberg's formula gave me about 1.889 eV. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, let me recompute using hc/lambda.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
λ = 486.1e-9 m = 4.861e-7 m.

So hc = 6.62607e-34 * 2.9979e8 = approx 1.98645e-25 J·m.

ΔE = hc / λ = 1.98645e-25 / 4.861e-7 = 1.98645e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 4.086e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.552 eV.

Wait, but earlier with Rydberg formula, I got 1.889 eV. Which is correct? Hmm, maybe I messed up the Rydberg calculation. Wait, the Rydberg energy is 13.6 eV for n=1. So for n=2, E= -13.6/(2^2)= -3.4 eV. For n=3, E= -13.6/(9)= about -1.511 eV. So the transition from 3 to 2 is ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV, so magnitude is 1.889 eV. But when I used hc/lambda, I get about 2.55 eV. So which one is correct?

Ah, wait, 1/lambda equals the Rydberg formula: 1/lambda = R_H (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2). For Balmer-alpha, n1=2, n2=3. So 1/lambda = R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H (5/36) = R_H * 5/(36).

R_H is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1.

So 1/lambda = (1.097e7) * (5/36) ≈ (1.097e7) * 0.1389 ≈ 1.54e6 m^-1.

So lambda ≈ 1/(1.54e6) ≈ 6.49e-7 m, which is about 649 nm. Wait, but the given lambda is 0.4861 μm (486.1 nm). Wait, that's the H-alpha line, which is from n=3 to n=2, but the wavelength is 656 nm? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Rydberg formula. Let me think again. The Balmer series is for transitions down to n=2, so the formula is 1/lambda = R_H (1/2^2 - 1/n^2), where n > 2. For n=3, 1/lambda=R_H (1/4 - 1/9) = R_H (5/36) ≈ (1.097e7 m^-1)*0.1389 ≈ 1.538e6 m^-1. So lambda ≈ 6.5e-7 m, which is 650 nm, which is the H-alpha line. But the question says 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. Oh wait, that's the H-beta line. So, hydrogen's Balmer series lines. H-alpha is 656 nm, H-beta is 486 nm. So, H-beta corresponds to transition from n=4 to n=2.

Wait, no, wait. For H-beta, n=4 to n=2. Then 1/lambda = R_H (1/4 - 1/16) = R_H (3/16) ≈ 1.097e7 * 0.1875 ≈ 2.044e6 m^-1. So lambda ≈ 4.9e-7 m, which is 490 nm. Which is close to the given 486 nm. So the transition is n=4 → n=2.

Therefore, the energy difference ΔE is E_2 - E_4.

E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_4 is -13.6/(16) = -0.85 eV. So ΔE = (-0.85) - (-3.4) = 2.55 eV. Oh, that's why when I did the hc/lambda calculation, I got 2.55 eV. So the Rydberg approach was correct in that case. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the transition was from n=3 to n=2, I got 1.89 eV, but the given wavelength is 486 nm which is H-beta, which is n=4 to n=2, giving a ΔE of 2.55 eV.

So, now I'll proceed with ΔE = 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is H = μ_B * m * B. Wait, but what is the value of m here? The orbital magnetic quantum number can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. Since the problem states "small values of m", perhaps m is 0, or m=1. Wait, but for hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be 0, 1, 2, etc. For the ground state, l=0, but in excited states, higher l.

Wait, but in any case, m can be up to l, but for small m, maybe m=1 or 0. Let's assume m=1 for the maximum case, but perhaps the exact value doesn't matter because we're to find the order of magnitude.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the elementary charge (1.6e-19 C), ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and m_e is 9.11e-31 kg.

So μ_B ≈ (1.6e-19 C) * (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.11e-31 kg) )

Calculating denominator: 2*9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30 kg.

So numerator: 1.6e-19 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 1.687e-53.

So μ_B ≈ 1.687e-53 / 1.822e-30 ≈ approx 9.26e-24 J/T.

Wait, actually, I think I remember that μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. So that's correct.

So H = μ_B * m * B. B is 1 T.

So H = μ_B * m * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J/T * m * 1 T = 9.27e-24 * m J.

But m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For hydrogen, in its ground state, l=0, so m=0. But in excited states, l can be non-zero. Let's assume the electron is in a state with l=1 (p orbital), so m can be -1, 0, +1. So the maximum m here is 1. So if m=1, H would be 9.27e-24 J.

But wait, no, because m is a dimensionless quantum number. So the actual energy is μ_B * m, so for m=1, H = 9.27e-24 J.

But wait, no, wait. The actual formula is H = μ_B * m * B. So m=1, B=1 T:

H = 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So converting H to eV:

9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

Wait, that's about 5.8e-5 eV.

Comparing this to ΔE, which is 2.55 eV. So H is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is 2.55 eV. So H is much smaller than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to ΔE. So which is bigger? ΔE is 2.55 eV, H is about 5.8e-5 eV. So H is much smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the average value of H is much less than ΔE.

So the options are:

A) <H> = ΔE → no, since H is much smaller.

B) <H> much greater than ΔE → no.

C) <H> much less than ΔE → yes.

D) <H> > ΔE → no.

So the correct answer is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \):**  
   The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to the H-\(\beta\) line in the Balmer series. This transition involves the energy difference between \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 2 \) states in the hydrogen atom. Using the Rydberg formula, the energy levels are:  
   \[
   E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}.
   \]  
   For \( n = 2 \), \( E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \), and for \( n = 4 \), \( E_4 = -0.85 \, \text{eV} \). The transition energy is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = E_2 - E_4 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} - (-0.85 \, \text{eV}) = 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term \( \langle H \rangle \):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \mu_B \cdot m \cdot B,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For small values of \( m \), such as \( m = 1 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = (9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \, \text{T} = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle = \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Clearly, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Analysis of Options:**  
- **A)** \( \langle H \rangle = \Delta E \): Incorrect, as \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \).  
- **B)** \( \langle H \rangle \gg \Delta E \): Incorrect, as \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \).  
- **C)** \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \): Correct, as \( \langle H \rangle \) is orders of magnitude smaller than \( \Delta E \).  
- **D)** \( \langle H \rangle > \Delta E \): Incorrect, as \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \).

**Answer: C**
