Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Wait, but wait, the problem gives specific concentrations and volumes, so I probably need to calculate the amount of H+ and OH- ions involved.

Let me look at the given solutions:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but I think it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions.
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base; each mole gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

Wait, but when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. So I need to find out the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Calculating moles for each:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl. Since it's HCl, moles of H+ is 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so
