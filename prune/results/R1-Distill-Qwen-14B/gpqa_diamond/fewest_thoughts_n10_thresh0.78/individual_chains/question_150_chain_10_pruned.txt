Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO has the given NMR data. It's then reacted with three reagents in sequence: first NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. We need to identify the final product from the options provided.

Let me start by looking at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The data provided is:

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down, the general formula for organic compounds is CnH2n+2OxNy. So, for each degree of unsaturation, we subtract two hydrogens.

The formula can be adjusted for degrees of unsaturation (DoU) as follows:

DoU = (2n + 2 + x) - H - y)/2, where x is the number of halogens and y is the number of nitrogens. But in this case, there's no halogen mentioned, but there's a nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps another way: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The normal formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. For n=8, it would be C8H18. But our compound has C8H9NO, which is C8H9N O.

Wait, but for the purpose of DoU, let's calculate:

DoU = (2*(8) + 2 - 9 + 1)/2. Wait, because each N is treated as contributing a valence? I'm a bit confused, but another approach: Degrees of Unsaturation formula.

Each degree is one ring or a double bond. The formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens), so:

DoU = (2*8 + 2 - 9 + 1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2= 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond (1), and another ring or double bond, maybe. Or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR, the peaks at 6.98 and 6.51, each a doublet with 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split each other into a doublet.

Wait, no, wait. For a para-substituted benzene, each aromatic proton is a doublet. If two protons are next to substituents on opposite ends, perhaps in a di-substituted benzene, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, the two
