Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. Wait, what does that peak mean? Oh right, that's probably the Lyman-alpha emission line. Or wait, no, Lyman-alpha is in the UV, around 121 nm. Wait, the Lyman series is for hydrogen transitions. Let me think: Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, Lyman-beta is 102.6 nm, but those are in the UV. But wait, if the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength, it's redshifted. So maybe the quasar is moving away, and the emission line is redshifted.

Wait, 790 nm is visible light, right? So the rest wavelength for some emission line is shorter. Let me think: Hydrogen's alpha line is 656 nm in the rest frame (that's the Balmer series, right?), which is red. Wait no, wait: The Balmer series is for transitions to n=2, so the first line is 656 nm (red), then 486 (blue-green), then 434, etc. But 790 is longer than 656, so if the observed wavelength is 790, that implies a redshift.

So the formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. So if the rest is 656 nm, and observed is 790, then z = (790/656) -1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 656 is approximately 1.204. So 1.204 minus 1 is 0.204. So z is about 0.2.

Wait, but if the observed wavelength is 790, and the rest is 656, then z = (790/656) -1 = (1.204) -1 = 0.204. So z is about 0.2.

But wait, another possibility: if the observed peak is from the Lyman-alpha line, which is 121 nm. So if the observed wavelength is longer than that, like 790, then z would be (790 / 121) -1. Let's see: 790 divided by 121 is about 6.529. So z would be 5.529. That's a much higher redshift. But high redshift quasars are very far away, which would make their light take longer to reach us. But the question is about the comoving distance, which is a different concept.

Wait, but the peak in the spectrum is probably the Lyman-alpha emission line. Because quasars are often associated with strong emission lines, and the Lyman-alpha is a prominent one in the UV. But when we observe it in the near-infrared, that suggests a high redshift. So maybe that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the
