Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these multi-step synthesis questions can get really tricky. But I'll take it step by step and try to figure it out.

Okay, let's start by reading the question carefully. The problem involves several reactions, and I need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm.

The first part says that 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. Let me see, the first compound is a bicyclo diene. The dienophile would be the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, but that compound has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So each of those is a CH2Br2 group.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl). So that would mean each of carbons 5 and 6 has a CH2Br2 substituent. But wait, dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2, right? So 5 and 6 positions have CH2Br2 groups.

But wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile is something that can undergo the [4+2] reaction. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, so maybe that is acting as the diene. Wait, but the other molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is norbornene. Norbornene is a good dienophile if I remember correctly. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (like a double bond with electron-withdrawing groups). So in this case, the bicyclo compound has a diene, so it's the diene. The other molecule, cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is the dienophile? Or maybe it's the opposite. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, perhaps 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the dienophile. Because in the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile is usually something like a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups, which can activate it. The dibromomethyl groups are probably electron-withdrawing due to the electronegative Br atoms. So perhaps this molecule is the dienophile.

Wait, but then the other molecule is the diene. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is the diene, and the cyc
