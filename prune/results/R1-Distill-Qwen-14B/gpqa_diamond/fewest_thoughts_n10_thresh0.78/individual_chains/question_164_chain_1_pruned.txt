Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, right? And when they eclipse each other, we can use some formulas to find their masses.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2 they're 15 and 10 km/s. The question is by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. The formula I think is something like K = (v * M) / (M_total), where K is the semi-amplitude, and M is the mass of the star. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2 π G) / P )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe there's a simpler approach. I remember that the ratio of the masses is related to the ratio of the radial velocities. Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's orbiting closer to the center of mass. So if one star has a higher RV, it's less massive.

Wait, right, the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if system_1 has a primary star with RV amplitude 10 km/s and the companion 5 km/s, then the mass ratio would be M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. Because the more massive star moves slower.

Similarly for system_2, the RVs are 15 and 10. So the mass ratio is M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈0.666... Wait, no, wait. The primary eclipse is when the hotter (more massive) star is eclipsed by the less massive one. Or wait, no, primary eclipse is when the larger or brighter star is eclipsed. But maybe that's not important here. What matters is the velocity
