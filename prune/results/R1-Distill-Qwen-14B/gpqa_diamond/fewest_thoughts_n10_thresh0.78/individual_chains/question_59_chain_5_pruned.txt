Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem is: We have three solutions mixed together. The first is 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Then, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, which is a strong acid. And finally, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, a strong base. We need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, right. When you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first step is probably to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution and see what the net is. Oh wait, but wait! Acetic acid is a weak acid, so its dissociation is different. Let me break it down.

First, let's calculate the total volume of the mixture. 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters. That'll be useful for finding concentrations later.

Now, let's find moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH (acetic acid). It's 0.1 M in 0.5 L. So moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. So it contributes some H+ ions, but not all.

Next, HCl. It's a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. The concentration is 0.2 M in 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+ ion, so 0.08 moles H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so total OH- moles are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, so let me think about the reaction between acids and bases. H+ and OH- will neutralize each other to form water. So, the total H+ is from CH3COOH and HCl. The OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

Let me compute the total H+ first. The HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+. The acetic acid, which is 0.05 moles, but as a weak acid, it won't give all the H+. Hmm, but wait, when we mix everything, will the presence of strong acid affect the acetic acid's dissociation? I think so. Because in presence of a strong acid, the H+ concentration is high, which can suppress the dissociation of the weak acid. But wait, maybe for the purpose of this problem, since HCl is a strong acid, it will
