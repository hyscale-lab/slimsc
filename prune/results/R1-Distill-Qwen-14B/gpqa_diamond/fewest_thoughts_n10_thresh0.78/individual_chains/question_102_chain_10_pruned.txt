Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, particularly involving a bicistronic vector and Cre-Lox systems. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the setup: They're studying a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. So, the question is about why, after breeding and testing, they don't see a green signal under the confocal microscope.

The vector they used is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which is a regulatory element that allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated as a separate protein after the ligand. 

Now, the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. Cre can cause recombination between loxP sites. The loxP-stop-loxP would block expression unless Cre is present to excise the stop. Similarly, lox2272 is another site, but I think it's a variant or a different strain of the system. Wait, lox2272 is a loxP variant that's orthogonal, meaning it doesn't recombine with loxP. So, in this construct, the ligand's stop is between it and mCherry under loxP, and the receptor's stop is under lox2272.

They used a Cre system. The mice are homozygous for the construct in the wildtype background. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is likely expressed in neural crest cells.

In the offspring, they're looking for green signal, which should be from eGFP on the receptor. But they don't see it. Why?

Looking at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how this relates to the expression in the vector. The construct would presumably express both ligand and receptor, but if they're paracrine, maybe the ligand acts on the same cells? Not sure how this would affect the Western blot or GFP expression.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is stuck, eGFP wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see the green signal in the confocal. But why would that happen? Maybe because of a stop codon or incorrect frame. But the vector has an IRES, which usually allows for separate translation. Unless the IRES isn't working, but this is after the stop is removed.

Option C: The enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. CBA is a chicken beta actin promoter, which is strong and constitutive. So perhaps the expression is not dependent on an enhancer, unless the CBA doesn't include necessary regulatory elements. But if the promoter is there, the ligand should be expressed.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF with a stop cassette. So, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed. If the eGFP is not in frame, that would mean that the fusion protein (receptor-eGFP) is not correctly made. Because the stop was before eGFP. Wait, the construct is receptor ORF fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, but there's a stop in between. So, the way it's written: receptor stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. No, the way the vector is described: the ligand is 5' with mCherry, then the stop, then the IRES, then the receptor, then eGFP, with another stop. So the vector is: ligand (CBA promoter) -> stop (loxP) -> IRES -> receptor (ORF) -> stop (lox2272) -> eGFP.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The setup says: bicistronic lox-Cre vector with ligand at 5' fused to mCherry, receptor at 3' fused to eGFP. The ligand is under CBA. The receptor is after an IRES. So the structure is:

CBA promoter -> Ligand ORF -> stop (loxP-stop-loxP) -> IRES -> Receptor ORF -> stop (lox2272
