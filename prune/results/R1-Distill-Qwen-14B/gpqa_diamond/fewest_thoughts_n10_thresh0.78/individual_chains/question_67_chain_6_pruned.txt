Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in p orbitals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbitals, and we're considering their orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things a bit. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1 (since p orbitals have l=1), and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. Right, so l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total orbital angular momentum l is 2, and the z-component m is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We want the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Hmm, orbital angular momentum operators are L1z and L2z for each particle. Each Li has eigenvalues m_i * ħ, right? So for each electron, the eigenvalue of Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1 implies m can be -1, 0, +1.

But wait, the state is a coupled state. So when the angular momenta are combined, the state is expressed in terms of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. To find the probabilities of measuring specific m1 and m2 values, I need to decompose the coupled state into the product states of individual m1 and m2.

Wait, the coupled state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. But I'm not sure how to express that as a combination of |l1,m1> |l2,m2> states. I think it's a Clebsch-Gordan expansion, right? Because when combining two angular momenta, the total state is a linear combination of the product states.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of |1,m1> |1,m2> such that m1 + m2 = M = -1.

Wait, but M is the total z-component. So for each product state in the expansion, m1 + m2 = -1.

So to find all possible m1 and m2 that add up to -1, given that each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

Possible combinations:
- m1 = -1, m2 = 0: sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1: sum is -1
Are there others? Let's see:
- m1 = +1, m2 = -2? No, because m2 can't be -2. So only the two combinations above.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum of these two product states. But how are they combined? The coefficients would come from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 and M=-1.

I remember that the coefficients can be found using tables or recursion. Alternatively, maybe the coupled state can be written as a linear combination of the product states |1,m1>|1,m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion would be |1,1,2,-1> = c1 |1,-1, 1,0> + c2 |1,0,1,-1>.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that notation. Each product state is |l1,m1>|l2,m2>, so for our case, l1 and l2 are both 1.

So the terms are |1,m1> ⊗ |1,m2>, with m1 + m2 = -1.

So the possible terms are |1,-1> |1,0> and |1,0> |1,-1>, as I thought.

I need to find the coefficients for these terms in the expansion of the |1,1,2,-1> state.

From what I remember, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2 are non-zero only for certain M values. Let me try to recall. For two p orbitals (l=1), combining to L=2 (which is d orbital), the possible M values go from L=2 down to -2, in steps of 1. So M can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

The expansion of |1,1,2,M> would include terms where m1 + m2 = M.

For M = 2: only m1=1, m2=1. So coefficient is 1.

For M=1: terms are m1=1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=1. The CG coefficient is sqrt(2/3) for each? Or maybe 1/sqrt(2), I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps for M=1, the expansion is (|1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1> ) multiplied by some factor.

But for M=0: terms are m1=1, m2=-1; m1=0, m2=0; m1=-1, m2=1. The coefficients vary.

Wait, but in our case, M is -1. So let's think about M=-1. The possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2=0.

m1=0, m2=-1.
