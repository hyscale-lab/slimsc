Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The problem is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue.

Wait, wait. Right, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized, and each state is described by the principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me think. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. But since the potential is isotropic, the energy levels are degenerate in certain ways. Oh right, the energy is given by E = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers, right? But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each direction contributes (nx + 1/2)ℏω for x, same for y and z. So the total energy is (nx + ny + nz + 3/2)ℏω. So the sum nx + ny + nz is the n in the formula, right? So n = nx + ny + nz + 1? Or wait, no, the sum is n, so E = (
