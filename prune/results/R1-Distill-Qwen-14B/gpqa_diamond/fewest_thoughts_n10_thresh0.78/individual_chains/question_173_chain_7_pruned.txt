Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Hmm, I remember Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. It says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but for the minimum uncertainty, I guess we can use equality, so Δx * Δp = ħ/2. 

But wait, the question is about energy. I think energy is related to momentum. Oh right, because the kinetic energy E is p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

So first, I need to find Δp. From Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Rearranging, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). 

What's ħ? I think it's about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. And Δx is given as 0.1 nm. Wait, nanometers to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters.

So plugging the numbers: ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9). Let me compute that denominator: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 = 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = approximately (1e-34)/(2e-10) = 0.5e-24 J·s/m. Wait, no, the units are a bit off, but the calculation is in terms of magnitude.

Wait, let me calculate the actual value. 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24, which is 0.525e-24 ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is about 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, to find ΔE, which is the uncertainty in energy. Since the electron's energy is kinetic, E = p²/(2m). But wait, if ΔE is the uncertainty, then maybe ΔE can be approximated by the derivative of E with respect to p, multiplied by Δp. So ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp.

E = p²/(2m), so dE/dp = p/(m). So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but p is the momentum. Alternatively, wait, since we have Δp, perhaps the minimum uncertainty in E would relate to p squared since E is proportional to p squared.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E would be ΔE ≈ (2p Δp)/(2m) )? Or perhaps I should use the variance formula. Alternatively,
