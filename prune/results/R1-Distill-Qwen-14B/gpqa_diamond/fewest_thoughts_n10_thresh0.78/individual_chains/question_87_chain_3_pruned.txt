Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The ring itself is 6-membered, aromatic, so maybe benzene or something like that. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. Hmm, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent is likely a single carbon group, but wait, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one? Or perhaps each is one carbon but each is a halogen? Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so one substituent is a carbonyl group, and another is a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the ring has 6 carbons (like benzene). So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Let me think. So the two substituents would be -O-R or something else? No, wait. The substituents are carbonyl (like a ketone or maybe an ester group) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone, aldehyde

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, I need to figure out what the structure of this compound is and then match it to the correct NMR spectrum from the given options.

First, let's break down what the information given means. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The ring is six-membered, which makes sense because benzene is a six-membered aromatic ring.

The total number of carbon atoms is 8. But wait, benzene itself has 6 carbons. So the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Hmm, but wait, each substituent could have multiple carbons. Wait, 6 (from benzene) + substituents = 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent could be one carbon each, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero. But no, because di-substituted implies two substituents. So maybe each substituent is a single carbon, but that doesn't make sense because then each would be a methyl group or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero? No, that doesn't make sense because di-substituted implies two substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me think again. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So benzene has 6 carbons. Then the substituents add more. Suppose it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents, each of which has a certain number of carbons. So the total is 8 carbons. So substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon, but that would mean two substituents each with one carbon, which could be, say, two methyl groups. But wait, each substituent is attached to the ring, so
