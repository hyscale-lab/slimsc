Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The ring itself is 6-membered, aromatic, so maybe benzene or something like that. But wait, the total is 8 carbons. Hmm, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Since it's di-substituted, each substituent is likely a single carbon group, but wait, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is one? Or perhaps each is one carbon but each is a halogen? Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so one substituent is a carbonyl group, and another is a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the ring has 6 carbons (like benzene). So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Let me think. So the two substituents would be -O-R or something else? No, wait. The substituents are carbonyl (like a ketone or maybe an ester group) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone, aldehyde
