Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let me try to piece this together step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The problem describes a series of reactions involving different chemicals, labeled A to H. My goal is to determine the molecular symmetry of E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

Let me break down the information provided:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Bright red product... that makes me think of something like copper(II) compounds. Maybe A is copper metal? Because copper can form various compounds, like CuO or CuS. Alternatively, maybe A is another metal. Wait, but considering the next reaction.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced when C reacts with D. Hmm, if C is a copper compound, what could D be? Maybe D is a halogen gas like Cl2 or something else. Wait, but let me think about the next point.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C is in the presence of water, it breaks down into A and two acids. If A is a metal, maybe the reaction is something like a metal oxide reacting with water to form a base and acid. Wait, but in this case, it's forming acids F and G. So perhaps A is a metal that forms a hydroxide which can release H+ ions. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide reacting with water.

Wait, maybe I should think about what C could be. Let's reevaluate. 

The first reaction is A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about metals reacting with something to form a compound. Copper metal (A) reacting with sulfur (B), which is S gas. Because when copper reacts with sulfur, they form copper sulfide, but I think that's more like Cu2S, which is black. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe B is another gas. Or perhaps A is another metal. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is Fe (iron), and B is S (sulfur). Fe reacts with S to form FeS, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is aluminum, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the product C. Bright red—maybe it's a compound like Fe2O3·nH2O, which is usually reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another thought. The first reaction produces C, which then reacts with gas D. When C reacts with D, it forms E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's think about E. Extremely hazardous—maybe it's a gas like phosgene, or perhaps something like sarin gas, but maybe more likely a common dangerous compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide, but that's maybe stretching it.

Alternatively, let's think about the third reaction: C + water → A + F + G. So, C is a compound that, when hydrolyzed, produces metal A, and two acids. If A is a metal, then perhaps C is a metal oxide. For
