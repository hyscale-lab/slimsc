Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think through each piece carefully.

Alright, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. Let's break down the problem.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like benzene with two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in ortho, meta, or para positions. But I don't think the position affects the molecular formula, so I can focus on the functional groups.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700 cm^-1. So, the compound has an ester functional group. Esters are usually R-O-C-O-R structures, right? Or wait, no, esters are R-O-C-O-R is an ether. Wait, no. Wait, esters are more like R-O-CO-O-R? No, no. Wait, no, wait. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So, the carbonyl is present as part of the ester group.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's see: the signals are six in total. Two aromatic H, two vinyl H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. No -CH2 signals. So what does that tell me about the structure?

Hmm. Let's think about the possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else. Or maybe both substituents are ester-related in some way.

Wait, or maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Because the NMR shows vinyl H signals. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting. So maybe there's a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, let's think about possible substituents on the benzene ring. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R or something, and the other substituent could be a vinyl group, like CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. But if it's attached to the ring, it's probably a substituent like a vinyl ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester linked to a vinyl group.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound has an ester group and a methoxy group. But no, the NMR shows CH3 groups, so maybe the substituent has some methyl groups.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals. There are two -CH3 groups. So that's two sets of signals for methyl groups. Each of these might be split into different things. Also, the absence of -CH2 groups suggests that there are no methylene groups in the structure. So, any substituent with methylene (like CH2) would be absent.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring must consist of groups that have either only CH3 or maybe something else without CH2.

Let me think about the possible structure
