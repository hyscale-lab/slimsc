Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

So the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but quantum states are usually represented as vectors with unit length, right? Oh, wait, maybe I should normalize this vector. Let me compute its magnitude. The vector is [-1, 2, 1], so the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the actual state vector is this vector divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by (-1, 2, 1). Got it.

The operators for P and Q are given as matrices. Let's write them down. 

Operator P has the matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, that looks interesting. Let me see. So P is a 3x3 matrix. What's the structure here? Maybe it's a Pauli-like matrix, but extended to 3x3? Not sure, but perhaps I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q first.

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
First row:1,0,0
Second row:0,0,0
Third row:0,0,-1.

So Q is easy to handle because it's diagonal. The eigenvalues of Q are the diagonal elements. So eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. That makes sense.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. Wait no, it's the other way around: someone measures Q just after measuring P. So the order is P first, then Q. But wait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P", so the measurement of Q happens after P. So the process is: measure P, get a result, then measure Q on the new state.

But wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if you measure P first, the state after measurement will be in an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

But the problem is to find the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. So which measurement comes first? The question says the person measures Q after P, so the sequence is P measured first, then Q. So what's the probability of first getting 0 for P, then -1 for Q.

Wait, actually, I think the way the problem is phrased is that when someone measures Q just after measuring P. So perhaps the order is P first, then Q. So the joint probability is the product of the probability of getting P=0, and then Q=-1 given that the state is in the eigenstate of P corresponding to 0.

Wait, but another possibility is that the system is measured first for P, then for Q, but the outcome is that P is 0 and Q is -1. So the probability is the probability that measuring P gives 0 and then, in that state, measuring Q gives -1.

So, the approach I think is:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Find the eigenvalue 0 of P and its corresponding eigenvector, because we're interested in the case where P is measured to be 0.
3. Then, compute the probability that the initial state is projected onto this eigenvector.
4. Once in that eigenstate, find the probability of measuring Q as -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the initial state. Let me outline the steps.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P:
Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me construct the matrix P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - Î»I) =
