Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let's try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's see.

The question says the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, column vector? So that's the state vector, I guess. Oh wait, wait—states are usually represented as column vectors in quantum mechanics. Right, so the state here is |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, wait a minute, states need to be normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of their components should be 1.

Let me check: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. Oh, but wait, the problem didn't mention anything about normalization. Hmm, does that matter? I think when calculating probabilities, we should normalize the state first. Otherwise, the probabilities might add up to more than 1, which can't be right.

So I think the first step is to normalize the state vector. How? Well, the norm squared is 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So each component should be divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector |ψ> would be [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

But wait, the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1)." Does that assume it's already normalized? Because if it isn't, then the probabilities might come out incorrectly. Hmm, maybe the question expects us to proceed without normalizing, but I don't think that's right. Because probabilities depend on the inner product, which requires normalization.

So I'll proceed by normalizing the state vector. So the actual state is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Next, the observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write down the matrix P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (
