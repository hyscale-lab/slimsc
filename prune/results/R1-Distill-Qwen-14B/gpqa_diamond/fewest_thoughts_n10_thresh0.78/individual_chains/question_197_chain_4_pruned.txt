Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually used in what's called the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? Wait, no. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Red phosphorus and HI might be involved in dehydrohalogenation or maybe in a substitution reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: they might be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that usually deals with carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, converting them to methylene groups. Or wait, isn't red phosphorus and HI used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups? Hmm, maybe the reaction here is the formation of an acid from an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps it's about elimination reactions.

But let's first look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will help determine what the starting compound is, which then will guide us to the product after the reaction.

Starting with the IR data:

- 3400â€“2500 cm^-1: This broad region suggests O-H stretching. Maybe a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is usually indicative of a carboxylic acid proton. Because alcohols typically have lower ppm values, like around 1-5 ppm, unless it's an acidic alcohol like phenol, which is around 5-7 ppm. So the 10.5 ppm in the NMR is likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes have peaks around 9-10 ppm, but that's for the H, not the O-H. Oh wait, the IR region is for O-H. So a broad peak in IR between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group. So if the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is a broad singlet, that's probably a carboxylic acid.

Additionally, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong absorption, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But since the NMR suggests a carboxylic acid, maybe the carbonyl is from an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the presence of a broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid) would have a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. Wait, but 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, confusion here.

Wait, more accurately: a carboxylic acid O-H is broad and around 2500-3300, which matches the IR data. The IR at 1720 is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. So possible functional groups: carboxylic acid (since O-H is present) and a carbonyl. But wait, a carboxylic acid already has a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is a substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. Because that's the typical region for -COOH protons. So the molecule has a carboxylic acid group.

Then, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid. So that's consistent.

Other IR peaks: 1610 cm^-1 and 1450 cm^-1. Those are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

Looking at the NMR data:

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Because the two doublets each have 2H, it's like two sets of protons, each as a doublet, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions. Let's think: if it's a benzoic acid, then one substituent is COOH, and the other substituent would be another group.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something else, perhaps an oxygen or another CH2.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Could be a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point or another group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H, which is likely a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a CH(CH2CH3) group where the methyl is next to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, like at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the structure probably has a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position. The substituent is likely an alkyl chain with branching.

Looking at the substituent: the NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the CH, and then a methyl group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and a terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet). Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Let me think: the substituent on the benzene is an isobutyl group. Because the NMR shows:

- The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) could be a methyl attached to a CH, which is part of an isobutyl group. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is the CH connected to the benzene and the two CH2 groups
