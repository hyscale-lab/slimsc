Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperatures. After that, there are a few more reaction steps, and finally, we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out the structure of each product step by step. Let me start by trying to understand each reaction.

First, the initial reactant: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta is a norbornene structure. So the molecule has a bicyclic system with a substituent at position 7, which is a tert-butoxy group. The structure looks like a norbornene with an oxygen attached at one bridgehead, connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next reaction: it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile. The dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene probably have leaving groups (bromides). I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction scenario. Because the starting material has a diene (the norbornene part) and the other molecule has dienophiles, maybe.

Wait, no. Wait. The starting material is a bicyclo compound with a diene. When a diene reacts with a dienophile, it forms a six-membered ringâ€”Diels-Alder reaction. But in this case, the reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a cyclohexadiene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group. So each of those is a -CH2Br2 group? Or maybe each substituent is a -CH2-Br group, with two substituents on the same carbon? Wait, the formula is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a methyl group where the CH2 has two bromine atoms. Wait, no, a dibromomethyl group would be CH2Br2, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have two bonds to Br and two H's. Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, maybe it's a -CHBr2 group? So each substituent is a -CHBr2 group, attached to the cyclohexadiene at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, but wait. If the substit
