Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is when a 1,5-diene rearranges. Oh wait, the question mentions two different reactions, so I need to figure out the major products for both.

First, let's look at reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, the structure must be a benzene ring with a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, which is then connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me draw that out: 

Ph-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)- something? Let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of the four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the substituent on the benzene is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, the but-2-en-1-yl is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a methyl on C3. So that would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Wait, no, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So if it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon, which is the CH2 group attached to the double bond. So, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The substituent is (3-methylbut
