Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly like the expected molecule, except there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, that makes me think maybe it's some sort of splitting, but the coupling pattern isn't the reason. So spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then looking at the LC-MS: it shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the mass is consistent, but the retention time is different. Wait, but the mass is the same, so it's not like it's a different compound. So maybe it's the same compound existing in different forms.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it was a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a lower molecular weight. The question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, so this might not be the case. Unless the precursor somehow has the same m/z, but that's less likely.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they would have the same molecular weight. In NMR, if the sample isn't chiral, the enantiomers would average, but if the sample is chiral, maybe the NMR would show different peaks. Wait, but if the molecule is racemic, a 50:50 mix, the NMR might not show splitting unless there's a diastereotopic situation. But in the case of a racemic mixture, the same proton would appear as a single peak because the environments are equivalent for each enantiomer. Unless the molecule has some other symmetry? Maybe not. Hmm.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure what this means. Double coupling might refer to a situation where the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, but that usually leads to a splitting pattern, like a triplet or something. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals. Wait, double coupling might cause a more complex splitting, but the problem says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So maybe it's not this option.
