Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time, given a moving charge. The charge is moving with some trajectory, and we're considering the fields at a point r. The key thing is that the time t is greater than the time tr, which I think means that the fields we're considering are retarded—they depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

I remember that for a point charge, the potentials are usually derived using retarded times because the effects of the charge's motion take time to propagate to the observation point. So the scalar potential V is due to the charge's position, and the vector potential A is related to its motion, specifically its velocity.

The scalar potential for a static charge would be V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, I think the expression might change due to the retarded time effect. Wait, no, the scalar potential is still often just that, but maybe multiplied by some factor because of the motion? Or is it more about the position at the retarded time?

Wait, the scalar potential in the case of a moving charge can be expressed as V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time. But in the problem, it's given that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the point r. Hmm, so r (the position vector) is the same as the origin plus d? Or perhaps d is the vector from the charge's position to the field point. So perhaps the distance between the charge at tr and the field point is |d|, which would be r' = |d|.

But wait, looking at the options, some have terms like (d c - d·v), which suggests a denominator involving a dot product. That might be part of the relativistic correction due to the motion of the charge.

The vector potential A is typically given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π something) multiplied by the velocity vector. So in the static case, A
