Okay, I'm trying to tackle this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. Dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and the selection rules dictate which transitions are allowed.

I think the standard selection rules for the hydrogen atom (non-relativistic theory) are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So, for a transition to be allowed via dipole radiation, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l can be ±1, and the change in the magnetic quantum number m can be 0, ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So, the change in n is from 3 to 1, which is a Δn of -2. But since dipole transitions are only allowed when Δn is ±1, maybe this transition isn't direct. Oh wait, the question says it decays via two dipole transitions. So it must go through an intermediate state.

So the decay path is |3,0,0> → (intermediate state) → |1,0,0>.

Let me think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state has l=0, so the first transition must change l to l ± 1. Since l can't be negative, going from 0 to 1 is the only option. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

The options give possible intermediate states as |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, |2,1,-1>, or another state (I think option D has |2,1,0> but maybe I should check the options again).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. So the first transition is from n=3 to n=2, and l changes from 0 to 1. Then from n=2 to n=1, l goes from 1 to 0. Both transitions are Δl=±1, so allowed.

Option B: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 →1,0,0. So first transition: n=3→2, l=0→1, m=0→1. Δm=+1, which is allowed. Second transition: n=2→1, l=1→0, Δl=-1. m goes from 1→0, Δm= -1, allowed.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. First transition: m goes from 0 to -1, which is Δm=-1, allowed. Second transition: m goes from -1 to 0, Δm=+1, which is also allowed.

Option D: The first part seems incomplete,
