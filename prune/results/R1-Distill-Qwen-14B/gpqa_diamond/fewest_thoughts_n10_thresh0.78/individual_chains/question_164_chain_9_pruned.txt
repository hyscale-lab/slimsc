Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. 

Let me read the details again. Both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are sinusoidal with amplitudes 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. 

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, we need to find the mass ratio M1_total / M2_total. 

I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses. The amplitude of the radial velocity is related to the mass of the companion. Wait, how exactly? Oh right, the more massive star will have a smaller velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star has a larger velocity amplitude.

Let me think about the mass function. Oh wait, the mass function relates the velocity amplitudes and the orbital period to the masses. The formula is something like f(M) = (v1^3 * P) / (2π G), but I think I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I remember that the mass ratio can be found using the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary divided by the primary. So q = M2 / M1. 

If I have the velocities of both stars, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the mass ratio. Because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So q = M2/M1 = v1/(v2). 

Wait, no, wait. Let's see. The center of mass condition says M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. And the velocities are v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. So M1/M2 = v2/(v1). 

So if system_1 has velocities 10 and 5 km/s, then M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a. Wait, M1a is the mass of the first star, M1b the second. So their velocities are v1a and v1b. 

Wait, maybe I should think of each system separately. For each system, the two stars have velocity amplitudes v1 and v2. 

So for system_1, v1 = 10 km/s, v2 =5 km/s. So using the relation M1a / M1b = v1b / v1a. So M1a / M1b = (5)/(10) = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. Which means M1a is smaller than M1b. Or wait, no: M1a is the more massive star because the velocity is lower. Wait no, wait: the star with the larger velocity is less massive. Because the more massive star moves less. So if v1 is 10 and v2 is 5, then the star with 10 km/s is less massive than the one with 5. Because M1a = (v1b / v1a) * M1b. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternative approach: For each system, the mass function gives the mass of the companion. But since we have both velocity amplitudes, perhaps we can compute the mass ratio.

Wait, the mass ratio q = M_secondary / M_primary = (v_primary) / (v_secondary). Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2. And a is proportional to v * P/(2π). So a1/a2 = v1/v2. So M1/M2 = v2 /v1. 

So for system_1:

v1 = 10, v2 =5. So M1's mass ratio is (v2)/(v1) = (5)/(10) = 0.5. So q1 is 0.5. So the primary has a mass 2 times the secondary.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: M1 is the primary, M2 the secondary. So the more massive star is the primary, which has a smaller velocity. So the secondary's velocity is higher. So in system_1, the primary has v1=10, and secondary v2=5? Or wait, no. Wait, no, wait, that's not possible. Because in a binary system, the primary is the more massive one. So if the primary has a smaller velocity, then the secondary (less massive) has a larger velocity. So in system_1, if the primary has a velocity of 5, and the secondary 10, the mass ratio would be M2/M1 = v1/v2 =5/10=0.5. So M1 is twice as massive as M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 0.5 M1 = 1.5 M1.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The velocity amplitude of each star is inversely proportional to their mass. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So in system_1, M1/M2 = v2/v1 =5/10=0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2 → M1 = M2/2. So M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. 

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think. The mass of the primary is M1, and the secondary is M2. So M1 is larger than M2 if the primary is more massive. Wait, no, no, if M1 is the primary, it's the more massive. So if M1 is the primary, then M1 > M2. Then, M1/M2 = v2 /v1. So if v2 is 5 and v1 is 10, then M1/M2 = 5/10=0.5. But that would suggest M1 is smaller than M2, which contradicts the assumption that M1 is the primary. 

Ah, so I must have mixed up the velocities. So perhaps in the data, the velocities are for each star. So in system_1, star A has a velocity amplitude of 10, star B has 5. So star A is less massive. So star B is the primary. 

Wait, maybe the notation is that in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5, but not necessarily which is which. So the primary is the one with the smaller velocity. So if primary's velocity is 5, the secondary's is 10. Then, M1 (primary) / M2 (secondary) = v2 /v1 =10 /5 = 2. So M1 = 2 M2. So
