Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two productsâ€”a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NOESY NMR shows a cross-peak in the major but not the minor product. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like. The dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated, so it forms an anhydride. Since the starting acid has a cis-alkene, the resulting anhydride will probably have a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected via an oxygen bridge, and the alkene is still cis.

Wait, the NMR data for the anhydride: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about that. The 7 ppm peak in 1H NMR is probably an aromatic proton, but wait, the anhydride is from a diacid with a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride? Because if it's linear, the protons might split differently. Wait, a cyclic anhydride would have an oxygen bridge, which would form a five-membered ring, right? Like maleic anhydride.

Wait, but maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Its 1H NMR doesn't show a peak at 7 ppm, though. Maleic anhydride's protons are around 6.6-7.7 ppm as a doublet. Wait, but the question says a single peak. Hmm. Maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks. So, in the 13C spectrum, we have two carbons. That suggests that the anhydride might have symmetry. Because if all the carbons were unique, there would be more peaks. So perhaps the anhydride is symmetrical.

Wait, if the starting dicarboxylic acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid, which upon dehydration forms a cyclic anhydride. Let me think. For example, cis-dicarboxylic acid with two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, but if it's a cyclic anhydride, maybe the structure is such that the two carbonyl groups are adjacent to each other, and the remaining substituents are symmetric.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows two peaks. One at 137 ppm and another
