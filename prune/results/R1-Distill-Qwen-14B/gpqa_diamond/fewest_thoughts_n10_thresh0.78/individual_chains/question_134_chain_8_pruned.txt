Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, so the question is: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when they mix three solutions — 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to find which one is correct.

Wait a minute, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is typically about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The standard value for strong acids and bases is around -57 kJ/mol, but this problem might not be standard because there are multiple acids and a polyprotic one involved.

So first, I need to figure out how much H+ and OH- ions are available from each solution because that's what determines the neutralization reaction.

Let me break it down step by step.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each HCl gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume in liters. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid, but it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So first, calculate the moles. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- moles are 0.2.

Wait, but wait, when mixing, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the total H+ from acids and OH- from the base will react.

So total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles (from Ba(OH)2).

So which is the limiting reactant here? Let me see. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles that will react will be the smaller of H+ and OH-.

Wait, here H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H
