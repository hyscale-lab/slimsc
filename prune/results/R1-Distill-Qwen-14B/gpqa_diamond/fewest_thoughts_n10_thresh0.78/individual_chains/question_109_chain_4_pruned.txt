Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (like two protons or a proton and a neutron) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about which partial wave is not allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle comes into play with identical particles, but in this case, the two nucleons are part of a bound system. Hmm. Oh wait, the problem statement says that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum.

So the initial state is 1S0. Breaking that down: the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 → S=0, L is S (but wait, the notation is a bit tripping me). Wait, no, the term is (2S+1)L, so the superscript is 2S+1. So 1S0: S is 0, L is 0 (because S is the orbital angular momentum letter? Wait, no, the 'L' part is the orbital angular momentum, like S, P, D, F. So in 1S0, S is the orbital? Wait, no. Oh wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L, where S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: the term symbol is written as ^2S+1 L J. So for 1S0, the ^2S+1 is 1, meaning 2S+1=1 → S=0. The L is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 0 (since S corresponds to l=0, P is l=1, D is l=2, etc.). So L is 0, and J is 0 as well. So the initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, total angular momentum 0.

So the NN system is in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0. Then they emit a particle X. So the initial state is NN in state 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0) and X is emitted.

Wait, after emission, the final state is the NN state plus the X particle. But X is emitted, so the NN is in a different state.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin of the NN pair is zero.

The question is about the possible partial waves. Each option gives a transition from the initial state to a final state with an emitted particle, and we have to find which one is not allowed.

So let's break down each option.

The options are transitions from 1S0 to another state plus a particle (p, s, etc. Wait, the letters after the particle are lowercase, which I think denote the intrinsic parity. Because particles have intrinsic parities: s for spin-0 (like pion?), p for spin 1 (like photon, but maybe here it's the spin?), but wait, no. Let me think. The intrinsic parity of the emitted particle X is given as -1. So the lowercase letters in the options probably denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the emitted particle. Wait, no, the options are written as, for example, "7D1 + p", where the p probably denotes the particle type (like pion?), but wait, the question says that the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So perhaps the emitted particle's spin and parity are relevant.

Wait, the problem says the term is 1S0, which is the initial state. Then, the NN emit a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0 (NN in that state), and the final state is NN in another state plus X.

The problem gives four options, each showing the initial state (1S0) and the final state as a term symbol plus a particle. For example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the final NN state is 7D1, and X is p. But wait, the emitted particle's parity is given as -1, so I need to check what the parity of each possible particle is. Or perhaps the emitted particle's spin and parity will affect the overall parity conservation.

Wait, the problem says that the X has intrinsic parity -1. So each emitted particle's parity is -1. So p, s, f, etc., perhaps correspond to different particles with different intrinsic parities. But wait, the options have 'p', 's', 'f' as the suffix. Hmm, maybe p, s, f are the orbital angular momentum letters of the emitted particle X. Because in the notation, after the NN term, the +p would denote particle p with orbital angular momentum l=1, but wait, no. Wait, perhaps each option represents the emitted particle as being in a state with a certain orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, perhaps the suffix denotes the spin of the emitted particle. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p
B) 1S0 →3S1 + p
C) 1S0 →3D3 + f
D) 1S0 →3P0 + s

Looking at the letters 'p', 's', 'f' after the plus sign. Maybe these are the types of particles emitted, like p for a pion, s for a sigma meson, f for a phi meson, etc. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps 'p' stands for proton, but that might not directly relate to parity.

Wait, the key is that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So each option's X must have parity -1.

But regardless, the problem requires that we use the conservation of both angular momentum and parity, and the Pauli statistics condition T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

So, let's approach this step by step.

First, the initial state of the NN system is 1S0: which is S=0 (spin), L=0 (orbital), J=0. So the total angular momentum is 0.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the final state is the NN in a state with some T, S, L, and J, plus X.

The problem states that the final NN state has T=0.

So, the Pauli condition for the final NN state is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Given T=0, then 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So for the final NN state after emission, their total spin S and orbital angular momentum L must be such that their sum is odd.

Now, to find which partial wave is not allowed, let's look at each option:

Each option gives the final NN state. Let's parse each.

Option A: 7D1. The term is ^2S+1 D J. So the D means L=2 (since D is l=2). The J is 1. Wait, but how do we find S (total spin) and L (orbital) from the term symbol?

Wait, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J). So for 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D, which is l=2. So S=3, L=2. Then, J is 1.

So for the final state in option A, the NN has S=3, L=2. So S + L = 3 + 2 =5, which is odd. So 5 mod 2 is 1 → T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = 5 +1 mod 2 → 6 mod 2=0. So 0
