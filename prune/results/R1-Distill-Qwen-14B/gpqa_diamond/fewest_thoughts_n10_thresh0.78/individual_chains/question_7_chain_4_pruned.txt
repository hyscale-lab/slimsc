Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The process is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. The task is to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Alright, I remember that CMB photons are low-energy, around the milli-eV range. High-energy gamma-rays, on the other hand, would be much higher in energy. When these two photons collide, they can produce an electron-positron pair if their combined energy is sufficient.

Wait, I think this process is called photon-photon annihilation. The key here is to find the energy where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this interaction. I've heard about something called the photon-photon optical depth, which determines the probability of such interactions. If the optical depth is large enough, the gamma-rays would annihilate quickly, limiting their lifetime in the universe.

So the lifetime is limited when the interaction rate becomes significant. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons (CMB photons in this case).

The cross-section for pair production (γγ → e+ e-) is given by the so-called Klein-Nishina formula, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here since those are high-energy gamma-rays. Wait, actually, for very high energies, the cross-section might scale differently. Maybe it's proportional to some power of the photon energy.

Wait, I think the cross-section for this process when the photons are highly energetic (like in the GeV range) is given by σ ~ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) * (E_γ E_cmb) / (m_e^2 c^4) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that for γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section increases with the energy of the photons involved.

Wait, let me think again. The cross-section for pair production from photon-photon collisions has a threshold. The minimum energy required for the process is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. So each photon needs to have energy at least equal to the electron rest mass, but since the CMB photons are much lower energy, the high-energy gamma-ray must have enough energy to meet this threshold when combined with a CMB photon.

Wait, the threshold condition is that the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2. But s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame, which is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Hmm, this might get complicated, but perhaps for high-energy photons, we can make an approximation.

Let me think: Let's say the high-energy gamma has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy E_cmb. Since E is much larger than E_cmb, we can approximate E ≈ E
