Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them based on the periodic shifts of spectral lines.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method's shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I remember is K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity of the star. But more precisely, K depends on (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3)))). Or something like that. Alternatively, I think the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ) but I might be getting that wrong. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between K and the orbital period.

Another approach: the RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * sin(i)

But since e is zero (circular orbit) and M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate this. So K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i)/( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, another formula I've seen is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But perhaps a better way is to find the relationship between K and the orbital period P. Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps the ratio of their semi-amplitudes (K) relates inversely to the cube roots of their periods.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

But since M_p for both is the same (Neptune masses), and M_star is the same, the ratio K1/K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3). Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/ P^(1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 = (7/5) K1. So (K2/K1) = 7/5.

But since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), the ratio K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Wait, let me think carefully.

Let me write K1 = C * (1/P1^(1/3)) and K2 = C * (1/P2^(1/3)), where C is a constant (since M_p and M_star are same for both). So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). 

We know K2 is 7, K1 is 5. So 7/5 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). 

We need to find P2/P1. Let me rearrange:

(7/5)^3 = (P1/P2) 

So (7/5)^3 = (P1)/(P2) → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, no. Let me write (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So cube both sides:

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer P2 is than P1. That is, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3. Let me compute that.

5/7 is approximately 0.714. Cubed, (0.714)^3 is about 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then 0.51 *0.714 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. That means P2 is shorter than P1 by about 36%. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, which is roughly 0.36. So the answer would be option A: ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the formula again. Because the Doppler shift is inversely proportional to the period? So if the RV semi-amplitude is K, and K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then when K is larger, the period P is shorter. So if planet #2 causes a larger shift (7>5), it must orbit with a shorter period than planet #1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? If P2 is shorter, that would mean P2/P1 is less than 1, so the answer is around 0.36, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (21.9 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P / day )^(-1/3) ) * ( M_star / M_sun )^(-2/3) )

But since M_star is the same for both, and M_p is same, the formula simplifies to K ∝ P^(-1/3). So K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → (7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1. Let me compute that.

5^3 = 125, 7^3=343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's about 0.36 times as long. Thus, the answer is A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \), for a given planet mass and stellar mass. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) corresponds to the inverse ratio of the cube roots of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{7}{5} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( P_2/P_1 \):

\[
\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{P_1}{P_2} \implies P_2 = P_1 \cdot \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \) is approximately \( 0.364 \) times \( P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
