Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves three different reactions, each of which is a sigmatropic rearrangement. The options given are A, B, C, D, each providing possible products for each reaction. I need to figure out which option correctly matches each starting material with its product.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The reaction conditions are H+ and heat, which usually suggests some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. Since the question mentions sigmatropic rearrangements, which involve the shift of a pi bond into a sigma bond, I'm thinking of something like the Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but maybe another type.

Wait, wait. What's the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? It's (CH3O)2CHNH2, right? Because ethan-1-amine is NH2CH2CH3, but in this case, both substituents on the amine are methoxy groups. So it's a dimethylamino group attached to a methoxy group? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe it's more like OMe groups attached to the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is HOCH2CH2N(OCH3)2? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. So that's a tertiary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine.

But then, the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3?
