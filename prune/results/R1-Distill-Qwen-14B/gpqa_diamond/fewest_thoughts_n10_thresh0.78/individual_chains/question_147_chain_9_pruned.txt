Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. Okay, it's about an annihilation process. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, no, the p is a proton and p̄ is the antiproton. So the products are these particles A⁺ and A⁻, each appearing twice.

The question says the antiproton is slowly moving, which probably means its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass energy. The mass of A times c squared is given as 300 MeV. And the task is to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm. So I think this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can consider that the initial momentum is mainly from the antiproton and the proton is perhaps at rest? Or is the proton also moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe we can assume the proton is at rest? Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is much lower, so the proton's contribution is negligible? Hmm, not sure, but maybe the proton is at rest.

Let me think about the initial setup. The initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let me denote the proton as p and the antiproton as p̄. So their rest masses are important. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², right? Because the proton rest energy is around 938 MeV. Same for the antiproton since they have the same mass.

So the initial total rest mass energy is (m_p + m_p̄)c² = 2*938 = 1876 MeV.

The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each has a mass of 300 MeV/c², so the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV.

Wait, but energy isn't conserved here because the initial rest mass is 1876 MeV and the products are 1200 MeV. That suggests that the initial kinetic energy must be converted into kinetic energy of the products. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial kinetic energy is low, and the products have higher velocities.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, they produce other particles, and
