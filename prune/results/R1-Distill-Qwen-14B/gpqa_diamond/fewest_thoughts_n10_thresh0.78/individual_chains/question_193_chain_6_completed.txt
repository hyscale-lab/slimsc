Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is parallax (plx) equals 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d.

The number of stars, let's call it N, varies as 1/(plx)^5. Wait, rewriting that, it's N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N becomes proportional to 1/((1/d)^5) which is the same as d^5. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. If plx = 1/d, then 1/(plx) would be d. So if N is proportional to (1/(plx))^5, that would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Or wait, the question says N varies as 1/(plx^5), so N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So like, how does the number of stars in a shell at radius r compare to the next shell? Because when you're dealing with volumes, the number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell. The volume element in spherical shells is 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in a shell depends on r to some power multiplied by dr, then the number of stars per unit distance (dr) would be proportional to r² times some other factors.

Wait, but in this question, the number of stars N varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So given that, and since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So in terms of distance, the number of stars increases with d^5. But wait, that's the total number of stars up to distance d. Because if you integrate the number of stars per unit volume, you need to consider the volume.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase. If N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, that's the cumulative number of stars up to distance d. But the question is asking about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So like, the density of stars in a thin shell at distance r.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the differential number of stars with distance. Because the question says "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

So let's think about N(r) as the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r. The total number of stars up to radius r would be the integral of N(r) dr from 0 to r. But the question is about N(r) itself.

Given that N_total (the total number up to distance d) is proportional to d^5, then dN_total/dd = 5d^4. But that would be the slope of N_total with d. But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, which is like the density? Or maybe it's the number per unit distance, meaning perhaps the surface density or volume density.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me approach it another way. The number of stars in a volume is given by some function of distance. If the number of stars per unit volume decreases with distance, but in this problem, the number varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So, number per unit volume is proportional to (1/(plx))^5. But plx is 1/d, so that's d^5. So the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because if number density increases with distance, that would mean more stars further away, which might not make sense, since in reality, stars are more concentrated in the galactic plane and maybe the density decreases with distance beyond a certain point. But this is a specific region of the sky, so perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between number of stars in a volume vs number per unit volume. Let's think again.

The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, for a given parallax, how many stars are there. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, for a fixed distance, more stars as 1/plx^5 would mean higher number as plx decreases (since plx is inversely proportional to d). So as d increases, plx decreases, so 1/plx^5 increases. So N ∝ d^5.

So the total number of stars up to a distance d is proportional to d^5. So the cumulative number increases rapidly. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, the number in a thin shell dr would be the derivative of N_total with respect to d. So dN/dr = 5 d^4.

But wait, another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is N(r) dr = (number per volume) * volume of shell. The volume of a shell is 4π r² dr. So N(r) dr = k * (d^5) * 4π r² dr. Wait, no, because if the number per unit volume is proportional to d^5, then N(r) dr = (k * d^5) * 4π r² dr. But wait, since d is r, because we're considering distance r. So substituting d = r, then N(r) dr = k r^5 * 4 π r² dr = 4 π k r^7 dr.

Wait, that would imply that N(r) is proportional to r^7. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the volume but only the number as a function of distance in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption is that N is proportional to 1/(plx^5) = d^5. So when you look at a region of the sky, you're looking in a certain direction, and as you go further, the number of stars increases with d^5. But that seems to imply that the number per unit distance (like per parsec) increases as d^4, because the total number is d^5, and the change per unit distance is the derivative, 5d^4.

Wait, no. Because the total number up to distance d is N(d) = k d^5. The number of stars between d and d + dr would be N(d+dr) - N(d) = k ( (d+dr)^5 - d^5 ). Expanding (d+dr)^5, the first term is d^5, so the difference is approximately 5 d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) at distance d is approximately 5 d^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to d^4. Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. Wait, but the question says 'per unit range of distance, r'—so it's r^4.

So the correct answer would be C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars up to a distance \( d \) increases as \( d^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To find this, we consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( r \), which corresponds to the derivative of the total number of stars with respect to \( d \). Since \( N(d) \propto d^5 \), the derivative is:

\[
\frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit distance at a distance \( d \) is proportional to \( d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars in the region of the sky changes with distance as \( r^4 \).

From the given options:
- A) \( \sim r^3 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is not cubic.
- B) \( \sim r^5 \): Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars up to a distance, not per unit distance.
- C) \( \sim r^4 \): Correct, as derived above.
- D) \( \sim r^2 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is not quadratic.

Thus, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
