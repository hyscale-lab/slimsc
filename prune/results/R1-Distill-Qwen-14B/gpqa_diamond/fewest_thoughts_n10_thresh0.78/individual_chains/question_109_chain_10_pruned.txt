Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and some quantum numbers. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, so T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are given as A to D. Each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to another state plus a particle, like 7D1 + p or something.

First, let me parse the initial state. The term symbol is 1S0. The general term is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1, so S=0. L is S in spectroscopic terms, which is 0, so it's an S state. J is 0, so the total angular momentum is zero.

Wait, but when they emit a particle X, the NN system will have new quantum numbers. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something else plus the emitted particle X. Like, the initial NN is 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN is in a new state, say, T, L, S, and J, and X has some properties.

But wait, the question gives options where the NN is going from 1S0 to another state, like 7D1, 3S1, etc. So each option is a possible final state of the NN system after emitting X.

The problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. Oh, right, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the parity of the initial state times the parity of X should equal the parity of the final state times the parity of the emitted particle. Wait, but wait, in the decay process, the parity of the initial state is the product of the parity of the final state and the parity of the emitted particle X. Because parity is conserved only if the product of the final parities equals the initial parity.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. The parity of a state with orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = 1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state (the NN system) multiplied by the parity of X should equal the initial parity. So parity conservation says:

Parity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_X.

So 1 = Parity_final_NN * (-1).

That implies that Parity_final_NN = -1. Because 1 = (-1) * (-1) is true. Wait, because 1 = (-1) * Parity_final, so Parity_final = -1.

So the parity of the final NN state must be -1. So the parity is (-
