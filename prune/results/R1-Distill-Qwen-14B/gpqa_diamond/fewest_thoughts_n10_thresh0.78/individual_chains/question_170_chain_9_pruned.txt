Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D. 

Hmm, right, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors. So here, the state is a column vector [3i, 4], but wait, in quantum mechanics, the state is often a column vector. So I think I should represent this as a vector with two components, maybe as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4], but I should check the notation. Wait, the question says (3i, 4), which probably is ψ = (3i, 4). But in quantum mechanics, states are typically written as column vectors. So I'll represent it as ψ = |ψ> = [3i; 4].

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Sometimes, the spin state is written as a row vector, but I think for the purpose of calculating expectation values, we need it as a column vector because the expectation value involves the adjoint (bra) and the operator acting on the ket.

The expectation value of an operator is given by <ψ|Ô|ψ>. So for S_y, we need the operator S_y. But wait, S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. I remember that the Pauli matrices are used for spin in different directions. The Pauli matrix σ_y is given in the note as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

But S_y is related to σ_y by a factor. Oh right, S = (ħ/2)σ, so S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

So, to find the expectation value, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Breaking this down, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

So first, let's compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>, then multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, but let's be precise. The state ψ is given as (3i,4), but I think it's a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4]. Then the adjoint (bra) is <ψ| = [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3, 4 ], since the complex conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the components are complex. Let me think. If ψ is (3i, 4), then as a column vector, it's [3i;4]. So the conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3, 4 ], because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, but wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i? Wait, no, wait. 3i is 3 times i. The conjugate would be 3*(-i) = -3i. Oh wait,
