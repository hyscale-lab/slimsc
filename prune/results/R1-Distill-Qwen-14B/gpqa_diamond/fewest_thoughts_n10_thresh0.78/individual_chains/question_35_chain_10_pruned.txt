Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's being asked. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). Here, a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

So the task is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. While doing that, I need to evaluate which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors involves solving the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues are the roots of the equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. 

Let me write down the matrix Ay. 

Since Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π), let's calculate that. S is given as:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

So multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, that's correct. So the matrix has zeros on the diagonal and off-diagonal elements with i and -i multiplied by h/(4π).

Now, to find the eigenvalues λ of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - λ I) is:

[ [-λ, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ]

Calculating each part:

The product of the diagonal terms is λ².

The off-diagonal terms: (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) 

Wait, the product is (i)(-i) * (h/(4π))^2.

i*(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes (1)*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant is λ² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 ] = 0.

So, λ² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * sqrt(1) 

Which gives λ = h/(4π) and λ = -h/(4π)

Wait, sqrt( (h/(4π))^2 ) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, wait.
