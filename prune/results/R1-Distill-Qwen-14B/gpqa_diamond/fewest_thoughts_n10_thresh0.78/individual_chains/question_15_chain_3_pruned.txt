Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me think. So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass? Oh, right, the question says they share the same masses. So mass isn't a differentiating factor here. The period is different though. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_1 has a shorter period, that means it's orbiting closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually implies a closer orbit, like how Mercury has a shorter year than Earth.

The host stars: the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with same radii. Hmm, same radii but different masses. So maybe one is a main-sequence star and the other is a subgiant or something. But for the transit probability, the star's radius matters because a larger star makes the transit less likely (smaller dip) but wait no, the probability is more about the alignment, not the depth.

Wait, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Also, the inclination of the orbit. Oh, right, the probability is given by the formula P = (R_planet / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3)) )) or something like that? Wait, maybe I should think about the formula correctly. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the distance from the star. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is roughly (R_star / (a * (1 - e^2)^(1/
