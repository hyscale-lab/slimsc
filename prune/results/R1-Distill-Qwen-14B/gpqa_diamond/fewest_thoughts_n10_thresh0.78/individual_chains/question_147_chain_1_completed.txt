Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles. The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, no, the question says it's an antiproton, so p is a proton and p̄ is the antiproton.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh right, when they say "slowly moving," that probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate things by neglecting the kinetic energy compared to the rest energy. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

The mass of particle A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are all in terms of c, so the answer will be a fraction times the speed of light.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I think I remember that in annihilation processes, especially when the incoming particles are at rest or moving slowly, the products will share energy and momentum. But since it's a collision between a proton and an antiproton, which are each other's antiparticles, their annihilation would typically produce energy, but in this case, they produce two pairs of particles: A⁺ and A⁻.

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is much less than 938 MeV. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving "slowly," which implies that its velocity is much less than the speed of light. Oh wait, but for a particle moving at non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So perhaps we can treat it as a non-relativistic collision.

But wait, the products are A⁺ and A⁻, each with mass 300 MeV/c². So each has a rest energy of 300 MeV. So four particles in total: two A⁺ and two A⁻, each with mass 300 MeV.

Hmm, but considering the initial situation: proton and antiproton annihilate into these two pairs. Wait, but wait—proton and antiproton have the same rest mass, but the proton is matter, and the antiproton is antimatter. Their annihilation would typically produce energy, but in this case, it's producing particles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider conservation of energy and momentum. The initial system has a proton and an antiproton. Assuming the proton is initially at rest, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Or wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, but it's not clear about the proton's state. Oh, perhaps the problem states that both are at rest? No, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity.

Wait, but the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving," so maybe both particles are moving, but the antiproton is moving much slower? Or perhaps the initial setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but that velocity is much less than c. Or perhaps it's a head-on collision? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an inelastic collision where the proton and antiproton stick together, but in this case, they annihilate into these other particles.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of center-of-momentum frame. Because the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me calculate their total energy and momentum.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the system's total momentum is approximately equal to the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. Because the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero, and the antiproton has some momentum p. So the total initial momentum is p.

Then, after the annihilation, the products must have a total momentum equal to p as well. So the two A⁺ and two A⁻ must have a net momentum of p.

But wait, the products are four particles. Probably, they move in some symmetric fashion. Maybe in pairs. Like two A⁺ and two A⁻ moving in opposite directions, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in a specific direction, maybe opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the A particles are moving in pairs so that each pair has opposite momentum, canceling each other's momentum. But that would make the total momentum zero. But that's not possible since the initial momentum is p.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the initial system as a proton (mass m_p) at rest and an antiproton (mass m_p as well) moving with velocity v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps v is << c, so we can approximate its energy as E ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v², and momentum p ≈ m_p v.

Wait, but the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton's energy is approximately m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The total initial energy is E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The total initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v.

After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV, which is much less than the proton mass (since m_p is about 938 MeV). So m_A = 300 MeV is about a third of the proton mass.

But wait, the initial rest masses are m_p and m_p, so 2 * 938 = about 1876 MeV. The products have four particles each of 300 MeV, so 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the initial rest mass energy is higher than the products' rest mass. So perhaps the products can be moving with some kinetic energy.

But the problem is to find the velocity of A. So perhaps we can consider the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the velocity of each A as v_A. Assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which might not be the case, but perhaps an approximation.

Wait, but that's not likely because that would make the momentum too high. Alternatively, perhaps two A+ and two A- are moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the A particles are moving in pairs, so two of them move in one direction, and the other two in the opposite. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) moves in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel each other. But that would complicate things, but perhaps in that case, the total momentum is zero, which is not the case because the initial system has momentum p_initial = m_p v.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again. The antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate the initial momentum as zero. Wait, no, wait: if the antiproton is moving, even slowly, it has some momentum. But if it's moving slowly, perhaps the initial system's momentum is small compared to the rest mass.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that since the antiproton is moving slowly, we can treat it as a non-relativistic process, so we can approximate the energy and momentum using non-relativistic formulas.

So, considering that:

Initial energy, E_initial = m_p c² (proton at rest) + γ m_p c² (antiproton's energy). Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly, so γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² (1 + v²/(2 c²)) ) = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²) * c²? Wait, no, wait. The kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v², so E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v²) ) = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

Now, after the annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles. Each A has rest mass 300 MeV, which is 300 MeV/c². So each A's rest energy is 300 MeV. So the total rest energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV, which is more than 1200, so there is kinetic energy in the products.

But to find the velocity of the A particles, perhaps we can assume that all four are moving with the same velocity. Wait, but that might not be the case because they are moving in different directions. Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but that complicates the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving in a way that their momentum vectors sum up to the initial momentum. Since four particles, perhaps two A⁺ and two A⁻, but their directions might vary.

Alternatively, maybe the annihilation leads to two pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions. So each pair would have a net momentum of zero, but that would mean the total momentum is zero, which contradicts the initial momentum. So that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I should model this as a two-body problem. Wait, the initial system is a proton and antiproton. After annihilation, four particles are produced. But four particles are hard to handle. Alternatively, perhaps it's treated as two pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions. So each pair has momentum p, and the other pair has momentum -p, leading to a net momentum of zero. But then that would require the initial momentum to be zero, which it's not.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is symmetric. Let me think, perhaps the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻, each moving in pairs, but their velocities are such that the momentum is conserved.

Alternatively, perhaps each A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions with the same speed. So for each pair, the velocities are opposite, leading their momentum to cancel. But with two such pairs, the total momentum would still be zero, which again can't be right because initial momentum is non-zero.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the total momentum is small compared to the rest mass, so maybe the products don't have much kinetic energy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be treated in the rest frame of the proton. In that frame, the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps in this frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity v.

The total initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

After annihilation, the products must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. So perhaps each A particle has the same velocity, but that's unlikely because they are moving in different directions.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this as a symmetric situation where two A+ and two A- are produced, each moving in pairs, such that their momenta add up to m_p v.

Wait, maybe each pair (A+ and A-) is moving in opposite directions, but with the same speed. So the momentum of each pair is zero. But then the total momentum of the four particles is zero, which can't match the initial momentum of m_p v.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of energy and momentum conservation, even if it's an approximation.

Let me assume that all four A particles are moving in the same direction, which is probably not the case, but perhaps for the sake of solving the problem, I can proceed.

Wait, but four particles moving in the same direction would have a large total momentum, which might not match the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are moving in a way that each pair (A+ and A-) has opposite velocities, so their momenta cancel. But then, how to get the net initial momentum?

Wait, perhaps each pair (like two A's) have some momentum, and another pair have the same momentum, leading to a total that's double that.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should consider that the problem is symmetric and all A particles have the same speed in opposite directions, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to model the situation where all four particles share the same velocity, but that would require their momenta to add up. But in that case, the total momentum would be 4 m_A v_A. And initial momentum is m_p v.

But then, the velocity of the A particles would be v_A.

Wait, but that's an assumption, but perhaps it's the way to proceed.

So, let me write the conservation equations.

Conservation of energy:

m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 ( (1/2) m_A v_A² + m_A c² )

Wait, but wait, the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy, which is rest energy plus kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m_p v².

So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles. Each A has rest energy m_A c² and kinetic energy (1/2) m_A v_A². So 4 times that.

So:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 4 * (1/2) m_A v_A²

Which simplifies to:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

Now for conservation of momentum:

The initial momentum is m_p v (since the proton is at rest, the antiproton's momentum is m_p v).

The final momentum is 4 m_A v_A.

So:

m_p v = 4 m_A v_A.

Hmm, but wait, that's assuming that all four A particles have the same velocity in the same direction, which might not be the case. But perhaps it's an approximation given the problem's setup.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

2) m_p v = 4 m_A v_A.

I can try to solve these two equations for v_A and v.

But I have two equations and two unknowns: v and v_A.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which implies that v is much smaller than c. So perhaps (1/2) m_p v² is much smaller than the rest energy terms. So maybe I can neglect it compared to the rest energies. That is, approximate E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But then, the problem is to find v_A, so perhaps the kinetic energy in the products is small compared to their rest energies.

Wait, but let's see. If the antiproton's velocity is small, then the initial momentum is small. So from equation 2:

v_A = (m_p v) / (4 m_A).

Since v is small, v_A would be small as well.

But wait, equation 1 with the approximation E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c²:

2 m_p c² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

Simplify this:

2 m_p c² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

Divide both sides by 2:

m_p c² = 2 m_A c² + m_A v_A².

Rearranged:

m_p c² - 2 m_A c² = m_A v_A².

v_A² = (m_p c² - 2 m_A c²) / m_A.

Wait, but m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So:

m_p c² = 938 MeV.

2 m_A c² = 2 * 300 = 600 MeV.

So,

v_A² = (938 - 600) MeV / 300 MeV.

Which is (338 MeV) / (300 MeV) = approximately 1.1267.

So v_A² = 1.1267 c².

Wait, but that can't be possible, because v_A can't be larger than c. So that suggests that the approximation where we neglected the antiproton's kinetic energy is invalid. Because we end up with v_A² > c², which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I can't neglect the kinetic energy term. So I need to include that term.

So, going back to the first equation:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

And from the momentum equation:

v_A = (m_p v) / (4 m_A).

So perhaps I can substitute v from equation 2 into equation 1.

So, v = (4 m_A v_A ) / m_p.

Plugging that into equation 1:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p [ (4 m_A v_A ) / m_p ]² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

Simplify:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p [ (16 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p² ] = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Which becomes:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) * (16 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Simplify the term:

(1/2) * (16 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p = (8 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p.

So the equation becomes:

2 m_p c² + (8 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Now, let's bring all terms to one side:

2 m_p c² - 4 m_A c² + (8 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p - 2 m_A v_A^2 = 0.

Factor terms:

2 (m_p c² - 2 m_A c²) + (8 m_A² v_A² )/( m_p ) - 2 m_A v_A² = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor the v_A² terms.

Let me write the equation again:

2 m_p c² + (8 m_A² v_A² ) / m_p = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Let me move all terms to the left:

2 m_p c² - 4 m_A c² + (8 m_A² v_A² )/m_p - 2 m_A v_A^2 = 0.

Factor terms:

(2 m_p c² - 4 m_A c²) + v_A^2 ( 8 m_A² / m_p - 2 m_A ) = 0.

Factor out the common terms inside the parentheses:

= 2 c² (m_p - 2 m_A) + v_A^2 [ (8 m_A²) / m_p - 2 m_A ) ] = 0.

Hmm, let's compute each part numerically.

m_p = 938 MeV/c².

m_A = 300 MeV/c².

First, compute (m_p - 2 m_A):

= 938 - 2 * 300 = 938 - 600 = 338 MeV/c².

Now, compute the coefficient for v_A^2:

(8 m_A² ) / m_p - 2 m_A.

= (8 * 300^2 ) / 938 - (2 * 300 )

= (8 * 90000) / 938 ≈ 720000 / 938 ≈ 767.3 MeV.

And 2 * 300 = 600 MeV.

So 767.3 - 600 = 167.3 MeV.

So the equation becomes:

2 c² * 338 MeV/c² + v_A^2 * (167.3 MeV) ) = 0.

Wait, but 2 c² * 338 MeV/c² = 2 * 338 * c² (MeV/c²) ?

Wait, meV is energy, so when you multiply by c², you get MeV.

Wait, no: 338 MeV/c² multiplied by c² gives 338 MeV. So 2 * 338 MeV = 676 MeV.

So the equation is:

676 MeV + 167.3 MeV * v_A² = 0.

Which would imply that v_A^2 is negative, which is impossible. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.

Hmm, perhaps the assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity is incorrect. Maybe I should consider that each pair of A particles moves in opposite directions, leading to a cancellation of their momenta, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two pairs, each moving in opposite directions, so that their momenta cancel. But then the initial momentum would have to be zero, which it isn't.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the process can be treated as a non-relativistic one. So, perhaps the total energy is dominated by the rest mass energies, and the momentum is small.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this approach. Maybe I should think in terms of the threshold condition. The threshold condition is when the products are produced with the least possible kinetic energy, which occurs when all products are at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: considering the problem in the center-of-momentum frame. Let's compute the total energy and momentum in that frame.

The initial system consists of a proton (mass m_p) and an antiproton (mass m_p) moving with velocity v. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v.

The total momentum is p = m_p v.

The total energy is E = m_p c² + γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v << c. So γ ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2 c²).

So E ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² (1 + v²/(2 c²)) ) = 2 m_p c² + (m_p v²)/(2 c²) ) c². Wait, no: wait, (v²)/(2 c²) multiplied by c² gives (v²)/(2 c²) * c² = v²/(2).

Wait, no, let's recompute:

E = m_p c² (proton rest) + [ m_p c² * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) + (1/2) m_p v² ] (antiproton's energy). But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, the energy is E ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

So, the total energy is E = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The total momentum is p = m_p v.

The center-of-momentum (COM) frame's velocity u is given by:

u = (p c²) / E.

Which in this case:

u = (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² ).

Simplify:

u = (v c²) / (2 c² + (1/2) v² )

But since v is small, the denominator is approximately 2 c².

So u ≈ (v c²) / (2 c²) ) = v/2.

So in the COM frame, the initial particles are moving with velocity u ≈ v/2 in opposite directions, but their speeds are small.

In the COM frame, the total initial momentum is zero. So after annihilation, the products must have zero total momentum.

So in the COM frame, the four A particles must have a total momentum of zero.

That suggests that their velocities are arranged such that their momenta cancel out. For example, two A+ might move in one direction, and two A- move in the opposite, each with the same speed, leading their momenta to cancel each other.

Wait, but the problem is to find the velocity of particle A, so perhaps each A has the same speed in opposite directions, so their momenta cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps in the COM frame, each of the four particles has the same speed but in different directions, such that their momenta sum to zero.

But perhaps it's easier to think that each pair (A+ and A-) has opposite momenta. So, for example, two A+ move in the +x direction, and two A- move in the -x direction, each with the same speed. Then the momenta of the A+ would be 2 * m_A v, and the A- would be -2 * m_A v, leading to a net momentum of zero.

So, in the COM frame, each A has speed v_A, and the momentum of each pair cancels.

Now, the energy in the COM frame must be conserved.

In the COM frame, the initial energy is E = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

The energy after annihilation is the sum of the energies of the four A particles, each with rest energy m_A c² and kinetic energy (1/2) m_A v_A².

So, the total energy in the COM frame is 4 m_A c² + 4 * (1/2) m_A v_A² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

Conservation of energy:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A².

But I still have two variables: v and v_A.

Wait, but in the COM frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the velocity u is zero. Wait, no, earlier I said u ≈ v/2, but perhaps for small v, u is negligible. So perhaps the COM frame is moving at u ≈ v/2, but since v is small, u is much smaller than c.

Alternatively, perhaps in the COM frame, the initial particles are at rest. Wait, that's not possible because the antiproton is moving.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the total energy in the COM frame.

Wait, the COM energy is given by sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the proton and antiproton, and p1 and p2 are their momenta. Since the proton is at rest, p1 = 0, and E1 = m_p c². The antiproton has p2 = m_p v and E2 = m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

So the COM energy squared is:

(E1 + E2)^2 - (p2 c)^2 = [ (m_p c²) + (m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v²) ) ]^2 - [ (m_p v) c ]^2.

Expanding this:

= [ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² ]^2 - [ m_p² v² c² ].

Expanding the square:

= 4 m_p² c^4 + 2 * 2 m_p c² * (1/2 m_p v²) ) + (1/2 m_p v²)^2 - m_p^2 v² c².

Wait, no, the expansion is (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So, a = 2 m_p c², b = (1/2) m_p v².

So,

= (2 m_p c²)^2 + 2*(2 m_p c²)(1/2 m_p v²) ) + (1/2 m_p v²)^2 - (m_p^2 v^2 c^2).

Which is:

= 4 m_p^2 c^4 + 2 m_p c² * (1/2 m_p v² ) + (1/4 m_p² v^4) - m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

Simplify each term:

= 4 m_p² c^4 + m_p^2 c² v² + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4) - m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

Combine like terms:

The m_p^2 c² v² and -m_p^2 c² v² cancel each other.

So we have:

= 4 m_p² c^4 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4).

So the COM energy squared is 4 m_p² c^4 + (1/4) m_p^2 v^4.

Taking the square root:

E_com = sqrt(4 m_p² c^4 + (1/4) m_p^2 v^4 ) 

= m_p c² sqrt(4 + (v^4)/(4 c^4)).

But since v is small, v^4/(4 c^4) is negligible, so E_com ≈ m_p c² * 2 = 2 m_p c².

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Let me think again about the problem.

The products are four A particles. Each with rest mass 300 MeV. So the total rest energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. The initial rest energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV, so the initial system has more rest energy. So after the annihilation, the A particles will have some kinetic energy.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I should consider that in the COM frame, the A particles are at rest, but that can't be because the initial system has more energy than just the rest energy of the products.

Wait, perhaps I should make some approximation. Since the mass of A is much smaller than that of the proton, maybe I can approximate something.

Wait, m_p is about 938 MeV, m_A is 300 MeV. So m_A is roughly a third of m_p.

Hmm. Maybe I can consider that the kinetic energy of the A particles is much smaller than their rest energy, so their motion is non-relativistic.

So, for each A, E ≈ m_A c² + (1/2) m_A v_A².

But then, considering four particles, the total energy would be 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Wait, because each pair would have two particles, each with (1/2 m_A v_A^2) kinetic energy, so 2 * (1/2 m_A v_A^2) per pair, and two pairs makes 2 m_A v_A^2.

Wait, perhaps that's the way to proceed.

So, from energy conservation in the lab frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving):

E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v^2.

E_final = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2.

Momentum conservation:

p_initial = m_p v.

p_final = 4 m_A v_A.

But since the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps v is very small, so m_p v is small compared to m_p c. So, let's think about the case where the initial momentum is small, and the A particles have velocities close to some fraction of c, but perhaps we can find an expression.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to make an approximation. Let's assume that v is very small, so that v_A is approximately (m_p v)/(4 m_A), from the momentum equation.

So, v_A ≈ (m_p / (4 m_A)) v.

Now, substituting this into the energy equation.

E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

E_final = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A ( (m_p v)/(4 m_A))^2.

Simplify E_final:

4 m_A c² + 2 m_A * (m_p^2 v^2) / (16 m_A^2) )

= 4 m_A c² + (2 m_p^2 v^2 )/( 16 m_A )

= 4 m_A c² + (m_p^2 v^2 )/( 8 m_A ).

Set E_initial = E_final:

2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² = 4 m_A c² + (m_p^2 v^2 )/( 8 m_A )

Multiply both sides by 8 m_A to eliminate denominators:

16 m_p m_A c² + 4 m_p m_A v² = 32 m_A^2 c² + m_p^2 v^2.

Bring all terms to one side:

16 m_p m_A c² - 32 m_A^2 c² + [4 m_p m_A v² - m_p^2 v^2] = 0.

Factor:

16 m_A c² (m_p - 2 m_A ) + v^2 [4 m_p m_A - m_p^2 ] = 0.

Hmm, let's compute each term.

m_p = 938 MeV/c², m_A = 300 MeV/c².

m_p - 2 m_A = 938 - 600 = 338 MeV/c².

4 m_p m_A - m_p^2 = m_p (4 m_A - m_p) ) = 938 (1200 - 938) ) = 938 * 262 ≈ 246,  938 * 262 = 938 * 200=187600, 938 *60=56280, 938*2=1876 → 187600+56280=243880 +1876=245,756 MeV²/c^4.

So now, the equation becomes:

16 * 300 * c² * 338 + v² * (245756) * c² = 0.

Wait, but both terms are positive, which would make the sum positive, but the equation equals zero. That can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when moving terms around. Let me recheck.

Wait, the equation after moving all terms to the left side:

16 m_p m_A c² -32 m_A² c² +4 m_p m_A v² - m_p^2 v² = 0.

Hmm, factor terms:

(16 m_p m_A c² -32 m_A² c²) + (4 m_p m_A v² - m_p² v²) = 0.

Factor out 16 m_A c² (m_p/2 - 2 m_A) ?

Wait, perhaps factor 16 m_A c² (m_p - 2 m_A) ?

Wait, let's compute:

16 m_p m_A c² -32 m_A² c² = 16 m_A c² (m_p - 2 m_A) )

Similarly,

4 m_p m_A v² - m_p² v² = v² (4 m_A - m_p ) m_p.

Hmm, so:

16 m_A c² (m_p - 2 m_A) ) + v² m_p (4 m_A - m_p ) ) = 0.

Now, plug in the values:

m_p - 2 m_A = 338 MeV/c².

4 m_A - m_p = 1200 - 938 = 262 MeV/c².

So,

16 * 300 * 338 * c² + v² * 938 * 262 * c² = 0.

But 16 * 300 * 338 = 16 * 101400 = 1,622,400 MeV c².

v^2 * 938 *262 = v² * 245,756 MeV c².

So,

1,622,400 MeV c² + 245,756 MeV c² v² = 0.

But both terms are positive, which can't sum to zero. So there's a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles have the same velocity is incorrect. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: considering that in the COM frame, the four A particles are produced at rest, but that can't be because their total rest energy is 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial rest energy of 1876 MeV.

Wait, but in the COM frame, the initial system has energy E_com = sqrt( (2 m_p c^2)^2 + (m_p v c)^2 ), but for v << c, E_com ≈ 2 m_p c^2 + (m_p v^2)/(2 c^2) ) * c^2 → no, wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, in the COM frame, the initial energy is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ), which I've computed earlier as approximately 2 m_p c².

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the invariant mass. The initial system's invariant mass squared is (p_p + p_p̄ )^2 = (E_p + E_p̄ )^2 - (p_p c + p_p̄ c )^2.

Since the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, and E_p = m_p c².

The antiproton's momentum is p_p̄ = m_p v, and its energy is E_p̄ = m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v².

So the invariant mass squared is:

( m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² )^2 - (m_p v c )^2.

= (2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v² )^2 - m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

Expanding:

= 4 m_p^2 c^4 + 2 m_p c^2 * (1/2 m_p v^2 ) + (1/2 m_p v^2 )^2 - m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

Simplify:

= 4 m_p^2 c^4 + m_p^2 c^2 v² + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4) - m_p^2 v^2 c^2.

The m_p^2 c^2 v^2 terms cancel, leaving:

=4 m_p^2 c^4 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4).

So the invariant mass squared is 4 m_p^2 c^4 (1 + v^4/(16 c^4)) ).

But the invariant mass must be the same after annihilation, so it must equal the invariant mass of the four A particles.

The four A particles have total energy E_A = 4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2, and total momentum p_A =4 m_A v_A.

So the invariant mass squared is:

(E_A)^2 - (p_A c )^2 = [4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2]^2 - (4 m_A v_A c )^2.

Expanding:

= 16 m_A^2 c^4 + 16 m_A^3 c² v_A² +4 m_A^2 v_A^4 - 16 m_A^2 v_A^2 c^2.

Simplify:

=16 m_A^2 c^4 + (16 m_A^3 c² v_A² -16 m_A^2 c^2 v_A^2 ) +4 m_A^2 v_A^4.

Factor out terms:

=16 m_A^2 c^4 + 16 m_A^2 c^2 v_A^2 ( m_A -1 ) ) +4 m_A^2 v_A^4.

Wait, but m_A is 300 MeV/c², and m_p is 938 MeV/c², so m_A is less than m_p. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Setting the initial and final invariant masses equal:

4 m_p^2 c^4 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ) = 16 m_A^2 c^4 + 16 m_A^2 c^2 v_A^2 ( m_A -1 ) +4 m_A^2 v_A^4.

Wait, this looks complicated. Maybe I need to make some approximations. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so v^4 is negligible. So perhaps the initial invariant mass is approximately 4 m_p^2 c^4.

So,

4 m_p^2 c^4 ≈ [4 m_A c² + 2 m_A v_A^2]^2 - (4 m_A v_A c )^2.

Compute the right-hand side (RHS):

= (4 m_A c²)^2 + 2 * 4 m_A c² * 2 m_A v_A^2 + (2 m_A v_A^2 )^2 - (4 m_A v_A c )^2.

= 16 m_A² c^4 + 16 m_A² c² v_A^2 +4 m_A² v_A^4 - 16 m_A² v_A^2 c^2.

Simplify:

= 16 m_A² c^4 + (16 m_A² c² v_A^2 - 16 m_A² c² v_A^2 ) + 4 m_A² v_A^4.

The middle terms cancel, leaving:

RHS = 16 m_A^2 c^4 +4 m_A^2 v_A^4.

Set equal to initial invariant mass ≈4 m_p² c^4:

4 m_p² c^4 = 16 m_A^2 c^4 +4 m_A^2 v_A^4.

Divide both sides by 4:

m_p² c^4 =4 m_A^2 c^4 + m_A^2 v_A^4.

Rearranged:

m_p² c^4 -4 m_A^2 c^4 = m_A^2 v_A^4.

v_A^4 = (m_p^2 c^4 -4 m_A^2 c^4 ) / m_A^2.

= [ (m_p^2 -4 m_A^2 ) c^4 ] / m_A^2.

Taking the fourth root:

v_A = c * [ (m_p^2 -4 m_A^2 ) ]^(1/4) / m_A.

Wait, let's compute the numerator.

m_p =938 MeV/c², m_A=300 MeV/c².

m_p^2 = (938)^2 ≈ 880,  938^2 = 938 *938: 900^2=810,000, 38^2=1444, 900*38*2= 68,400 → 810,000 +68,400 +1444 = 879,844 MeV²/c^4.

4 m_A^2 =4*(300)^2=4*90,000=360,000 MeV²/c^4.

So,

m_p^2 -4 m_A^2 =879,844 -360,000=519,844 MeV²/c^4.

So,

v_A^4 = (519844 MeV²/c^4 * c^4 ) / (300 MeV/c² )^2.

Wait, let me compute the units properly. [m_p² -4 m_A^2 ] is in MeV²/c^4, and m_A^2 is also in MeV²/c^4. So the division would be:

(519844 MeV²/c^4 * c^4 ) / (300^2 MeV²/c^4 ).

= (519844 * c^4 ) / (90000 ) * (MeV²/c^4 ) ) * (1/MeV²/c^4 ) ).

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

v_A^4 = (519844 ) / (300^2 ) = 519844 / 90000 ≈ 5.776.

So,

v_A^4 ≈5.776 → v_A ≈ (5.776)^(1/4) c.

Compute the fourth root of 5.776.

Well, 1.5^4 = (2.25)^2 =5.0625.

1.6^4: 1.6^2=2.56 → 2.56^2=6.5536. So 5.776 is between 1.5^4 and 1.6^4.

Let me compute 1.57^4.

1.57^2= approx 2.4649.

2.4649^2= about 6.076. Hmm, too high.

Wait, 1.55^4.

1.55^2= 2.4025.

2.4025^2= approx 5.772.

Which is very close to 5.776. So v_A ≈1.55 c. But that's impossible because v cannot exceed c.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the approximation that v is small is invalid, and this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another way. Maybe using relativistic kinematics.

Another approach: considering that the initial system's rest frame has energy E and momentum p. Then, the four-momentum is (E, p c).

The invariant mass squared is E² - (p c )^2 = (sum of energies)^2 - (sum of momenta * c )^2.

Which is the same as before.

But perhaps the products must have the same invariant mass. So the four A particles must have an invariant mass equal to that of the initial system.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the annihilation, the four A particles are produced, and their energies and momenta must match the initial four-momentum.

Assuming that the A particles are all moving in the same direction, which is an approximation, but perhaps necessary.

So, let each A have energy E_A and momentum p_A.

Then, the total energy is 4 E_A = E_initial.

The total momentum is 4 p_A = p_initial.

So,

E_A = (E_initial) /4,

p_A = (p_initial) /4.

Now, for each A, E_A^2 = (p_A c )^2 + (m_A c^2)^2.

So,

(E_initial/4 )^2 = ( (p_initial c ) /4 )^2 + (m_A c^2 )^2.

Multiply both sides by 16:

E_initial^2 = (p_initial c )^2 + 16 (m_A c^2 )^2.

But E_initial = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v^2,

p_initial = m_p v.

Substitute into the equation:

[2 m_p c^2 + (1/2 m_p v^2 )]^2 = ( m_p v c )^2 + 16 (m_A c^2 )^2.

Expanding the left side:

=4 m_p² c^4 + 2 * 2 m_p c^2 * (1/2 m_p v^2 ) + (1/2 m_p v^2 )^2.

=4 m_p² c^4 + 2 m_p^2 c^2 v^2 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ).

So,

4 m_p^2 c^4 + 2 m_p^2 c^2 v^2 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ) = m_p^2 v^2 c^2 + 16 m_A^2 c^4.

Bring all terms to one side:

4 m_p^2 c^4 + 2 m_p^2 c^2 v^2 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ) - m_p^2 v^2 c^2 - 16 m_A^2 c^4 = 0.

Simplify:

4 m_p^2 c^4 + (2 m_p^2 c^2 v^2 - m_p^2 c^2 v^2 ) + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ) - 16 m_A^2 c^4 = 0.

Which becomes:

4 m_p^2 c^4 + m_p^2 c^2 v^2 + (1/4 m_p^2 v^4 ) - 16 m_A^2 c^4 = 0.

Hmm, this is the same equation I reached earlier, and it's leading me to a problem where v_A is more than c, which isn't possible. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the fact that in annihilation, the kinetic energy is negligible, so we can treat the process as if all the rest mass energy is converted into the rest mass of the products.

Wait, but the initial rest mass is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

The products have 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So, the initial system has more rest mass, so there must be kinetic energy in the products.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the fact that the velocity of A is such that their kinetic energy makes up the difference.

So, the initial rest energy is 1876 MeV.

The products' rest energy is 1200 MeV. So, the initial system has 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV of rest energy to spare, which must go into the kinetic energy of the products.

But how to distribute that among four particles.

So, the total kinetic energy of the four A particles is 676 MeV.

Assuming each A has the same kinetic energy, that would be 676 /4 = 169 MeV per particle.

The kinetic energy for each A is (γ - 1) m_A c² = 169 MeV.

So,

γ = 1 + 169 / 300 = 1 + 0.563333 ≈ 1.563333.

γ = 1.563333 → 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1.563333.

Solving for v:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/1.563333 ≈ 0.64.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = (0.64)^2 ≈0.4096.

v^2/c^2 =1-0.4096=0.5904.

v/c= sqrt(0.5904)= ~0.768c.

Which is approximately 0.77c. Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, does this make sense? Because this approach assumes that the kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four particles, which may not be the case. But given the options, this seems to lead to option A.

But earlier when trying to model the velocities, I got a v_A that was higher than c, which is impossible, so this suggests that this approach is more plausible.

But wait, let's re-examine the assumption: treating the kinetic energy as the difference between initial rest mass and the products' rest mass.

But the initial system's rest mass is 2 m_p c² = 1876 MeV.

The products' rest mass is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV.

So the difference is 676 MeV, which must be the total kinetic energy of the products.

Assuming each of the four A particles has KE = (676)/4 = 169 MeV.

So, KE = (γ -1) m_A c² = 169 MeV.

=> (γ -1) = 169 /300 = 0.5633.

So γ =1.5633.

γ = 1.5633 → v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2 )).

Compute 1/γ^2 = 1/( (1.5633)^2 ) ≈1/2.443 ≈0.4095.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 -0.4095=0.5905 → v/c ≈0.768.

Which rounds to approximately 0.77c. So option A is the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Given:**
- The reaction is \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \).
- The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest energy.
- The rest energy of particle \( A \) is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
- The goal is to find the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy). After annihilation, the total energy is distributed among the four \( A \)-particles (rest energy and kinetic energy).

   - Initial energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \left( m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p v^2 \right) = 2 m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p v^2
     \]
   - Final energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \left( m_A c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_A v_A^2 \right)
     \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The initial momentum is due to the antiproton, as the proton is assumed to be at rest. After annihilation, the total momentum of the four \( A \)-particles must equal the initial momentum.

   - Initial momentum:  
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = m_p v
     \]
   - Final momentum:  
     \[
     p_{\text{final}} = 4 m_A v_A
     \]

   From momentum conservation:  
   \[
   m_p v = 4 m_A v_A \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_A = \frac{m_p v}{4 m_A}
   \]

3. **Energy Distribution**:  
   The initial rest energy of the system is \( 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} \). The rest energy of the four \( A \)-particles is \( 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \). The difference, \( 1876 - 1200 = 676 \, \text{MeV} \), represents the total kinetic energy of the products.

   Assuming the kinetic energy is evenly distributed among the four \( A \)-particles, each \( A \)-particle has a kinetic energy of:  
   \[
   KE_A = \frac{676}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

4. **Relating Kinetic Energy to Velocity**:  
   The kinetic energy of each \( A \)-particle is related to its velocity by:  
   \[
   KE_A = (\gamma - 1) m_A c^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( KE_A = 169 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):  
   \[
   \gamma - 1 = \frac{169}{300} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = 1.5633
   \]

   Solving for \( v_A \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma} = \frac{1}{1.5633} \approx 0.64
   \]
   \[
   1 - v_A^2/c^2 = 0.64^2 = 0.4096 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904
   \]
   \[
   v_A/c = \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768
   \]

   Thus, \( v_A \approx 0.77c \).

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
