Okay, so I have this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, but wait—when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths. So the quasar emits light, but if there's a hydrogen cloud in front, the light we receive from the quasar will have absorption lines at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but redshifted because the cloud is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe).

Redshift, z, relates the observed wavelength (λ) to the emitted wavelength (λ0) via λ = λ0 * (1 + z). So if the quasar is at a certain redshift, the hydrogen cloud's absorption would be at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for detection by optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe in the visible spectrum, which is about 400-700 nm. Oh wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. So if the observed wavelength is in the optical range, that's longer than 1216 Angstroms.

So for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, which is longer than 400 nm, let's set λ >= 400 nm. Wait, but maybe the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is just within the optical range. So the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is ultraviolet. For ground-based telescopes to observe it, the light must be redshifted into the visible. So when does 1216 Angstroms become 400 nm?

Let me convert 400 nm to Angstroms: 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength λ must be at least 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) for ground-based telescopes to see it, right?

Wait no,
