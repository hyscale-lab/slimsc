Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. I think it infects the small intestine, so the Peyer patches must be involved since those are areas in the intestinal wall that contain immune cells, like lymphocytes. Peyer patches are part of the mucosal immune system, right?

The question says that the inner capsid proteins are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. When they do this, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid and some get entangled in the intestinal mucus. But some must make it through to the secondary lymphoid organs, which are places like the Peyer patches.

They isolate the proliferating cells from the Peyer patches and look at the variable heavy chain genes. There's high variability in the sequences. So, what process causes high variability in the variable regions of antibodies?

I remember that during the immune response, B cells undergo several processes that diversify their antibodies. One is VDJ recombination, which happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. This process creates the initial diversity in the variable regions of the B cell receptor. But once the B cells are activated, especially after they encounter an antigen, another process called somatic hypermutation occurs. Somatic hypermutation introduces more mutations in the variable region, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This helps the immune system respond more effectively to a wide range of pathogens.

So in this case, the GFP-tagged proteins are acting as antigens. The B cells in the Peyer patches are probably being activated by these antigens, leading to their proliferation. When B cells proliferate, especially in the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after sequencing. 

Wait, but what about class switching recombination? That process changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the variable regions. It's more about the type of antibody produced rather than the diversity. And complement activation is more about the classical pathway, maybe leading to opsonization or lysis, but not about the genetic variability.

VDJ recombination happens during the initial stages of B cell development, so the cells in the Peyer patches are probably mature B cells that have already gone through that. So the observed variability after they've been activated is due to somatic hypermutation.

So the process here must be somatic hypermutation. That would be option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are exposed to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but some reach the secondary lymphoid organs, including the Peyer patches. In the Peyer patches, the fluorescent cells are isolated, and their proliferating populations are sequenced for the variable heavy chain genes, showing high variability. This variability is indicative of a process that diversifies the antibody repertoire during the immune response.

Somatic hypermutation is the process by which B cells introduce mutations into the variable regions of their antibody genes after antigen recognition. This increases the diversity of antibodies and allows for a more effective immune response. In this case, the GFP-tagged proteins act as antigens, activating B cells in the Peyer patches. During their proliferation in the germinal centers, these B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, leading to the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Other processes, such as VDJ recombination, class switching recombination, and complement activation, do not explain the observed variability. VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, and the cells in the Peyer patches are mature. Class switching recombination alters the antibody isotype but does not increase variability in the variable regions. Complement activation is unrelated to genetic variability.

Thus, the process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
