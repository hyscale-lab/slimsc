Okay, I need to figure out how to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ using a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid and then find the required volume of the acid and the pH of the solution. Hmm, let me start by breaking this down.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and to dissolve it, I need an acid. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl, it should react with Fe(OH)3 in a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water.

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction should be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, no, actually, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each molecule would need three H+ ions. So the balanced equation is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) → 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Given that I have 0.1 grams, moles = mass/molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me write that as approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:3, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which means each liter has 0.1 moles. Since I'm looking for volume in cm³, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³, the concentration is 0.1 mol/L, or 0.1 mol per 1000 cm³.

The moles of H+ needed are 0.002808, so the volume of acid needed is moles / concentration. So 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters. To convert to cm³, multiply by 1000, so 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, which is close. Maybe I should check my calculations for any rounding errors.

Wait, let me recheck the molar mass. Fe is about 55.85, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85+51=106.85. Yep, that's correct.

Molar calculation: 0.1g /106.85 = approx 0.0009358 moles. Multiply by 3 for H+ gives about 0.0028075. Divided by 0.1 M, gives 0.028075 L, which is 28.075 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³. So option C is 28.05, which is very close. Hmm, maybe a more precise calculation would get 28.05.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me compute it more accurately.

Molar mass of
