Okay, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think through it.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The incident electrons have 50 MeV of energy. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula involves these phase shifts. Oh right, the general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} [e^{i l φ} - 1] [something].

Wait, more precisely, the expression for the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ)

where P_l are the Legendre polynomials, and δ_l are the phase shifts. But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, that means θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is along the initial direction, so when θ is zero, the scattering is along the same direction as the incident beam. So θ=0°, so cosθ=1.

So, along the incident direction, what's f? Let's think. The formula simplifies because P_l(1) is zero except for l=0. Because the Legendre polynomial P_0(x) = 1, since l=0 is a constant function. For l>0, P_l(1) is 1/(2l) when l=0, but wait, wait, for l>0, P_l(1) is 1. Or wait, no—actually, for l ≥ 1, P_l(1)=1. No, wait, I think that's not right. Let me recall: the Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1 are all 1 for l=0, l=1, etc. Because P₀(x)=1, P₁(x)=x, which is 1 at x=1, P₂(x)= (3x²-1)/2, which is (3*1 -1)/2 = 1, etc. So at θ=0°, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 for all l. Wait, but wait, no—wait, P₀(1)=1, P₁(1)=1, P₂(1)=1, yeah. Because Legendre polynomials are defined such that P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So that's correct.

Wait, so if P_l(1)=1 for all l, then the expression for f(θ=0) becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{iδ_l} - 1] * 1

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ (2*0 +1)(e^{iδ_0} -1) + (2*1+1)(e^{iδ_1} -1) + ... ]

But in the problem statement, it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4. So I guess we only consider l=0 to l=4.

So the sum becomes l=0 to 4. So:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ (1)(e^{iδ₀} -1) + 3(e^{iδ₁} -1) + 5(e^{iδ₂} -1) +7(e^{iδ₃} -1) +9(e^{iδ4} -1) ]

I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of this. But wait, first I think I should compute f(θ=0) and then take the imaginary part.

So let's compute each term in the sum:

Let me write each term for l=0 to 4:

Term for l=0: (1) [e^{i δ0} -1] = e^{i 90°} -1. δ0 is 90 degrees.

Wait, but 90 degrees in radians is π/2. e^{i π/2} = i. So e^{i90°} -1 = i - 1.

Similarly, l=1: 3[e^{i67°} -1]

l=2:5 [e^{i55°} -1]

l=3:7 [e^{i
