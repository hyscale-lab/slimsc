Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with the answers being 0,1,3,5.

Wait, what's the index of hydrogen deficiency again? Oh right, it's the sum of double bonds, triple bonds, and rings in the molecule. Each ring or pi bond counts as one. So, I need to find out what the product looks like after the reaction and then calculate that.

The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, right! When you have red phosphorus and HI, it's a reaction called the hydroxymercuration or maybe more accurately, it's a deoxygenation reaction. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think red phosphorus and HI are used to convert carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, into alkanes or other products. Oh wait, another thought: maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses Zn-Hg and HCl, right? So this must be the other one.

Oh wait, I remember now. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's more for ketones and aldehydes to reduce them to methylene groups. Or wait, no, wait. Another possibility is that red phosphorus with HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation or maybe it's for the hydrolysis of some groups. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of carbonyl groups using this reagent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: perhaps 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has some carbonyl groups. The 2-formyl group is an aldehyde, right? And the cyclohexene ring has a double bond. So, when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group might be getting reduced.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus with HI is often used to reduce aldehydes and ketones. The aldehyde group (formyl) would be converted into a methylene group (-CH2-). So the formyl group (RCHO) becomes RCH2OH initially, but wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the reaction is that the aldehyde or ketone reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The mechanism involves the formation of a ylide, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon. For an aldehyde, the product would be an alkane, I think. Wait, no, let me get this right. The Red Phosphorus and HI (also called the HWE reaction?), no, that's the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol, but wait, I thought that's with NaBH4 or LiAlH4, but maybe these reagents are different.

Wait, another angle: the formyl group (RCHO) when treated with red phosphorus and HI is converted into RCH2I? No, no, maybe. Or perhaps the aldehyde is converted into an alcohol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, aldehydes are reduced to alkanes. So, RCHO → RCH2I? Or RCH2OH? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Wait, but the product of the reaction is supposed to be a compound, and then we need to find its degree of unsaturation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of water. Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid. So it has a carboxylic acid group, a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a formyl group (another double bond), and a vinyl group (another double bond). Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Hmm, so let me draw it mentally. The cyclohexene ring has double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). At position 2, there is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-).

Wait, no, the structure would be: the cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2 as in CH2=CH- attached to the ring? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene (double bond), a formyl group (a carbonyl), and a vinyl group (another double bond). So the starting molecule has three double bonds (the cyclohexene, the formyl, the vinyl), but wait, the formyl is a carbonyl (C=O) which counts as a double bond. And cyclohexene has one double bond. The vinyl group has its own double bond (CH2=CH-). So that's three double bonds. Plus, the ring itself is a six-membered ring, but that's part of the double bond count.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material: each ring or double bond is +1. So the starting material has a cyclohexene (double bond: 1), the formyl (another: 2), the vinyl (another:3). So index is 3. But the question is about the product after reaction.

So the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Now, what happens to each of these groups.

First, the formyl group (CHO). When an aldehyde reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's reduced to a methylene group. So CHO → CH2I? Or perhaps CH2OH? Wait, no, I think the reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde to an alkane. Wait, an aldehyde (RCHO) reacting with red phosphorus and HI would form RCH2I. Let me think. The mechanism: the aldehyde reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus. The aldehyde gets converted into an alkyl iodide. So formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I.

Wait, but another possibility: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde could be converted into a primary alcohol. Wait, but that would be if the reagent were something else, like NaBH4. Hmm, but red phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, I think I recall that when aldehydes or ketones are treated with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl group is converted into a methylene group. So RCHO + HI → RCH2I.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction to the corresponding alkane. Wait, no, I think the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. Let me think: for example, the formyl group (CHO) would become CH2I.

Wait, if that's the case, then the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I. So that reduces the number of double bonds from 3 in the starting material to... Let's see, the product would have the cyclohexene ring (still a double bond), the vinyl group (still a double bond), and the formyl group is gone, replaced by CH2I, which has single bonds. So the product would have two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl) and the iodide is single bond. So the index would be 2? But wait, the options don't have 2. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is also reacting. Because the reagent is excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would undergo some addition. Since the vinyl group is a double bond, maybe it's added to HI. So, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which would react with HI in a typical addition reaction.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde is more reactive than the vinyl group. So the aldehyde group would react first. Once the aldehyde is converted, perhaps the other groups remain.

So, the starting material has three double bonds (cyclohexene, formyl, vinyl). After reaction, the formyl becomes CH2I, which has no double bonds. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is still present. The cyclohexene ring is still there. So the product has two double bonds: the cyclohexene and the vinyl. So the index would be 2, which isn't an option. The options are 0,1,3,5.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction. Perhaps the cyclohexene ring also undergoes some reaction. Wait, the reaction is with excess HI. Could the cyclohexene ring undergo addition? Like a dihydroxylation or something else? Or maybe the ring is hydrogenated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is not the only one reacting. Maybe the vinyl group also reacts. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the opening of the cyclohexene to form a diol or something. But I think HI is a strong acid and can cause ring-opening in some cases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The product is from the reaction. Let me think about what each group would become.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Reaction with red phosphorus and HI: So, the formyl group (CHO) is at position 2. HI is a nucleophile, and red phosphorus is a reducing agent. So perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2I group.

So, the product now has a CH2I group at position 2, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5, and the cyclohexene ring remains. So the product would have two double bonds: the cyclohexene and the vinyl. So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 2.

But the options don't have 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, what about the carboxylic acid group? The molecule is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not sure. Maybe the acid is unaffected because the reaction conditions aren't strong enough to decarboxylate or reduce the acid group.

Wait, another thought: maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is also reacting. In the presence of excess HI, could the double bond be opened? For example, in an addition reaction. Vinyl groups typically add H and I across the double bond.

So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2-CH2-I? Or perhaps CH2-I and CH2 added with H.

Wait, no, addition of HI to a vinyl group would proceed as a typical acid-catalyzed addition. So, the double bond would convert to a single bond with H and I added across it. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2-CH2-I? Or maybe CH2-CH2-I is not possible, wait. Let me think: addition of HI to CH2=CH- would give CH2-I-CH2-? No, wait, the correct addition would be CH2-I-CH3? No, wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, when HI adds to a double bond, it's a two-step process. The proton adds to one end, making a carbocation, then the iodide ion attacks the other end. So for CH2=CH-, adding HI would give CH2-CH2-I, but I think that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct product would be CH2-I-CH3. Wait, no, CH2=CH2 would add HI to become CH3-CH2-I. Wait, no, wait, for ethylene (CH2=CH2), adding HI gives CH2I-CH3. So in that case, the product is CH2I-CH3, a substituted ethane.

So, in our case, the vinyl group is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the vinyl group is CH2-CH2 as a substituent. So if the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) reacts, it would become CH2-CH2-I, but wait, that's not the right structure. Let me think again.

The vinyl group is CH2=CH-R (where R is the cyclohexene ring). When HI adds, the H adds to the less substituted carbon. So the structure would become CH2+-CH2-R, then the iodide would attack the adjacent carbon. So the product would be CH2-I-CH2-R. Wait, so the vinyl group becomes CH2-CH2-I, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group becomes CH2-CH2-I, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-CH2-I, but that would imply a single bond between the two carbons, each having an I and adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back. So in the product, the formyl group is now CH2I, the vinyl group is now CH2-CH2-I, and the cyclohexene ring is still present. So how many double bonds are left?

Wait, no, the vinyl group after addition would have no double bonds, as it's been converted to a single bond. So the product would have only the cyclohexene ring as a double bond.

Wait, but what about the cyclohexene ring? Does it react with HI? In the presence of HI and red phosphorus, would the cyclohexene ring undergo addition? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring remains, as the reaction is more focused on the aldehyde and the vinyl groups.

So, let's recount the double bonds in the product. The starting material has three double bonds: formyl (C=O), cyclohexene (C=C), and vinyl (C=C). After reaction, the formyl becomes CH2I (no double bond), the vinyl becomes CH2-CH2-I (no double bond), and the cyclohexene remains as a double bond. So the product has one double bond. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but why did the cyclohexene remain? Because the reaction conditions may not be strong enough to open the ring. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene isn't reactive under these conditions. Or perhaps the reagent is more selective for the aldehyde and the vinyl group, leaving the cyclohexene untouched.

So the product has the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), and that's it. So index is 1.


The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. The starting compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the formyl group (C=O), and one in the vinyl group (CH=CH). Therefore, the starting material has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 3.

When the compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the aldehyde group (formyl group) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH2I), eliminating one double bond. The vinyl group (CH=CH) also reacts with HI, undergoing addition across the double bond to form a single bond, eliminating another double bond. The cyclohexene ring remains unaffected under these reaction conditions, retaining its double bond.

In the product, only the cyclohexene ring contributes to the index of hydrogen deficiency, as the formyl and vinyl groups no longer contain double bonds. Thus, the product has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 1.

The correct answer is **A) 1**.

Answer: A
