Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup: There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. They're using the radial velocity (RV) method to detect these exoplanets.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift to a shorter wavelength (blue shift), and when it moves away, they shift to a longer wavelength (red shift). The periodic shifts indicate the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

The problem states that for planet #1, the periodic shift in the spectral line is up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula that comes to mind is something like the star's velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the orbital characteristics.

Wait, the equation I think is K = (v) where v is the velocity of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) / ( (P) * (1 day) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) / ( (M_p)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (P * G ) / (2π c³) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But in this problem, the stars have masses similar to the Sun (M_star ≈ M_sun) and the planets have masses similar to Neptune (M_p << M_sun). So M_star + M_p ≈ M_sun. So M_p sin i is approximately the planet's mass.

So K ≈ ( (P G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) ) / ( (2 π c³ M_sun^(2/3) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the simplified formula when M_p is much smaller than M_star. Let me see.

Another approach: the RV method depends on the star's velocity semi-amplitude K, which is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (1 / ( (P)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I should get the correct formula. I think the correct formula for K is:

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p * sin i ) / ( (2 π c^3 )^(1/3) * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period P, given that M_p is much smaller than M_star.

Wait, another way. The RV method's velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period. Wait, no, I'm probably getting confused. Let me think again.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1
