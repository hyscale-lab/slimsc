Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

First, I'll look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data might help me figure out what the compound is, and then I can predict the reaction product.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are in the ranges 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or acid. The 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, which is likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, wait. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But if it's an acidic proton, maybe a carboxylic acid, but those are usually around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be a carboxylic acid (but those usually have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 as well, which is present here). Hmm. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5, which is a bit high for an aldehyde. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, another thought: if it's a benzylic position or something else.

Let's break down the NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe an aldehyde proton. But that's quite upfield for an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps an acidic proton like an α,β-unsaturated ketone or something else. Or maybe an aromatic proton coupled with something else? Wait, no, aromatic protons are usually lower. So maybe this is an aldehyde. But wait again. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be broad around 10-12, but the 1720 in IR could correspond to a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid (which usually has a carbonyl around 1700-1725). So maybe this is a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring.

But looking at the NMR peaks: Let's see the other signals. There's a doublet at 8.0 ppm (2H), another doublet at 7.2 ppm (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two protons on each side are each a doublet, which would be the case if it's a para substitution on a benzene ring. So maybe it's para-substit
