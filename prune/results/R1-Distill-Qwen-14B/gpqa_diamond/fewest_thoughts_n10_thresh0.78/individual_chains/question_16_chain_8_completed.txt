Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many of these compounds are optically active. I remember that optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? But wait, there's more to it. Some structures might seem chiral but aren't because of symmetry or other factors. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, so that's a butene with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. The substituents on each carbon of the double bond are Cl on C1 and a methyl and two CH2 groups on C2. Wait, but the configuration is Z, which is about the arrangement around the double bond. But does that make it chiral? No, because a double bond itself isn't a chiral center. The molecule would need a stereogenic center. So, looking at the structure, the molecule is probably planar around the double bond. Does the structure have any other chiral centers? Like, maybe the substituents. Let me see: C1 has Cl, CH2CH2CH3? Or wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but with a double bond. So, it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond from C1 to C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and another group. So the substituents on C1 and C2. For a double bond to cause E/Z isomerism, the substituents on each end must be different.

But in terms of chirality, the molecule needs a tetrahedral center. So, does any carbon here have four different substituents? Let's see. C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, wait. The structure of 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3)? No, I'm getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 2-methyl-1-chloro-1-butene. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But in any case, the C1 has Cl, a double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps, more accurately, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So C1 has Cl and CH2CH2CH3. No, wait, perhaps a better approach: each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2) has two substituents each. C1: Cl and CH2CH2CH3 (but that can't be right, because but-1-ene is four carbons with double bond at 1-2). Wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene has four carbons. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is C(CH3), double bond between C1 and C2, and then C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH-CH3? Wait, that would be 1-chloro-2-methyl-1-pentene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be 3 carbons, not four. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether any carbon is a chiral center. For a double bond, you can't have a chiral center there. So the question is, does any of the carbons in this molecule have four different groups?

Looking again, perhaps C1 has Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups. So the substituents would be Cl, C2 (double bond), and two CH2 groups. But CH2 groups are same, so that's two same groups. So C1 would have Cl, double bond (which is a substituent?), and two CH2 groups. No, wait, the substituents on a carbon are the groups attached. So for C1, substituents are Cl, a double bond (so the adjacent carbon is part of the double bond), and the other two would be single bonds. Wait, perhaps C1 is CH2Cl, connected via double bond to C2, which is CH(CH3), and then connected to CH2CH3? No, maybe not.

I think maybe in this structure, none of the carbons have four different substituents. Because, for example, C1 is attached to Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond. But wait, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to three groups: two single bonds and one double bond. Wait, no, the double bond involves two substituents. So each carbon in a double bond is connected to two other carbons (in the case of butene) and the substituents. So, for butene, each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. So for but-1-ene, C1 has two CH2 groups and a double bond to C2. So no, C1 would have CH2Cl, and the double bond to C2. Then on C2, it's connected to CH(CH3) and a double bond to C1. So in this case, the substituents on C1 are Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (the rest of the chain), and the double bond. Wait, maybe not. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should move on and come back.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. That's a mouthful. Let's parse it. Hexahydro means six-membered ring. Methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione suggests a bicyclic structure with a ketone groups. But the key here is the substituents and the configuration. The compound has a chloromethylene group, which is CH2Cl. The E configuration indicates that the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. But does that make the molecule chiral? Wait, the molecule could have a double bond with substituents on either end, but for chirality, you need a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a ring that's not symmetric, leading to chirality. Or perhaps the chloromethylene is attached in such a way that the molecule has a stereogenic center. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the ring create a chiral center. But I'm not sure. Let's think: chloromethylene is CH2Cl connected via a double bond. So perhaps the structure is such that the CH2Cl is part of a substituent on the ring, and the double bond is part of the ring. Wait, but I'm not a hundred percent sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a bridge which creates a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents around the rings lead to a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so no. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe I'll need to think about this later.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If both the middle CH2 groups are substituted with methyl groups, then the structure becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH. Wait, but wait: 2 and 3 positions are substituted. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of those CH(CH3) groups is a carbon connected to two CH2 groups (from the succinic acid), a methyl, and the adjacent carbon. So, each of those carbons is attached to a methyl, two CH2 groups (but wait, each CH in the middle would have two CH2 groups? No, wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents? Let's see. C2: -CH(CH3) is connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (another CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? No, wait, wait. No, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two H's? Or wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has: for C2: two CH3 groups, a COOH group, and the C3. Wait, no. Let me draw it. C1 is COOH, C2 is CH(CH3), which is connected to C1, C3, and two methyl groups? No, wait, no. The groups on C2 would be: two CH2 groups? Or wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups to C2 and C3: so each middle CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the two middle carbons is CH(CH3), which is connected to the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3). So the substituents for C2 are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3 groups? No, wait. Each CH(CH3) is a carbon with one CH3, and two CH2 groups? No, maybe not. Alternatively, each middle carbon is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, wait, no. If it's 2,3-dimethyl succinic acid, each of the middle carbons has a methyl group. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of those CH(CH3) carbons has four substituents: each has a methyl, a COOH group (on C2 from C1), another CH(CH3) (on C3), and two H's? No, wait, that can't be. Each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- C1: for C2, connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and a CH3. So the substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another... Wait, no. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So for C2: it's connected to C1 (as -CH2- in succinic acid becomes -CH(CH3)-). So C2: two single bonds to adjacent carbons (C1 and C3), one double bond? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps each middle carbon is CH(CH3), with substituents: one CH3, two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and another CH(CH3) from C3. No, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it differently. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. So, for C2 in this compound: what are its substituents? The groups attached are:

1. The COOH group from C1 (so the left side is a carbonyl).
Wait, no. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we add methyl groups at C2 and C3, we have HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for the C2 carbon: it's connected to:

- The COOH group (C1).
- The C3 carbon (CH(CH3)).
- A methyl group (CH3).
- And another substituent, which would be a hydrogen? Because CH(CH3) has three substituents: two from the chain and one methyl. Wait, no, the structure is -CH(CH3)-, so each of these has two CH2 groups? I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps each of these middle carbons is CH2 substituted with a methyl. Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

- One COOH group (C1 for C2; C4 for C3).
- One CH(CH3) group (C3 for C2; C2 for C3).
- One methyl group (CH3).
- And another group, which is a hydrogen.

So, for C2: substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. Wait, no, because the adjacent carbons are CH(CH3), which are connected via single bonds. So each of these substituents is:

- For C2: 

1. The COOH group (from C1)
2. The adjacent C3 (which is CH(CH3))
3. A methyl group (CH3)
4. A hydrogen (since it's CH(CH3), it's CH2 if not substituted, but wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

Each CH(CH3) is connected to:

- The COOH group (on one side)
- Another CH(CH3) on the other side
- A methyl group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, if that's the case, then for each of these carbons (C2 and C3), the substituents are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and H. But wait, if that's the case, then each of these carbons would have four different substituents. Because COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H are all different. So that would make them chiral centers. But wait, C2 and C3 are adjacent. If each has four different groups, then each would be a chiral center. But in this compound, the configuration is (2R,3S). So both are chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule has two chiral centers and is therefore chiral. So this compound will exhibit optical activity. So that's one.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Structure is similar to the third compound but with both configurations R. So same structure, but (2R,3R). Whether this is a meso compound or not. Because if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it could be achiral despite having chiral centers. So in the third compound, the configurations are R and S, which might lead to a meso form. But in this fourth compound, both are R. Let me think about the structure. If C2 and C3 are both R, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry. Because if the substituents on both are same configurations, then the mirror image would not be the same. Wait, no. Let me think: if the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH with both chiral centers R, would it be a meso compound? Because if the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, then the whole molecule would be achiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a diastereomer of the third compound. Wait, but in the third compound, the configurations are R and S. So the third compound may be a meso compound if the configurations are opposite. Let me think: if the two chiral centers are mirror images, then the molecule is meso. So for the third compound, (2R,3S), if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and not chiral. But if it doesn't, then it's chiral.

So for the first case, (2R,3S): if the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound. But if it's not symmetric, then it's chiral. So, let's imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If you look at the two middle carbons, each has a methyl and a hydrogen. So, if the configurations are R and S, then could the molecule be symmetric? Because the two chiral centers are adjacent and have the same substituents. So, imagine flipping the molecule over a plane that goes through the middle; would the configurations remain the same? If the mirror image results in the same molecule, then it's a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If the two methyl groups are on the same side, then maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Wait, no. Let's think of the substituents. If C2 has R configuration and C3 has S, then the arrangement of substituents would make the molecule either chiral or meso. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if the two chiral centers are mirror images, then the molecule is meso and thus not chiral. So, in the third compound, (2R,3S), if it's a meso compound, then it's not chiral. But if it's not meso, then it is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps these two chiral centers are identical. Wait, in the third compound, (2R,3S), considering the arrangement, the two chiral centers are adjacent and have the same groups. So if you mirror the molecule, the configurations would swap. If the two configurations are R and S, then the molecule could be a meso compound. So for instance, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it has (R,S) configuration because of the internal plane of symmetry. So in that case, the molecule would be achiral.

So for the third compound, (2R,3S), it's a meso compound and thus not chiral. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity. But wait, the fourth compound is (2R,3R). In that case, the two chiral centers have the same configuration. Then, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral. So the fourth compound is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Okay, so cyclohexene with an -OH group on carbon 1. The configuration is R. So, is the carbon with the OH group a chiral center? Let's see: the groups attached would be OH, the two adjacent carbons (from the cyclohexene ring), and the substituent from the double bond.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, perhaps? So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1. So C1 is connected to C2, C6, and the OH. What about the fourth substituent? Well, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents. So C1 has OH, and three other groups: C2, C6, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and has two substituents (like H). So if the ring has a double bond, perhaps C1 is connected to C2, C6, and two Hs. But if the ring is not chair-like but perhaps boat-like, that might complicate things, but for the sake of determining chirality, I can think in terms of substituents.

Wait, the molecule is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 has the OH group, and is connected to C2 and C6. But each carbon in the ring has two substituents. So, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, C2 (which is CH2), C6 (which is CH2), and a hydrogen. No, wait, because in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons and has two substituents. So, for C1, substituents are OH, C2 (a CH2 group), C6 (a CH2 group), and a hydrogen? Is that correct? No, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think: the structure is a cyclohexene ring, so a six-membered ring with a double bond. The OH is on C1. So the substituents on C1 are:

1. OH group.

2. Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6).

3. A hydrogen.

So, substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and H. Wait, but that would mean three substituents: C2, C6, OH, and the fourth substituent is H. So C1 has four substituents: two CH2 (from ring), OH, and H. Are any of these the same? If the two CH2 groups are the same (i.e., the ring is symmetric around C1), then C1 would have two identical substituents (the CH2 groups). So if substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C6), OH, and H, then the substituents are all different. Because CH2 from C2 and CH2 from C6 could be different due to the ring structure. Wait, if the ring is unsymmetric around C1, then C2 and C6 substituents might be different. For example, if C2 is next to the double bond and C6 is not, then their substituents could be different.

Wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C2 is adjacent to C3, which is part of the double bond. C6 is adjacent to C5, which is not part of the double bond. So, the substituents on C2 and C6 from the ring would be different because C2 is attached to a double-bonded C3, and C6 is attached to a single-bonded C5.

Therefore, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH

- C2 (which is connected to a double bond)

- C6 (which is connected to a single bond)

- H

So, all four substituents are different. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a chiral center and will exhibit optical activity. So that's another one.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So, three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. All in the s configuration. Now, whether this molecule is chiral depends on whether it has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. If all are S configuration, what does the structure look like?

If the three OH groups are at 1,3,5, and all are S, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the ring is symmetric. Let me visualize: positions 1,3,5 on a six-membered ring. That would be every other carbon, forming an equilateral triangle around the ring. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration (S), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because upon flipping, the configurations would mirror each other. Alternatively, maybe not, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if you have three substituents placed symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, the substituents are at 1,3,5. So, each is 120 degrees apart. If each OH is pointing in the same direction, the molecule might be symmetric. For example, if all OHs are axial or all equatorial, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetrical, then it would be achiral. But wait, in this case, all three OHs are in the s configuration. Let's think about the configurations. Each OH is in the same configuration (s), but their positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetrically placed. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, maybe it's chiral because the arrangement of substituents leads to no symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because each substituent is in a different position and their configurations don't allow for a plane of symmetry. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso. For example, if the configurations of the substituents are such that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it would be achiral. Let me think: in the case of 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane with all s configurations, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the chair conformation. If all OHs are axial and on the same face, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, if they are on alternating faces, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: how many chiral centers are present? Each OH is on a carbon that's connected to four different groups. Let's see: each carbon (1,3,5) has an OH, and the other substituents are two CH2 groups (from the ring) and a hydrogen. So, each of these carbons would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So, three chiral centers in total. Now, whether the molecule as a whole is chiral depends on whether the configurations lead to a meso compound or not. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not chiral. But with three chiral centers, it's more complicated.

Wait, but for a molecule to be meso, it must have an even number of chiral centers, right? Because you need a plane of symmetry. So with three, it's unlikely. Therefore, the molecule would be chiral. So, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol has three chiral centers and is chiral, so it exhibits optical activity. That's another one.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure: a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. Structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Or wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2C(O)CH3. Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3COCH3? Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)-CH3. No, wait, butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2-C-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no. Let me think. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3COCH3? No, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3-C(O)-CH3? Or wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is butan-2-one. Oh, right, butan-1-one would have the ketone at the end. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Or wait, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2=C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-H? No, wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone at the first carbon. So structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), a methyl group on C3, and the rest CH2 groups.

So, structure is:

cyclopentyl
|
O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Butan-1-one is four carbons, with the ketone at the first position. So, the structure is:

O
||
C1 - C2 - C3 - C4

So, substituents on C1 are O (as part of ketone), cyclopentyl, and two other groups. Wait, no, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to two other carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the structure: 

The carbonyl is at C1. Then C2 is connected to C1, and C3.

So the substituents on C2: C1 (carbonyl), C3, and two CH2 groups. Or perhaps, C2 is connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3, and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), then C2 is connected to C1, C3, and two CH2 groups. Or maybe C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each carbon's substituents.

C1: connected to O (double bond), cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups. So substituents: O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2, and CH2CH2CH3? Probably not. Alternatively, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, so substituents are: O (double bond), cyclopentyl, and two CH2 groups (one leading to C2 and another to C4? No, butan-1-one is four carbons, so C1 is carbonyl, C2, C3, C4. So the substituents on C1 are O (double bond), cyclopentyl, C2, and C4? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the carbonyl carbon is only connected to two other carbons (C2 and C4), and the cyclopentyl group. Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3COCH3? No, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe the key is that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers.

Looking for chiral centers, check each carbon:

- C1: carbonyl, so no chiral center.

- C2: connected to C1 (carbonyl), C3, and two CH2 groups. If substituents are same, not a chiral center.

- C3: connected to C2, C4, and a methyl group. Also, perhaps a CH2 group. If the substituents are same, not a chiral center.

Wait, but if C3 has a methyl group and other groups, maybe it's a chiral center. Let's see: substituents on C3 are:

- C2 (which is connected to C1 and C3)

- C4 (which is CH2CH3)

- CH(CH3) ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O=C(Cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So C3 is CH(CH3). So substituents on C3 are:

1. C2 (CH2 group from O=C-CH2-)

2. C4 (CH2CH3)

3. CH(CH3) ?

Wait, no, C3 is CH(CH3), so substituents are:

- CH2- group (from C2)

- CH2CH3 (from C4)

- CH3 (methyl)

- And the fourth substituent is another CH2 group? No, because in a butan-1-one, C3 is connected to C2 and C4.

So substituents on C3 are:

- CH2- (from C2)

- CH2CH3 (from C4)

- CH3 (methyl)

- And perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, if C3 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to C2 (CH2-), C4 (CH2CH3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So, substituents are CH2, CH2CH3, CH3, and H. All four are different. So C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and is optically active. So that's another one.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl on C3.

So the structure would be O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Thus, the carbons are:

C1: O=C, cyclopentyl, CH2 (to C2), and another CH2? No, C1 is connected to C2 (CH2) and has a cyclopentyl and the carbonyl group. So, C1 has substituents O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2 (C2), and another CH2 from where? Hmm, but maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2-Cyclopentyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-Cyclopentyl? No, but that would be longer than butan-1-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, C1 is the carbonyl, connected to cyclopentyl, C2 (CH2), and another substituent. Wait, but butan-1-one only has four carbons. So, O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a cyclopentyl on C1 and a methyl on C3.

So, the structure is O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons, but butan-1-one has four. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on.

So, the seventh compound has a chiral center at C3, so it's optically active.

Wait, earlier I thought C3 is a chiral center. Let me recheck. C3 has substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and a hydrogen. So four different groups: yes. Thus, C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, the compound is chiral and optically active.

Now, summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: I'm not sure. Let's think again. The compound has a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) attached to a ring. The molecule has an E configuration. Perhaps the ring is such that the substituents around the ring create a chiral center. Alternatively, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents arrangement leads to a chiral center. Since the configuration is given (3aR,7aS,E), the molecule has specific stereocenters. So, perhaps it's chiral. So yes, it's optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: If it's a meso compound, then no. If not, yes. Earlier thought is that it's a meso compound, so no optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Not meso, so yes. Optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral. Optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Three chiral centers, no plane of symmetry, so yes.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes, C3 is chiral.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first compound might not be chiral. Let me recheck.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2. No, but with a double bond. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, which is three carbons, but but-1-ene is four. Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the substituents on the double bond are Cl-CH2 and CH2-CH3. So, on C1, substituents are Cl, CH2 (from C2), and two H's (since it's CH2Cl). Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two substituents. So for C1 in this case, substituents are Cl, CH2 (to C2), and two H's. So, substituents on C1: Cl, CH2 (which is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2), and two H's. So, substituents are Cl, CH2 group, H, H. So two H's, which are same. Therefore, C1 isn't a chiral center. C2 has substituents: CHCl (from C1), C(CH3), and two H's. Wait, no. C2 in this structure is CH(CH3), connected via double bond to C1. So substituents on C2 would be CHCl (but wait, C1 is Cl-CH2), so substituents on C2 are CH2Cl, CH(CH3), and two H's. So substituents are CH2Cl, CH(CH3), H, H. Again, two H's, so same. So C2 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers and is not optically active.

So, to recap:

1: No

2: Yes

3: No (meso)

4: Yes

5: Yes

6: Yes

7: Yes

Wait, that would be 5 yes's. But let's recount.

Number of optically active:

2: yes (assuming it's chiral because of stereocenters)

4: yes

5: yes

6: yes

7: yes

So that's five. Wait, but the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the third compound is meso, so no. So the counting is:

2: yes

4: yes

5: yes

6: yes

7: yes

But the first and third are no. So 5 in total?

Wait, no, the count would be:

Compound 2: yes

4: yes

5: yes

6: yes

7: yes

So 5, but the options have A as 5. Wait, but I thought compound 2 is yes.

Wait, what about compound 2: (3aR,7aS,E)-... It has a specific configuration, so perhaps it has a chiral center or centers. So it's optically active.

So, the count is 5. So the answer is A)5.

Wait, but looking back, the seventh compound has a chiral center at C3, so yes.

Wait, but for the seventh compound, the structure is O=C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2-)

- C4 (CH2CH3)

- CH3 (methyl)

- H.

So, four different substituents. Thus, chiral, yes.

So, the total number of optically active compounds is 5.

Wait, but let me recount all seven:

1: No

2: Yes

3: No (meso)

4: Yes

5: Yes

6: Yes

7: Yes

So that's five (2,4,5,6,7), so 5 compounds. Therefore, the answer is A)5.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond but no chiral centers. The substituents on the carbons of the double bond are either identical or do not create four distinct groups at any carbon. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has a complex bicyclic structure with specific stereochemistry. The given configurations (3aR, 7aS, E) indicate the presence of stereogenic centers. The molecule lacks symmetry, making it **optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, it is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3. Unlike the previous compound, it is not a meso compound because the configurations of the chiral centers do not create an internal plane of symmetry. Thus, it is **optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound has a hydroxyl group on C1 of a cyclohexene ring. The substituents on C1 are distinct: OH, two different carbons from the ring, and a hydrogen. This creates a chiral center, making the compound **optically active**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each of these carbons is a chiral center due to four distinct substituents. The molecule lacks symmetry, making it **optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has a ketone group at C1, a cyclopentyl group, and a methyl group at C3. The carbon at C3 has four distinct substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2CH3 (from C4), CH3 (methyl), and a hydrogen. This creates a chiral center, making the compound **optically active**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers **2, 4, 5, 6, and 7**, resulting in a total of **5 optically active compounds**.
