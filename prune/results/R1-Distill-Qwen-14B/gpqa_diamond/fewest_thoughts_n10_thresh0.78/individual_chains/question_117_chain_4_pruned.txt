Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, as I remember, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, making it able to rotate plane-polarized light. So, the key here is to find out if each compound has any chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism, but wait, optical isomerism specifically relates to the presence of chiral centers, right?

Let's go through each option one by one.

The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings. So, it's two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, so the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. I'm trying to imagine the structure. The central bond is a single bond between the two benzene rings. Now, for biphenyl compounds, can they have stereoisomerism? I think that if the two rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate, but if the substituents are in such a way that they can't rotate into a plane of symmetry, then maybe cis and trans forms are possible. Oh wait, but optical isomerism is about being chiral, meaning the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. So, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Looking at the substituents: the dimethyl ester groups are on the 2 and 2' positions. The 6,6' positions have nitro groups. Wait, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the two substituents (ester and nitro) are on each ring. But if the substituents are all in positions that are mirror images, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, biphenyl compounds can exhibit geometric isomerism if they have substituents on each ring that are in positions that don't allow free rotation. But wait, that's more about whether they are cis or trans with respect to the central bond. But optical isomerism is about chirality, not
