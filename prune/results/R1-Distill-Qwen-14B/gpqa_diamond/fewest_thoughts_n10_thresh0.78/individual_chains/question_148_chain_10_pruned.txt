Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Let's parse the information given.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition gives A2 with an oF (probably oxidation state of F? Or maybe oxygen content? Wait, maybe ɷF is the formula or something else. Oh, maybe ɷ is the symbol for the oxygen atom? No, wait, the context is fluorine, so maybe ɷF stands for the oxidation state of F in A2. So, 31.96% is the percentage. Wait, 31.96% by mass? Or molar? Hmm, not sure yet.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 suggests A1 is an oxidizing agent. So, A1 is probably a strong oxidizing agent.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So Y plus F makes A3. So Y is being oxidized, perhaps. Wait, since it's a binary compound, Y and F.

By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, we get A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So A5 is maybe a salt that releases something when it dissolves, like maybe a fluoride and something else.

I think I need to figure out what Y is. Let me think about elements that form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. Common ones are maybe something like chlorine, but wait, Y's compounds are with F. Oh wait, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because then the compounds would be ClF, ClF2, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what about Y being oxygen? No, because oxygen forms many fluorides, but let's think about how many. Alternatively, Y could be another halogen or maybe a metal.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So, A1 → A2 + F2. So A1 is more reactive than A2. Since F2 is a product, A
