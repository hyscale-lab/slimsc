Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about calculating the amount of non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). The relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state. I need to calculate the nG (non-Gaussianity) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Hmm, okay. I remember that Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state. Non-Gaussian states are important in quantum computing because they can be useful for certain tasks that Gaussian states can't handle efficiently.

The problem is asking for the non-Gaussianity measure using relative entropy. From what I recall, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum versus classical) is a measure that compares the given state's entropy to that of the most similar Gaussian state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the formula involves calculating the density matrix of the given state and the reference Gaussian state, then computing their entropies. The non-Gaussianity is the difference between these two entropies.

Let me think about the steps involved.

1. **Compute the density matrix rho of the state |psi>.**
   The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>. The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

2. **Find the reference Gaussian state tau.**
   The reference Gaussian state is the one that is closest to rho in terms of quantum relative entropy. For a state like a superposition of coherent states, the optimal Gaussian state tau is the thermal state with certain parameters. Alternatively, I recall that for such a state, the reference Gaussian state is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho. Hmm, but I'm not too sure about that. Maybe it's the nearest Gaussian state in terms of the same first moments and same photon number variance.

Wait, another approach: For a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state that has the same first moments and the same photon number variance. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the thermal state that matches the expectation values of position and momentum (if considering coherent states in phase space) and the same photon number variance.

Alternatively, I think for a superposition state, the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first moments (same expectation values of position and momentum) and the same photon number variance as the given state. But coherent states have well-defined expectation values, so when you take a superposition, the expectation values might change. Let me compute that.

Wait, for a coherent state |alpha>, the expectation value of the annihilation operator a is alpha. So for the state |psi>, the expectation value <a> would be:

<psi| a |psi> = [cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ] a [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)| -alpha> ] / N^2

Wait, since a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a | -alpha> = (-alpha) | -alpha>, let's compute this.

So,

= [cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ] a [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)| -alpha> ] / N²

= [ cos^2(phi) <alpha|a|alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a| - alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha |a | alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a | -alpha> ] / N²

We know that <alpha|a|alpha> = alpha, and similarly < -alpha | a | -alpha> = -alpha.

The cross terms are <alpha | a | -alpha> and < -alpha | a | alpha>.

I think that for coherent states, a|beta> = beta |beta>, but what about when you have <gamma | a |beta>? Let me recall that <gamma | a | beta> = beta delta_{gamma, beta} }, because the coherent states are eigenstates of a, and they form an overcomplete basis.

Wait, no. Actually, the inner product <gamma | a | beta> is equal to a beta delta_{gamma, beta}? Or is it something else? Wait,
