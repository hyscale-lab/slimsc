Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So the starting material is cyclohexanone. I'm pretty sure cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? It has a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a carbonyl group (C=O).

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, bromine... So what reactions does cyclohexanone undergo with bromine? I remember that ketones can undergo addition reactions. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh wait, bromine might add to the carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a dienophile in some Diels-Alder reaction, but I don't think that's the case here. Or wait, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation. Because cyclohexanone can enolize, and the enol could react with bromine. Oh, right! The enol form of ketones can react with bromine to form a dibromide. So in the case of cyclohexanone, adding bromine would lead to 1,2-dibromocyclohexanone. Wait, is that correct? So the bromine would add across the carbonyl, but wait, no, the enol would have a double bond. So when the enol attacks, Br
