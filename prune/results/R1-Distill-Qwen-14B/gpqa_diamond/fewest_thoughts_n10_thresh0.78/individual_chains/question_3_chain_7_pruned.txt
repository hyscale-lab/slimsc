Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state, and we're supposed to find the expectation value of an operator.

Alright, let me start by reading the problem again. The particle is in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, expectation value. Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. Since the operator here is a combination of σz and σx, I think I can handle each term separately.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

Wait, first, I should check if the state is normalized. Because the sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let's calculate: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1. So yes, the state is normalized. Good, no worries there.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is straightforward. The matrix representation for σz in this basis is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you have a state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1).

So plugging in the values: a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's the expectation value for σz.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Oh, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as σz's. The matrix for σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the computational basis (|↑⟩, |↓⟩), σx swaps the states.

Wait, but when calculating the expectation value of σx, I can't directly use the same approach as σz because the state is in the σz basis. I need to compute it using the state.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩. Let's write out the state |ψ⟩ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So σx acting on |ψ⟩ is σx multiplied by the vector. So σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the product is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Let's compute that.

So it's (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Both terms are the same: each is (sqrt(3)/4). So adding them gives 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, actually, ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So the inner product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5). So each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/4. So two times that is sqrt(3)/2. So yes, approximately 0.8660.

So
