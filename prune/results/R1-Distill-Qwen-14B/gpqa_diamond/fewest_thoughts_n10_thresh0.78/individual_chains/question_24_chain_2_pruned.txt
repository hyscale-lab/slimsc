Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem involves mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. The question is about the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of alkenes or something that can reduce bromine, like unsaturated bonds. So X has two liquids with double bonds, maybe.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, and importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the double bonds in X have been altered in a way that they're no longer reactive towards bromine. Hmm, what reactions could do that?

The next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So, mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7 because 14.28 is about 100/7. So, the formula for Z would be C_nH_m, with H being m/(12n + m) = 1/7. 

Wait, let's think: H% is 14.28% which is 1/7. So 14.28 = (m*1)/(12n + m) * 100. Let me rearrange that equation.

(m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m

m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n

0.8572m = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n ≈ 2n

So m ≈ 2n.

Wait, but for a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnHm. So if m is approximately 2n, that's like an alkane, which is saturated. Because alkanes have 2n+2 hydrogens. Wait, wait, unless it's a different structure.

Wait, wait, let's do the math again. 14.28% is 1/7, so let's write it as:

H% = (m/(12n + m)) *100 = 1/7 *100.

So,

m = (12n + m) * (1/7)

Multiply both sides by 7:

7m = 12n + m

7m - m = 12n → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So in Z, m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n. Wait, but that's the formula for an alkene (each double bond reduces two hydrogens). But if Z is the result of hydrogenation, then Z is fully saturated. Wait, but wait. No, hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2 and saturate them. So, the product Z must be an alkane.

Wait, but the formula for an alkane is CnH2n+2. So if Z is an alkane, then m=2n+2. But according to our calculation, m=2n. That can't be. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me double-check:

H% is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

So (H mass)/(Total mass) = 1/7.

H is m grams, total is (12n + m) grams.

So,

m / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

7m = 12n + m → 6m=12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n. That's not an alkane, because alkane is H2n+2.

Wait, so that would be an alkene. But Z is formed by hydrogenation of X and Y, which suggests that X and Y have double bonds. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds.

Wait, but the problem says that after hydrogenation, only Z is formed, which is a hydrocarbon. So X and Y are each mixtures of two compounds, but when hydrogenated, they all convert to a single compound.

Wait, so perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and when hydrogenated, they both become the same alkane Z? That can't be unless the alkenes are isomers that upon hydrogenation give the same alkane.

Wait, but wait, if X is two dienes, that upon hydrogenation give the same product? Or perhaps X is two different alkenes with the same number of carbons but different structures, which hydrogenate to the same alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of an alkene and another compound. Wait, but the problem says
