Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: The particle has a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So, mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, it's suddenly turned off, and another field is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. I need to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, okay. Spin-1/2 particles—so we're dealing with quantum mechanics here. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, right? When the field is along Z, the particle's spin will align with it, giving a certain energy. 

But when the field switches to Y, that's a different direction. So the Hamiltonian must change. I remember that in such cases, the time evolution of the system can cause oscillations in expectation values.

Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z. When the magnetic field switches from Z to Y, the new Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is -μ·B. So if B is along Y, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y.

So H = -γ B S_y. Wait, actually, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, so the energy is U = -μ·B. So H = -γ B S_z when B is along Z, but when B is along Y, it's H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off and then on along Y, we have a sudden change in the Hamiltonian. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, but after the change, the Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

The time evolution of the state will follow the new Hamiltonian. Since the system is in a state that's no longer an eigenstate of H, it will evolve, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>, which is γ times <S_z>, so we can model the oscillation in <S_z>.

To find the oscillation frequency, I think we can model the system using time-dependent perturbation theory or perhaps look for the energy splitting. Alternatively, maybe we can find the energy levels and the transition frequency.

Wait, another approach: The Hamiltonian is H = (γ B) S_y. Because S_y is proportional to the ladder operators. Since the particle is spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, actually, for spin-1/2, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, but the matrix representation is something like [[0, iħ/2], [-iħ/2, 0]] divided by 2? Or perhaps I need to get the exact form right.

Wait, the Pauli matrices. The spin matrices for spin-1/2 are proportional to the Pauli matrices. So S_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the Hamilton
