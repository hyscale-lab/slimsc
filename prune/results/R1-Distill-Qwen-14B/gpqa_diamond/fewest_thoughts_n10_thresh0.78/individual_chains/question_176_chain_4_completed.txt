Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's normalized? Let me check the length. So the components are -1, 2, and 1. The sum of squares is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so I think the state vector is actually (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T. Right, because states are usually normalized.

The question is about measuring observables P and then Q. They want the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Oh wait, so the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q.

First, I need to understand the operators P and Q. Let me write down their matrices.

Operator P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row:1/sqrt(2),0,1/sqrt(2)
Third row:0,1/sqrt(2),0.

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me see if it's Hermitian, which it should be because it's an observable. The elements are real, so it's symmetric. So yes, it's Hermitian.

Operator Q:
First row:1,0,0.
Second row:0,0,0.
Third row:0,0,-1.
So this is diagonal. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible results are 1, 0, -1.

Now, when measuring P first. Let's find the possible eigenvalues of P. Hmm, but maybe I should find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P because the measurement of P will collapse the state into one of its eigenvectors.

Wait, but maybe first I can compute the expectation values? No, no, I'm looking for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, maybe the approach is to first measure P, get 0, then measure Q, and get -1. So I need to find the probability that the first measurement yields 0 for P, and then the second measurement yields -1 for Q.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state collapses after each measurement. So after measuring P, the state is in an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue I measured. Then, measuring Q on that new state.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the projectors. Let me find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P.

Wait, operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3:0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, maybe I can find its eigenvalues.

The matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me denote it as:

[ 0       a       0 ]
[ a       0       a ]
[ 0       a       0 ]

Where a = 1/sqrt(2).

To find the eigenvalues, we solve det(P - λI) = 0.

The matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ      a       0 ]
[ a      -λ      a ]
[ 0       a     -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - a*a ] - a * [a*(-λ) - a*0 ] + 0 * (...) 

Wait, expanding the determinant:

= -λ [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (a^2) ) ] - a [ (a*(-λ) - a*0 ) ] + 0 * something.

So,

= -λ ( λ² - a² ) - a ( - a λ )

= -λ^3 + λ a² + a² λ

= -λ^3 + 2 a² λ.

Set this equal to zero: -λ^3 + 2 a² λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ (-λ² + 2 a²) ) = 0.

Solutions: λ = 0, or λ^2 = 2 a² → λ = ± a sqrt(2).

Since a is 1/sqrt(2), 2 a² = 2*(1/2) )=1. So λ^2 =1 → λ=1, -1.

Wait, wait: Let me compute a^2. a is 1/sqrt(2), so a^2 is 1/2. 2 a^2 is 1. So yes, λ^2 =1 → λ=1 or -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

So when you measure P, possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So first, the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

Wait, since the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), but we have to normalize it. So yes, the normalized state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

First measurement is P. Let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

So (P - 0 I)|v⟩ = 0 → P |v⟩ = 0.

So the system is:

0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

(1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3=0 → v2=0.

So from the first equation, v2=0.

From the third equation, same thing.

Second equation: v1 + v3 =0. So v3= -v1.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors of the form (v1, 0, -v1). So any vector proportional to (1, 0, -1). So the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T, up to normalization.

Let me check: Let me compute P multiplied by this vector.

P * [1,0,-1]^T.

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) *0 +0*(-1) =0.

Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) )= (1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2)) =0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) *0 +0*(-1) =0. So yes, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1]^T.

So when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ⟩ in this eigenvector.

So the eigenvector for P=0 is |e_0⟩ = [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2), because the norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is the inner product of |ψ⟩ and |e_0⟩.

So |ψ⟩ is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

|e_0⟩ is [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Their inner product is ( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)).

Wait, wait, actually, inner product is [ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) ) ] / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)).

Wait, which is (-1 -1) ) / (sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/ (2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The amplitude is -1/sqrt(3), so the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but that's the first part. Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |e_0⟩, which is [1,0,-1]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q. The operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1,0,-1.

So the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

The state after P measurement is |e_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

We need the probability of getting Q=-1.

So for Q, the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors.

Wait, because Q is diagonal: its eigenvectors are |e_1⟩ = [1,0,0]^T, |e_0⟩ = [0,1,0]^T, and |e_{-1}⟩ = [0,0,1]^T.

So when you measure Q, the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in each eigenstate.

So the state after P measurement is |e_0⟩ = (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Let's compute the amplitudes for each eigenstate of Q.

The component in |e_1⟩ ([1,0,0]^T) is (1 *1 ) + (0 *0 ) + ( (-1)*0 ) ) all divided by sqrt(2). So 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, the component in |e_{-1}⟩ is (0 *1 ) + (0 *0 ) + (1 * (-1) )) / sqrt(2) → (-1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait, the state is |e_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

So the inner product with |e_1⟩ is (1 *1 + 0 *0 + (-1)*0 ) / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2).

Similarly, inner product with |e_{-1}⟩ is (1*0 + 0 *0 + (-1)*1 ) / sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2).

The inner product with |e_0⟩ of Q (which is [0,1,0]^T) is (1*0 + 0*1 + (-1)*0 ) / sqrt(2) = 0.

So the probabilities are:

For Q=1: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

For Q=0: 0.

For Q=-1: ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )^2 = 1/2.

So when we measure Q after P=0, the probability of getting -1 is 1/2.

So the total probability is the product of the probabilities of the two independent measurements.

Wait, no, wait. The first step is measuring P=0, which has probability 1/3. Then, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the joint probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the answer should be D) 1/6.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Alternative approach: Since the measurements are in sequence, first P, then Q.

The joint probability is P(P=0) multiplied by P(Q=-1 | P=0).

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. So yes, that looks right.

Looking at the options, D is 1/6.


The state of the system is given as a column vector normalized to a unit vector: 

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} / \sqrt{6}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
|e_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the component of \( |\psi\rangle \) in \( |e_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right) / \sqrt{6} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( |e_0\rangle \). The observable \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |e_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |e_{-1}\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively.

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \) is determined by the square of the amplitude of \( |e_{-1}\rangle \) in \( |e_0\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The joint probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 | P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
