Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes at Paranal. The question is about the detectability of certain stars based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel after a one-hour exposure. The threshold is S/N of at least 10.

Each option gives a star with specific details. Let me list them out:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, V=15, RA=0, DEC=0
d) Star at 200 pc, V=15, same RA and DEC.
e) Star at 5 pc, same V, etc.
f) Star at 50 pc, V=15.

I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because the S/N depends on how bright the star appears to us. The formula for calculating apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, or is it m = M + 5 log(d/10)? Let me get that right. Oh yes, the formula is m = M + 5 log(d) -5, because d is in parsecs.

So for each star, I'll compute their apparent V magnitude.

Canopus (a): I think Canopus is a bright star. Oh wait, Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and has an apparent magnitude of about -0.7. So that's way brighter than the others. So m is about -0.7 for Canopus.

Polaris (b): I know Polaris is a variable star and is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2.0, but I'm not 100% sure. Or maybe a bit dimmer? Let me think. I remember it's not extremely bright, maybe around magnitude 1.8 to 2.5. Wait, no, I think it's about 2.0. Alternatively, perhaps 1.9? I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with m â‰ˆ 2.0 for now.

Now, the other stars (c, d, e, f) all have the same absolute magnitude (15) but different distances. Let's compute their apparent magnitudes.

c) 10 pc: m = 15 + 5 log(10) -5. Log(10) is 1, so m = 15 +5 -5 =15. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no: the formula is m = M +5*(log10(d)) -5. So for d=10, log10(10)=1, so m=15 + 5*(1) -5 =15. Oh, so m=15. That
