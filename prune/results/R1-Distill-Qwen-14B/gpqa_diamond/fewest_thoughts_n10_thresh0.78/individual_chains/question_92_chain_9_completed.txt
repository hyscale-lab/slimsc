Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how exactly do I approach this with the given data?

The molecule in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a branched molecule with some double bonds. I'll need to count the number of each type of bond to use the bond energy method.

Given data:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C) is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to produce atoms. So for carbon, that's the energy to break a C-C bond in graphite or something. But wait, in the problem, the bond energies are given for various C-C, C=C, etc., so maybe the atomization isn't directly needed here. Or is it part of calculating the bond energies?

Wait, the problem gives bond energies, so perhaps I don't need the atomization value. Or does it? Hmm, maybe not. Because bond energies are the energies required to break bonds in molecules. So if I'm calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, I'll sum the energies of the bonds broken and subtract the energies of bonds formed.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation could be calculated using the formula:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds) - (sum of enthalpies of formation of elements)

But wait, elements are in standard states, so their enthalpy of formation is zero. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing this with the bond energy approach. Alternatively, I've heard of using bond energies to estimate enthalpy of formation, especially for organic compounds where the structure is known.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy changes when the compound is formed from its constituent atoms. So, you calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (like C-C in graphite) and then form all the bonds in the compound.

Wait, but in this problem, the bond energies are given, so maybe the formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in elements) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in the compound)

Wait, no. Because the formation involves starting from elements. Let me think again. Elements like carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) are in their standard states. So, for carbon, the standard state is graphite, which has a certain structure, but maybe the problem abstracts this by considering the bond energies given.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its constituent atoms. So, we calculate the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (e.g., C-C bonds in graphite) and all the H-H bonds in hydrogen gas, and then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the compound are formed.

Wait, but in the problem, the given bond energies are for specific bonds (C-C, C=C, etc.), so perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds)] - [Σ (Bond energies of product bonds)] 

But wait, when forming the product, you start from elements, which have their own bonds. So, for each element, you have to break their bonds to get atoms. Then form the bonds in the product.

So, for carbon, if the element is graphite (C), each C atom is bonded to others. So to get one mole of C atoms, you need to break C-C bonds. Similarly for hydrogen, you have to break H-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C-C bonds in C atoms) × bond energy of C-C ) + (number of H-H bonds × bond energy of H-H) ] − [ (sum of all bond energies in the molecule) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

First, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider the molecule as a sum of all the bonds present. Let's see: each CH3 group contributes a certain number of C-H bonds. Then, the double bonds and single bonds between carbons.

Let me try to break down the structure:

The molecule is symmetric? Let's see: It has two (CH3)2C=CH- groups on each end, connected by a chain. Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each type of bond.

So, each carbon in the molecule is connected to other carbons and hydrogens. Let me count each type of bond:

1. C-C bonds: Let's see, how many single and double bonds are there?

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe the structure is: (CH3)2C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2, but with double bonds. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it, but I can't, so I'll try to count.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1,2-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene or something else. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 14 carbons? Wait, no, let me count them.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's count the carbons in each part.

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 4 carbons (two CH3, one C, and one CH)
- Then -CH2-CH(CH3): that's two more CH2 groups and one CH(CH3)
- Then -CH2-CH=C(CH3)2: that's two more CH2 groups and one C with two CH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead count each type of bond.

Counting all the single and double bonds in the molecule.

First, the C-C bonds: each single bond is a C-C single bond, each double bond is a C=C bond.

So, let's count all the C-C bonds.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has:

- (CH3)2C=CH: The structure is two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to a CH group.

So, for each (CH3)2C=CH, we have:

- The central C is connected to two CH3 groups (that's two C-C single bonds) and one CH group (another C-C single bond). Wait, no: the central C is connected to two CH3 (each C-C), and a double bond to the CH group. So the double bond is one C=C bond.

Wait, so the (CH3)2C=CH group has:

- Two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups).
- One C-C single bond to the CH.
- And a double bond (C=C) between the central C and the CH, making one C=C bond.

Wait, no, the central C is connected via a double bond to the adjacent C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each group, but perhaps I should count all the C-C single bonds and C=C bonds in the entire molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes:

- Two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups).
- One C=C bond (the double bond).
- One C-C single bond connecting to the next group.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to count all the bonds.

Let me try to count all the bonds in the molecule.

Each molecule has:

Number of C-C single bonds:
- Between each consecutive carbon atoms in the chain.

Let me count each:

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain is:

C1 (CH3)2C= C2 - C3 (CH2) - C4 (CH(CH3)) - C5 (CH2) - C6 (CH2) - C7 (CH=C(CH3)2).

Wait, perhaps that's 7 carbons. Maybe I should consider each C in the chain.

But perhaps a better approach is to count all the bonds in the molecule.

Let me list each type:

C-C single bonds:

- Each (CH3)2C group has two C-C single bonds (each CH3 has one C-C).
Wait, the central C in (CH3)2C is connected to two CH3 groups and double bonded to the next C. So, the (CH3)2C=CH group has two C-C single bonds (from the two CH3 groups) and one C=C double bond.

Then, between the (CH3)2C=C and the next CH2, there's a single bond.

Similarly, between CH2 and CH(CH3), another single bond.

Between CH(CH3) and CH2, another single bond.

Between CH2 and CH=C(CH3)2, another single bond.

Wait, let me count each C-C bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- contributes:

- Two C-C single bonds (from the two CH3 groups).
- One C=C double bond (the double bond between C and CH).
- One C-C single bond connecting to the next part.

Wait, but in the entire molecule, how many C-C single and double bonds are there?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes 2 C-C and 1 C=C.

Then, between the two (CH3)2C=CH groups, there are several single C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps trying to count all C-C bonds in the molecule:

Let me imagine the structure:

It's symmetrical, perhaps. Let's say it's a diene with two (CH3)2C=CH groups on each end.

Wait, the molecule could be (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain is: C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So, the C=C groups are at both ends.

Let me count each C-C bond:

1. Between the two ends: but perhaps it's better to count all.

Each C in the chain is connected to the next via a single bond, except where there are double bonds.

So, the molecule has:

- C1: connected via double bond to C2, and two single bonds to C3 and C4 (the two CH3 groups).
Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- implies that C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds), and a double bond to C2 (so a C=C bond).

Then, C2 is connected via a single bond to C3.

C3 is connected via single bonds to C4.

C4 is connected via single bond to C5.

C5 is connected via single bond to C6.

C6 is connected via a double bond to C7.

C7 is connected via single bonds to C8 and C9 (the two CH3 groups).

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 7 carbons in the main chain, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should just count the number of each bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each bond type:

- Number of C=C bonds: 2 (one at each end)
- Number of C-H bonds: Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds. Let's count all CH3 groups.

In the structure, each end has (CH3)2C=CH. So each end has two CH3 groups. So, that's 2×2=4 CH3 groups on each end? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So, each end has (CH3)2C=C, which contributes two CH3 groups. Then, in the middle, there's a CH(CH3) group, which has one CH3. So, let me count all CH3 groups:

- Each end: 2 CH3 groups → 2×2=4 CH3 groups.
- The middle CH(CH3): 1 CH3 group.
Wait, no, actually, the middle part is CH(CH3), which has one CH3.

Wait, but in the structure, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the groups are:

- (CH3)2C=CH- (left end)
- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 (right end)

Wait, perhaps the middle has a CH(CH3) group, which has one CH3, and the right end has a CH=C(CH3)2 group, which has two CH3 groups.

So, let me count CH3 groups:

- Left end: two CH3.
- Middle: CH(CH3) → one CH3.
- Right end: two CH3.
So total CH3 groups: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 CH3 groups.

Wait, each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds, so 5×3=15 C-H bonds.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Because the CH2 groups also have C-H bonds.

Wait, each CH2 group has two C-H bonds. Let's count all CH2 groups.

In the structure, how many CH2 groups are there?

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the groups are:

CH2 between CH and CH(CH3): that's one CH2.

Then, another CH2 between CH(CH3) and CH=C: that's another CH2.

So, two CH2 groups. Each has two C-H bonds → 2×2=4 C-H bonds.

Plus, any other CH2 groups?

Wait, the middle part is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 after the double bond: that's another CH2.

Wait, perhaps three CH2 groups. Let me recount:

Looking again:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → CH (connected via single bond)
2. CH2- → first CH2
3. CH(CH3)- → which has a CH3
4. CH2- → second CH2
5. CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are the ones after the double bond and between CH(CH3) and the next CH2.

So, two CH2 groups, each with two C-H bonds: 4.

Additionally, any other CH2 groups? Like in the middle?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a CH2 group. Let me think again. The structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the chain is:

C=C - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C.

So, the CH2 groups are between C=C and CH(CH3), and between CH(CH3) and CH=C.

So, two CH2 groups, each contributing two C-H bonds.

So, from CH2 groups: 2×2=4 C-H bonds.

Then, the other C-H bonds come from the CH groups.

In the structure, the CH groups are:

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH: that's one CH group with one C-H bond.
- The CH in the CH=C(CH3)2 group: another CH with one C-H bond.
Wait, but the structure is CH=C(CH3)2, which is a central C connected to two CH3 groups and a CH2 group. Or perhaps the CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 part is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, where the CH is bonded to the C=C.

Wait, perhaps the CH groups are the ones attached to the double bonds.

Each end has a CH group attached to the double bond.

Each CH has one C-H bond.

So, two C-H bonds from these CH groups.

Wait, but wait: each of the ends is C=C-CH2-... and ...-CH=C-.

Wait, perhaps in the structure, each C=C is connected to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I need to abandon trying to count from the structure and instead count each type of bond from the molecular formula.

The molecular formula can be determined by the structure. Let's see:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group contributes:

- (CH3)2C=CH has 4 carbons (two CH3, one C, and one CH).
So, each group contributes 4 carbons, and 4×1 = 4 hydrogen (each CH3 has 3 H, two CH3 → 6 H, the C has no H, the CH has 1 H; so total 6 + 1 =7 H per group? Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH has two CH3 (each 3 H), one C (no H?), and a CH with one H. So, H count: 3×2 +1 =7 H per group.

But perhaps this approach is getting me tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I should first determine the molecular formula, then count the bonds from there.

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group contributes 4 carbons and 7 hydrogens.

The middle part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH adds 4 carbons.

The middle part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, that's 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH(CH3)) + 1 (CH2) +1 (CH=C) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 6 carbons? Wait, no, perhaps I should count each C:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 4 C.
- Then, CH2 (1 C), CH(CH3) (1 C), CH2 (1 C), CH=C(CH3)2 (1 C, plus two CH3 groups). So, that's 4 + 1 +1 +1 +1 = 8 C? Hmm, but that may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps each (CH3)2C=C is a group, and the rest are connected in a chain. So, the molecule has two (CH3)2C=C groups, connected by a chain of CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me instead calculate the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has 4 C and 7 H.

Then, the chain in the middle is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Each -CH2- has 1 C and 2 H.

-CH(CH3) has 1 C and 4 H (the CH has one H, and the CH3 has 3 → total 4)
-CH2-CH2- → two more CH2 groups, each with 1 C and 2 H.

So, the middle chain (excluding the ends) has:

- CH2 → 1 C, 2 H.
- CH(CH3) → 1 C, 4 H.
- CH2 → 1 C, 2 H.
- CH2 → 1 C, 2 H.

Wait, perhaps that's four carbons in the middle, adding to the initial 4 from each end. So, 4 (each end) +4 (middle) → but wait, perhaps I'm double-counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has 10 carbons in total.

But perhaps it's better to calculate the molecular formula.

Let me count all the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group: 4 C.
Then, the middle part is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, perhaps that's 5 C, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each (CH3)2C=CH contributes 4 C, and the rest is:

CH2 (1 C) + CH(CH3) (1 C) + CH2 (1 C) + CH (1 C) + (CH3)2 (2 C). Wait, perhaps no.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end is (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end has 4 C.

The middle is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule has 10 carbons: 2 from each (CH3)2 group, 4 in the middle chain, and 4 in the ends.

But perhaps it's easier to count all the bonds.

Wait, regardless of the structure, maybe the approach is to calculate the total bond energy of all bonds broken in the elements and subtract the bond energy of all bonds formed in the molecule.

Wait, but the formula for estimating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds) 

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states (C and H2), and the product is the molecule.

So, for each element, you have to break their bonds to get the atoms, and then form the bonds in the molecule.

So, for carbon, each C atom comes from breaking C-C bonds in graphite. The bond energy for C-C is given as 200 kJ/mol. For hydrogen, each H atom comes from breaking H-H bonds (bond energy 100 kJ/mol).

But wait, in the given data, bond energies are provided for C-C, C=C, and C-H. So, perhaps we can proceed as follows:

1. Calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) to get their atoms.

2. Calculate the total energy released when the bonds in the product (molecule) are formed.

3. The enthalpy of formation is the sum from step 1 minus the sum from step 2, divided by the number of moles if necessary.

Wait, but the problem gives the bond energies per mole, so perhaps moles are already accounted for.

Wait, but let's think about the process:

To form one mole of the molecule, we start with the elements in their standard states (C and H2). We need to break all the bonds in these elements to get individual atoms, and then form the bonds in the molecule.

So, for carbon, each C atom in the molecule comes from breaking C-C bonds. So, how many C-C bonds are there in one mole of C (graphite)? Well, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. But perhaps in the standard state, we can consider it as a network of C-C bonds. So, for one mole of C atoms, we need to break (1/2) mole of C-C bonds because each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, for one mole of C atoms, (1/2) mole of C-C bonds are broken.

Similarly, for hydrogen, each H2 molecule has one H-H bond. To get two H atoms, one H-H bond is broken per mole of H2.

So, the steps are:

1. Break C-C bonds in graphite to get C atoms: for one mole of C atoms, we need to break 1/2 mole of C-C bonds. So, energy required is (1/2) * 1000 kJ/mol (since the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol).

Wait, wait, the bond energy of C-C is given as 200 kJ/mol. Oh, perhaps I got confused earlier. The bond energy is the energy per mole to break a bond. So, for each mole of C-C bonds, it's 200 kJ.

Wait, the atomization energy for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. That's the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of C (graphite) to produce one mole of C atoms. So, each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ.

Wait, but in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So, for each C atom, there are three C-C bonds, but each bond is shared between two atoms. So, the total number of C-C bonds in one mole of graphite is (3/2) moles. So, the energy to break all bonds in one mole of C would be (3/2) moles of C-C bonds × 200 kJ/mol = 300 kJ. But that's not matching the given atomization energy of 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things here.

Wait, perhaps the atomization energy provided is the energy to break all bonds in one mole of C (graphite) to produce one mole of C atoms. So, the atomization energy is 1000 kJ/mol. So, to get one mole of C atoms, you need to spend 1000 kJ.

Similarly, for H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So, to break one mole of H-H bonds, you need 100 kJ, which gives two moles of H atoms.

So, the approach is:

ΔHf° = [ (moles of C atoms × atomization energy of C ) + (moles of H atoms × (1/2) × bond energy of H-H) ) ] - [ sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule ]

Wait, but wait:

The enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf° = Σ (atoms' bond energies to break) - Σ (bonds formed in molecule)

But for each C atom, you need to break C-C bonds from graphite, which requires 1000 kJ per mole of C. So, for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ.

For H, each H atom comes from breaking H-H bonds. Each H2 molecule has one H-H bond, and bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. So, for each mole of H atoms, you need to break (1/2) mole of H-H bonds, which is 50 kJ per mole of H atoms.

So, for the molecule, we have to calculate the number of C atoms and H atoms.

Wait, but the molecule's formula can be determined from the structure. Let's find the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group contributes:

Each CH3 is CH3, so two CH3 groups → 2×3=6 H and 2 C.

The central C is bonded to the two CH3 and a CH group, so that's one more C.

The CH group has one H.

So, each (CH3)2C=CH group has 4 C and 7 H.

Then, the middle part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but perhaps the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each end is (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2. So, perhaps the molecule has:

Each end has (CH3)2C=C... and ...C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I should count all the C and H in the molecule.

Each (CH3)2C=CH has 4 C and 7 H.

The middle part: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

CH2 has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 4 H (the CH has 1, CH3 has 3), CH2 has 2 H, and CH=C has 1 H (from CH) and the C=C has two CH3 groups, each with 3 H → 6 H.

Wait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of each type of atom:

Carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has 4 C (two from the two CH3, one central C, and one from the CH).

The middle part:

- CH2 → 1 C
- CH(CH3) → 1 C
- CH2 → 1 C
- CH → 1 C
- C(CH3)2 → 1 C.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule has:

2*(4 C) from the two ends (each (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2) → 8 C.

Plus the middle part: CH2 (1) + CH(CH3) (1) + CH2 (1) + CH=C (1) → 4 C.

Total carbons: 8 +4 = 12 C?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the molecular formula as C14H24.

Wait, let me recount.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has:

- 2 CH3 → 2×3 H =6 H
- 1 C (central)
- 1 CH → 1 H.

So, 4 C and 7 H per group.

But the molecule has two such groups, so 8 C and 14 H.

Then, the middle part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H, so three CH2 groups would be 6 H.

CH(CH3) contributes 4 H (1 from CH, 3 from CH3).

The CH=C part: CH contributes 1 H, and the C=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups, each with 3 H → 6 H.

Wait, perhaps the middle part:

- CH2 has 2 H
- CH(CH3) has 4 H
- CH2 has 2 H
- CH=C has 1 H (from CH) and two CH3 groups (each 3 H) → 7 H.

So, middle part H: 2+4+2+7=15 H.

Plus the two end groups with 14 H → total H=14 +15=29? That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just look for the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH has 4 C and 7 H.

The middle part is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 contributes 1 C and 2 H.

CH(CH3) contributes 1 C and 4 H.

CH=C(CH3)2 contributes 1 C and 6 H (from the two CH3 groups) plus 1 H from the CH.

Wait, perhaps the middle part has:

CH2: 1 C, 2 H
CH(CH3): 1 C, 4 H
CH2: 1 C, 2 H
CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C, 1 H (from CH) + 6 H (from two CH3) → 7 H.

So the middle part contributes 4 C and (2+4+2+7)=15 H.

The two end groups contribute 8 C and 14 H.

So total C: 8 +4=12 C.

Total H: 14 +15=29 H.

But wait, that would make the formula C12H29, which doesn't make sense because the ends have (CH3)2C=CH and CH=C(CH3)2, which should contribute more H.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1,7-dimethyl-1,3,5,7-octatetraene or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by assuming the molecular formula and then count the bonds.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me proceed with what I have.

The formula for the molecule is C14H24, perhaps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by considering that each molecule has a certain number of each type of bond, regardless of the exact structure.

Wait, each molecule will have:

- A certain number of C-C single bonds
- A certain number of C=C double bonds
- A certain number of C-H bonds

So, the total enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = (sum of energy to break C-C bonds in graphite and H-H bonds in H2) - (sum of energy released when forming bonds in the molecule)

So, steps:

1. For each C atom in the molecule, break C-C bonds in graphite, which requires 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C atoms.

2. For each H atom, break H-H bonds, which requires 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2 molecules. Since each H2 gives two H atoms, the energy per H atom is 50 kJ.

So, the total energy to break bonds in elements is:

( moles of C × 1000 ) + ( moles of H × 50 )

Then, subtract the total bond energy in the molecule, which is:

( number of C-C single bonds × 200 ) + ( number of C=C double bonds × 300 ) + ( number of C-H bonds × 400 )

Wait, but wait: each C-C single bond in the molecule contributes 200 kJ/mol when broken, so when formed, it releases 200 kJ/mol. Similarly, each C=C bond releases 300 kJ/mol when formed, and each C-H releases 400.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × 1000) + (n_H × 50) ] - [ (n_C-C × 200) + (n_C=C × 300) + (n_C-H × 400) ]

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × atomization energy of C) + (n_H × (1/2) × bond energy of H-H) ) ] − [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

Which would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × 1000) + (n_H × 50) ] − [ (n_C-C × 200) + (n_C=C × 300) + (n_C-H × 400) ]

Yes, I think that's right.

So, to compute this, I need to find the number of C and H atoms in the molecule, and the number of each type of bond.

Let me proceed.

Assuming the molecular formula is C14H24.

Wait, but earlier counting suggested something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should just count the number of each bond from the structure.

But perhaps I'm stuck because I can't accurately count without knowing the exact structure. So, maybe I should proceed with the given options and see which makes sense.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 11200 kJ/mol → seems very high.

Option B: 67.4 kJ/mol → seems more reasonable.

Option C: 11.44 kJ/g → this is per gram, but the question asks for per mole.

Option D: 1900 kJ/g → same issue.

So, options C and D are probably wrong because they're per gram, but the question is per mole.

So, the correct answer is either A or B.

But wait, the problem statement says to calculate the enthalpy of formation, which is in kJ/mol.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, but how?

Let me think of an example.

Suppose the molecule is similar to an alkane, but with double bonds.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of each bond by considering the structure.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has:

- Two C-C single bonds (from the two CH3 groups)
- One C=C double bond
- One C-C single bond connecting to the next group.

So, for each group, 3 C-C single bonds and 1 C=C.

Then, the middle part has:

- CH2 groups with C-C single bonds.

Perhaps the molecule has 14 C-C single bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 14 C atoms and 24 H atoms.

So, n_C=14, n_H=24.

Now, calculate the bonds:

Assume the molecule has:

n_C-C = let's say 20 (a guess)
n_C=C = 2
n_C-H = 14×3 + other H's → but perhaps it's easier to compute.

Wait, each C can have up to four bonds. Let me think: the molecule has 14 C atoms, each with four bonds → total bonds = (14 ×4)/2 =28 bonds.

But that includes all bonds, including H bonds.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the formula and see.

So, if the molecule has 14 C and 24 H.

n_C =14, so energy to break C bonds: 14 ×1000 =14,000 kJ.

n_H =24 → energy to break H bonds: 24 ×50=1,200 kJ.

Total energy to break elements: 14,000 +1,200=15,200 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule.

Assume:

n_C-C = let's say 22 (just a guess)
n_C=C =2
n_C-H = (14×3) + (24 - (14×3)) → wait, no, each C can have up to four bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is 3×14=42? But that can't be, because the total H is 24.

Wait, no, each C can have a certain number of H bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-H bonds is 24, since each H is bonded to a C.

Wait, yes, because each H in the molecule is a C-H bond.

So, n_C-H=24.

Wait, but that can't be because each C can have up to four bonds. Let me think.

Wait, each H is a C-H bond, so n_C-H=24.

Then, the other bonds are C-C and C=C.

Total bonds in the molecule: (14 C ×4 bonds)/2 (because each bond connects two atoms) → 28 bonds.

Of these, 24 are C-H bonds, leaving 4 bonds. These 4 must be C-C and C=C bonds.

Assuming two C=C bonds (double bonds count as one bond each?), wait no. Each double bond is one bond but counts as two in bond energy.

Wait, no, the bond count is per single or double bond. For example, a C=C is one bond, but it's a double bond, so its energy is 300 kJ/mol.

So, for each C=C, it's counted once, but contributes 300 kJ.

So, if the molecule has 2 double bonds (C=C), then the remaining bonds are single C-C.

The total number of bonds is 28.

n_C-H=24.

So, the remaining bonds are 28-24=4.

These 4 are C-C and C=C.

Assume there are two C=C bonds → then the remaining 2 bonds are C-C.

So, n_C-C=2, n_C=C=2.

Now, compute the bond energies in the molecule:

n_C-C × 200 = 2 ×200=400 kJ
n_C=C ×300 = 2 ×300=600 kJ
n_C-H ×400 =24 ×400=9,600 kJ

Total bond energy in molecule: 400 +600 +9600=10,600 kJ.

So, the enthalpy of formation would be:

15,200 (breaking bonds) -10,600 (forming bonds) =4,600 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match that. So, perhaps my assumption about the number of bonds is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me try a different approach.

Assume that the molecule has 14 C atoms, and each C has four bonds, so total bonds are (14×4)/2=28.

n_C-H=24, as each H is a C-H bond.

So, remaining bonds: 28-24=4.

These 4 bonds can be C-C and C=C.

Let me assume that there are 2 C=C bonds and 2 C-C bonds.

So,

n_C-C=2 → 2×200=400 kJ
n_C=C=2 →2×300=600 kJ
n_C-H=24 →24×400=9,600 kJ
Total bonds: 400+600+9,600=10,600.

Enthalpy of formation: 15,200 -10,600=4,600 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps my assumption about the number of bonds is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Suppose 4 C=C bonds → but that would require 4×300=1,200 kJ.

But then the remaining bonds would be 28-24=4, so 4 bonds.

If 4 are C=C, then:

n_C=C=4 →4×300=1,200
n_C-C=0 →0
n_C-H=24 →9,600
Total: 1,200 +9,600=10,800.

ΔHf=15,200 -10,800=4,400 kJ/mol. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the count of C-C and C=C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 10 C-C bonds and 2 C=C bonds.

n_C-C=10 →10×200=2,000
n_C=C=2 →600
n_C-H=24 →9,600
Total: 2,000 +600 +9,600=12,200

ΔHf=15,200 –12,200=3,000 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 C atoms and 24 H atoms.

n_C=12 →12×1000=12,000 kJ.

n_H=24 →24×50=1,200 kJ.

Total breaking:13,200.

Now, bonds in molecule:

Assume 10 C-C bonds, 2 C=C bonds.

n_C-C=10 →200×10=2,000
n_C=C=2 →300×2=600
n_C-H=24 →400×24=9,600
Total bonds energy:2,000+600+9,600=12,200.

ΔHf=13,200–12,200=1,000 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 14 C and 20 H.

n_C=14 →14,000 kJ.

n_H=20 →20×50=1,000.

Total breaking:15,000.

Bonds in molecule:

Assume 12 C-C, 2 C=C, 20 C-H.

n_C-C=12 →200×12=2,400.
n_C=C=2 →300×2=600.
n_C-H=20 →400×20=8,000.
Total:2,400 +600 +8,000=11,000.

ΔHf=15,000–11,000=4,000. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the number of each bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 10 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, and 24 C-H bonds.

So, n_C-C=10 →2,000.
n_C=C=2 →600.
n_C-H=24 →9,600.
Total bonds: 2,000 +600 +9,600=12,200.

Breaking bonds:14,000 (C) + (24×50)=1,200 →15,200.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,200=3,000.

Still not matching the options. The only option close to this is option A (11,200), but I'm not getting that figure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, let me think: the molecule has 14 C atoms. Each C has four bonds, so total bonds (including all C-C and C-H) is (14×4)/2=28.

If the molecule has two C=C bonds (each counts as one bond but contributes 300), and the rest are C-C and C-H.

Each C=C bond is one bond, so 2 bonds → 2 bonds.

The remaining bonds are 28-2=26.

Of these 26, some are C-C and the rest are C-H.

Wait, but we have 24 C-H bonds (each H is on a C).

So, 24 C-H bonds → 24 bonds.

So, remaining bonds are 26-24=2 → which must be C-C bonds.

So, n_C-C=2, n_C=C=2, n_C-H=24.

So, bond energies:

C-C: 2×200=400
C=C: 2×300=600
C-H:24×400=9,600
Total: 400 +600 +9,600=10,600.

Breaking bonds:14×1000=14,000 (C) +24×50=1,200 (H) →15,200.

ΔHf=15,200 –10,600=4,600 kJ/mol.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm not considering all the bonds correctly.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds. Let me recount.

If the molecule has 14 C atoms, and two C=C bonds, then the number of C-C bonds would be (number of C atoms × (number of bonds per C) – number of double bonds ×2 – number of C-H bonds ×1) ) / 2.

Wait, each C has four bonds. So, total bonds from C: 14×4=56.

But each bond is shared between two atoms, so total bonds =56/2=28.

Now, of these 28 bonds:

- 2 are C=C (each is a single bond but with double bond energy)
- 24 are C-H
- The remaining are C-C bonds.

So, 28 –2 –24=2 → 2 C-C bonds.

So, yes, n_C-C=2.

So, the calculation remains as before: 4,600 kJ/mol, which is not an option.

But the options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in elements) – (sum of bond energies in compounds)

Wait, no, that would give a negative value, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies in product) – (sum of bond energies in reactants).

Wait, no, that would be the reverse of enthalpy change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of enthalpy of formation being the energy released when the bonds form, minus the energy required to break the elements' bonds.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of bonds in molecule ] – [sum of bond energies of elements' bonds ]

But wait, that would be the opposite, leading to negative values, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies in elements] – [sum of bond energies in molecule ]

Which would be the energy required to break elements minus the energy released when bonds form in the molecule.

So, in that case, 15,200 –10,600=4,600 kJ/mol.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the bond energies. Let me check the given data again.

Given data:

Bond energy of C-C =200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C=300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H=400 kJ/mol
Bond energy of H-H=100 kJ/mol.

So, each C-C bond contributes 200 kJ when broken, and when formed, releases 200 kJ.

Similarly, each C=C bond releases 300 kJ when formed.

Each C-H releases 400 kJ when formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C × 1000 ) + (n_H ×50) ] – [ (n_C-C ×200 ) + (n_C=C ×300 ) + (n_C-H ×400 ) ]

So, using the numbers from before, where n_C=14, n_H=24, n_C-C=2, n_C=C=2, n_C-H=24.

ΔHf = (14×1000) + (24×50) – [ (2×200) + (2×300) + (24×400) ]

=14,000 +1,200 – [400 +600 +9,600 ]

=15,200 –10,600=4,600 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Let me reevaluate the structure.

Looking again at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group has two CH3 groups attached to a central C, which is double-bonded to a CH group.

So, each end has:

(CH3)2C=CH → which has two C-C bonds (from the two CH3 groups), one C=C bond, and one C-C bond to the next CH2 group.

So, for each end, the number of C-C bonds is three.

Wait, no: the central C in (CH3)2C=CH is connected to two CH3 groups (two C-C bonds), a double bond to the CH group (counts as one bond), and a single bond to the next CH2 group (another C-C bond). So, that's three C-C bonds per end.

Wait, but in the middle, how many C-C bonds are there?

The CH2 groups connect to each other via single bonds.

So, perhaps for each (CH3)2C=CH group, there are three C-C bonds.

But given the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 10.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by counting all C-C and C=C bonds.

Each (CH3)2C=CH group contributes:

- Two C-C single bonds (from two CH3 groups)
- One C=C double bond
- One C-C single bond connecting to the next group.

So, each end contributes 3 C-C bonds and 1 C=C.

Then, the middle part has:

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH2 has a single C-C bond, and the CH groups may contribute more.

Wait, perhaps the middle has three C-C bonds: between CH2-CH(CH3), CH(CH3)-CH2, and CH2-CH=C.

So, three more C-C bonds.

So, total C-C bonds:

Each end: 3 → 2 ends →6

Middle:3 → total 9 C-C bonds.

Plus, two C=C bonds → total C-C bonds:9, C=C:2.

Wait, but earlier calculation said 2 C-C bonds, which doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the total C-C bonds are 9 and C=C are 2.

So, n_C-C=9, n_C=C=2.

n_C-H=24.

So, ΔHf=(14×1000)+(24×50) – [9×200 +2×300 +24×400 ]

=14,000 +1,200 – [1,800 +600 +9,600 ]

=15,200 – (12,000) =3,200 kJ/mol.

Still no match with options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcounting C-C bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 14 C atoms, so perhaps n_C=14.

n_H=24.

n_C-C=10.

n_C=C=2.

n_C-H=24.

So, the bond energies:

10×200=2,000.

2×300=600.

24×400=9,600.

Total:12,200.

Breaking bonds:14×1000=14,000.

n_H=24 →24×50=1,200.

Total breaking:15,200.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,200=3,000 kJ/mol.

Still no option matches.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option B is 67.4 kJ/mol.

If I divide 4,600 by 68, I get roughly 67.6 kJ/g, but the option is per mole.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C14H24.

So, n_C=14, n_H=24.

If I use that, then:

Breaking bonds:

14×1000=14,000.

24×50=1,200.

Total:15,200.

Now, bonds in molecule:

n_C-C= let's say 10.

n_C-C=10 →10×200=2,000.

n_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

n_C-H=24 →24×400=9,600.

Total: 2,000 +600 +9,600=12,200.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,200=3,000.

But that's not option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 C-C bonds, 2 C=C, and 24 C-H.

So:

12×200=2,400.

2×300=600.

24×400=9,600.

Total:12,600.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,600=2,600.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is B)67.4 kJ/mol. But I'm not seeing how to reach that number.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is C10H16, which is a common structure.

n_C=10, n_H=16.

Breaking bonds:

10×1000=10,000.

16×50=800.

Total:10,800.

Assume the molecule has 8 C-C, 2 C=C, and 16 C-H bonds.

n_C-C=8 →8×200=1,600.

n_C=C=2 →600.

n_C-H=16 →6,400.

Total bonds:1,600+600+6,400=8,600.

ΔHf=10,800 –8,600=2,200.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has fewer bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is smaller. Let's assume it's C8H12.

n_C=8 →8×1000=8,000.

n_H=12 →12×50=600.

Total breaking:8,600.

Assuming bonds:

n_C-C=6 →6×200=1,200.

n_C=C=2 →600.

n_C-H=12 →4,800.

Total bonds:1,200+600+4,800=6,600.

ΔHf=8,600 –6,600=2,000.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 14 C and 20 H.

n_C=14 →14,000.

n_H=20 →1,000.

Total breaking:15,000.

Bonds:

n_C-C=10 →2,000.

n_C=C=2 →600.

n_C-H=20 →8,000.

Total bonds:10,600.

ΔHf=15,000 –10,600=4,400.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another way to estimate enthalpy of formation is to use the formula:

ΔHf° = [ (Σ Bond energies of elements) ] – [ Σ Bond energies of compound ]

But perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = ( sum of bond energies of reactant bonds ) - ( sum of bond energies of product bonds )

But reactants are the elements in their standard states, and product is the compound.

So, for the reactants, C (graphite) and H2.

The bond energy for C in graphite is 200 kJ/mol (C-C), and H-H is 100 kJ/mol.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the enthalpy of formation as the sum of the energies required to break the bonds in the elements to form the atoms, minus the energies released when forming the bonds in the compound.

So, for each mole of C, 1000 kJ is needed (atomization).

For each mole of H2, 100 kJ is needed to break into 2 H atoms.

So, for the molecule, if it has 14 C and 24 H:

Total energy to break elements:

14×1000 (C) + (24/2)×100 (H) → because each H2 gives 2 H.

So:

14×1000 =14,000.

24 H atoms come from 12 moles of H2 →12×100=1,200.

Total:15,200 kJ.

Now, bonds formed in the molecule:

Assume the molecule has:

n_C-C=10 →10×200=2,000.

n_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

n_C-H=24 →24×400=9,600.

Total bonds:2,000+600+9,600=12,200.

So, enthalpy of formation is 15,200 –12,200=3,000 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds.

If n_C-C=12, then:

12×200=2,400.

n_C=C=2 →600.

n_C-H=24 →9,600.

Total= 12,600.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,600=2,600.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has more C=C bonds.

n_C=C=4 →4×300=1,200.

n_C-C=8 →8×200=1,600.

n_C-H=24 →9,600.

Total=12,400.

ΔHf=15,200 –12,400=2,800.

Still no match.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the given options are incorrect, but since I have to choose from them, perhaps the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not seeing how to reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies in the product - sum of bond energies in the reactants.

Which would give:

12,200 –15,200= -3,000 kJ/mol.

But that would be negative, which doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reverse.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total bond energy in the molecule, subtract from the bond energy required to break the elements.

But I'm getting stuck.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The only plausible option that could be correct is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, perhaps if the calculation yields around 67 kJ.

But I can't see how to get that number.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms.

If the molecule has 16 C atoms, then:

n_C=16 →16×1000=16,000.

n_H=24 →1,200.

Total breaking:17,200.

Bonds in molecule:

n_C-C=14 →14×200=2,800.

n_C=C=2 →600.

n_C-H=24 →9,600.

Total=13,000.

ΔHf=17,200 –13,000=4,200.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)67.4 kJ/mol, and I must have made a mistake in counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the molecule has more double bonds, leading to a higher bond energy in the molecule, thus a lower ΔHf.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'm stuck.

Since the options are limited, and considering that option B is the only plausible one left, I'll go with option B.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given molecule, the bond energy method was used. The enthalpy of formation is determined by the energy required to break bonds in the reactants (elements in their standard states) and the energy released when forming bonds in the product (the molecule). The formula used is:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \left[ (\text{moles of C} \times 1000) + (\text{moles of H} \times 50) \right] - \left[ (\text{number of C-C bonds} \times 200) + (\text{number of C=C bonds} \times 300) + (\text{number of C-H bonds} \times 400) \right]
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the molecular formula**: The molecule is symmetric, and its structure suggests it has 14 carbon atoms and 24 hydrogen atoms, giving the molecular formula \( \text{C}_{14}\text{H}_{24} \).

2. **Energy to break bonds in elements**:
   - For carbon: \( 14 \times 1000 = 14,000 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - For hydrogen: \( 24 \times 50 = 1,200 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total energy to break bonds in elements: \( 14,000 + 1,200 = 15,200 \, \text{kJ} \).

3. **Energy released when forming bonds in the molecule**:
   - The molecule was assumed to have:
     - \( n_{\text{C-C}} = 10 \) bonds: \( 10 \times 200 = 2,000 \, \text{kJ} \),
     - \( n_{\text{C=C}} = 2 \) bonds: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ} \),
     - \( n_{\text{C-H}} = 24 \) bonds: \( 24 \times 400 = 9,600 \, \text{kJ} \).
   - Total energy released: \( 2,000 + 600 + 9,600 = 12,200 \, \text{kJ} \).

4. **Calculate enthalpy of formation**:
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ = 15,200 - 12,200 = 3,000 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)**: This value is too high and does not match the calculated result.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This value is significantly lower than the calculated result and does not align with the bond energy method.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)** and **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: These are per gram values, but the question asks for enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol, making these options irrelevant.

Given the calculations and the provided options, none of the values match the computed result of \( 3,000 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). However, based on the structure of the problem and the plausible range of values, **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)** is selected as the most reasonable answer, despite discrepancies in the calculation.
