Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen bromide (HBr) is commonly involved in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. Oh wait, the compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me visualize that structure.

So the molecule structure: it's a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure would look like OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait no, butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, butene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait that can't be right because the double bond can't be after the third carbon in a four-carbon chain. Oh wait, butenyl would be four carbons in total. So numbering from the end, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait no, that would be but-1-en-4-yl or something. I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: so the substituent is attached at the first carbon, and the double bond starts at the third carbon. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that would mean the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at
