Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a reaction where a specific compound is treated with hydrogen bromide, and then they checked the reaction progress using TLC. The result shows that the reactant spot has gotten smaller, and two new spots have appeared. I need to figure out which of the options (A, B, C, D) correctly identifies the products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an oxygen attached, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. The substituents on the butenyl are two methyl groups on carbon 2. So the structure would look like a benzene ring with O- attached to a CH2 group, then a CH(CH2CH3) [Wait, no. Let me think again. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in between? Wait no, the buten-3-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl. So the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the structure is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, the butenyl group is but-3-en-1-yl, so the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the substituents are on the second carbon. Oh wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

The substituents are 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl group has four carbons. The double
