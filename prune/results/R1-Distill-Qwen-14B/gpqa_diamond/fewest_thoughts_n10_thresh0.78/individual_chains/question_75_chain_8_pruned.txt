Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a scientist trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. The construct they made includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. They're trying to figure out why.

The sequence provided is the plus strand of their construct. So, I need to look at this DNA sequence and see if there's any issue that would prevent the correct expression of the protein.

Let me think about the possible options. The options are A to D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, the problem says they introduced the HA tag sequence. If the HA sequence was mutated, the tag wouldn't bind properly, but would that prevent expression? Maybe, but if the HA is at the N-terminus, but the rest of the coding sequence is intact, the protein might still be expressed but not recognized by the antibody. But in this case, the issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So maybe the HA isn't the problem.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon somewhere in the sequence. Let me check the provided DNA sequence. Wait, DNA is written 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be the complementary sequence, and the reading frame would be in the same direction.

Looking through the DNA sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons. Let me think about the possible stop codons in the mRNA, which are UAA, UAG, and UGA. So looking for those triplets in the DNA.

Wait, the DNA strand is the coding (plus) strand, so the mRNA will be complementary. So for example, the DNA sequence is ATG..., so the mRNA starts with AUG, which is a start codon.

I'll scan the DNA for sequences that would correspond to stop codons in the mRNA. Let's see:

Looking at the sequence, I'll go through and check for any triplet that would be a stop. Let's see:

Looking for TAA in DNA (since mRNA is complementary, TAA in DNA becomes UAA in mRNA, which is a stop). Similarly, TAG in DNA is UAG, and TGA in DNA is UGA.

Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, which is correct for a start codon. Now, let me search for any of these three stop codon signals in the mRNA.

Wait, looking through the DNA sequence, looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Let me go through the sequence in chunks, looking for these.

Looking at the sequence:

5'ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... etc.

Wait, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA. Let's see:

The first part is ATG TAC... Hmm. Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is correct.

Looking further: ...CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA...

So, the part is CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ...

Looking at TTA: in DNA, that's TTA, which in mRNA would be AUG. Not a stop. Then AGA is AGA, which is arginine. Next, TTA is TTA in DNA → UUA in mRNA, which is a leucine. Then CGC is CGC → CGC, which is arginine. CAA is CAA → GAA, which is glutamic acid.

Wait, maybe I should look for the actual stop codons in the mRNA. So let's look for triplet in the DNA sequence that, when transcribed into mRNA, becomes UAA, UAG, or UGA.

So, for example, the DNA sequence has 'TAC' which is TAC → mRNA is AUG, which is a start. Hmm, not a stop.

Looking through: ...GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

Wait, I see 'CAG' in the DNA. CAG in DNA is CAG → mRNA is GAG, which is glutamic acid. Not
