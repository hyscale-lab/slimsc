Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and then about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Oh wait, the question gives two parts, A and B, which I need to determine.

The first part (A) is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I think tautomerism involves the shifting of a hydrogen and the adjacent atom's double bond, like in ketones and aldehydes. But wait, tautomerism usually occurs when there's an acidic hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group because the compound can form an enol or keto form. So, if a compound doesn't have such a structure, it won't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone structure. I think quinones have two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring. So each carbonyl is attached to an aromatic ring. If they're directly attached, will they tautomerize? Can they form enol forms? But wait, aromatic rings might stabilize the structure, making tautomerism less likely. Alternatively, if the structure is such that the carbonyl groups are conjugated with the aromatic ring, like in para-benzoquinone, maybe they can't tautomerize because there's no adjacent hydrogen to shift. Or perhaps because the ring structure doesn't allow for the necessary hydrogen movement.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. Each of these carbonyls is attached to a CH2 group, perhaps. So each of these ketones could potentially undergo tautomerism because each has a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the cyclohexane trione might show tautomerism. But wait, if all the carbonyl groups are in such a symmetric arrangement, maybe tautomerism isn't possible due to lack of hydrogen or something else?

Wait, what's tautomerism again? It's a special case of isomerism where two functional groups transfer a hydrogen. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism. So, the compound must have a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group. Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is connected to an oxygen and two benzene carbons. Benzene rings are sp² hybridized. So each carbonyl carbon is connected to two carbons from the ring. The adjacent carbons to each ketone are in the ring, so maybe they don't have hydrogens. Like, in para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Each ring carbon is connected to another ring carbon, so maybe the carbonyl carbons are attached to two other carbons and an oxygen. Wait, no, the carbonyl group is R-O-C-O-R? No, that's not right. Benzoquinone is a 1,4-diketone on benzene. So each of the two carbonyl groups is attached to two carbons from the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl group is directly attached to the ring, which is sp² hybridized, so those adjacent carbons (the ring carbons) don't have any hydrogens. Because the carbon next to the carbonyl is part of the aromatic ring and doesn't have any hydrogens attached. So, no alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is attached to a CH2 group (like, the ring is cyclohexane with each ketone at a position where the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups). So each of these carbonyls has alpha hydrogens. For example, the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO, but arranged in a ring. So each ketone has two alpha hydrogens. Therefore, this compound can undergo tautomerism, meaning it can form enol tautomers. So which one doesn't show tautomerism? Benzoquinone doesn't, so A is benzoquinone. So A should be the compound without tautomerism.

Moving on to part B: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center—meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon.

Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is: the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, and when esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by OMe. So the structure becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, I think. Let me draw this. The propanoate part is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on the second carbon: the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, but propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- when deprotonated. So the ester would be methyl ester, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) has: a methyl group (from the first carbon), a hydroxyl, a carbonyl group, and a methyl ester group. Wait, no, the carbons are: the first is CH3, second is CH(OH), third is COOCH3. So the second carbon has groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. The structure would be:
