Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember from my basic particle physics that pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles.

The problem states that a Pi+ is at rest and decays into a mu+ and a neutrino (nu). The given masses are: Pi+ has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the mu+ is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino's mass? I think neutrinos are super light, almost massless, especially in these kinds of problems. So I'll probably treat it as zero.

So the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the muon's momentum.

I remember that in decay problems, energy and momentum conservation are key. So let's think about the energy first. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy. The neutrino, being massless, will have energy equal to its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, which is probably the case here, energy is just equal to momentum). So, let me set up the equations.

Let me denote the muon's kinetic energy as KE_mu, and the neutrino's kinetic energy as KE_nu. But wait, neutrino's rest mass is zero, so all its energy is kinetic. So, the muon's total energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu*c² + KE_mu. Since we're working in MeV and c=1, E_mu = 105.7 + KE_mu.

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu * c. Again, since c=1, E_nu = p_n
