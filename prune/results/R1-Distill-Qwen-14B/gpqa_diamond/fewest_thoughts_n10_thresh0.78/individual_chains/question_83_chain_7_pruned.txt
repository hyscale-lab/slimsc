Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form sodium acetate and water. The reaction should look something like this: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

The problem says we start by diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so hopefully, I can work through each part.

First, let's tackle the initial solution after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes, the concentration of acetic acid will be halved. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you use M1V1 = M2V2. So initial moles of acetic acid are M1 * V1. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, 0.04 L. So new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, no, wait again. Wait, 20 cm³ of acetic acid and 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. So yeah, 0.025 M acetic acid.

But wait, actually, when you dilute 20 mL of 0.05 M with 20 mL of water, the concentration becomes half because the volume doubles.
