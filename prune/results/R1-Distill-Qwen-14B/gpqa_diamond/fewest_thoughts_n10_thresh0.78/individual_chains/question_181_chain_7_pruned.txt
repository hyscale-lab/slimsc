Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are still going as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, first, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of solar energy. The pp-III branch is a specific part of this chain, right? Oh yeah, the proton-proton chain has several branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, but there's also pp-II and pp-III. PP-III involves a triple-alpha reaction maybe? Or wait, no, that's more like the CNO cycle. No, wait, the triple-alpha is part of the CNO perhaps? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the pp chain produces helium-4 from protons. The main pp-I branch produces two positrons and two neutrinos. The pp-II branch involves a different intermediate. Oh, and the pp-III branch, I think, is when a proton captures on helium-3, producing helium-4 and a gamma photon. Wait, no, the pp chain starts with two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton to form helium-3.
