Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically through the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think that's the right approach. So first, I need to find the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius the Schwarzschild radius.

The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon at a distance d. Angular size, θ, is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians because the formula for the radius of the event horizon in terms of angular size probably uses radians. Oh right, the formula is θ ≈ r / d, where r is the Schwarzschild radius and d is the distance. But wait, that's an approximation when θ is small, which it is here (1e-17 degrees, which is tiny). So I can use θ ≈ r/d to find r.

So first, converting θ from degrees to radians. Since 1 degree is π/180 radians, θ_radians = θ_deg * π / 180. Plugging in θ=1e-17 degrees: θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is roughly 1.74e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ r/d, so r = θ * d. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is θ (in radians) = r / d, so r = θ * d. So r equals theta (in radians) multiplied by distance d.

Wait, but wait, the distance d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert that into meters because the Schwarzschild radius is in meters. So 1 parsec
