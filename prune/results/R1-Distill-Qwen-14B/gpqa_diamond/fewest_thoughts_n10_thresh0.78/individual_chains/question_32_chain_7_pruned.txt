Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. So the mass number is 6.

The problem states that the speed v is 0.96c. I need to find the energy of the nucleus at this speed. I think I'll need to use the relativistic energy equation. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 c².

But wait, what's gamma? Oh yeah, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I should compute gamma first.

Given v = 0.96c, let's plug that in. So v² = (0.96c)² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is about 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes. So gamma is about 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784). Let's see, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, so that's correct. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857 approximately.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, I should find the exact mass in kg or convert it into energy using the appropriate constant.

Wait, 1 atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the mass of Li-6 is 6 u, which is 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 9.9632343996e-27 kg.

The rest mass energy E0 is m0 c². The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So E0 = 9.9632343996e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating that: (3e8)^2 is 9e16. So 9.9632343996e-27 kg * 9e16 m²/s². Let me compute that:

Multiply 9.9632343996e-27 by 9e16. 9.963234e-27 *9e16 = 8.96691095964e-10 J. Wait, but that's in joules. I need to convert it to GeV because the options are in GeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.60218e-10 J. So to convert joules to GeV, I divide by 1.60218e-10 J/GeV.

So E0 = 8.96691095964e-10 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈ let's compute that.

8.96691095964e-10 / 1.60218e-10 = (8.96691095964 / 1.60218) ≈ approximately 5.6 GeV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6 u would be about 5.589 GeV. Oh, right! So maybe I can use that shortcut. 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV, so 6 u is 6
