Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices, specifically for a qubit. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But wait, what's the question again? It says, "What is its geometrical position in the qubits space?" Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh wait, I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors, and adding them gives the identity matrix for a qubit. So ρ would be (1/2)I, since |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix for a 2x2 system. So ρ is (1/2)I, which means each diagonal element is 1/2 and the off-diagonal elements are zero.

But the question is about the geometrical position. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, where the coordinates are (x, y, z). The Bloch sphere comes to mind. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The density matrix ρ can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So the general form is ρ = (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

In this problem, ρ is (I)/2. So that means the off terms (r_x, r_y, r_z) must be zero because when you add r_x σx, etc., they don't contribute. So the equation becomes (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which matches the given ρ.

So the Bloch vector r has components (0, 0, 0). Wait, but wait a second. What's the Bloch sphere position when the vector is at the origin? Oh right, that's the completely mixed state. Because pure states are on the surface, and the completely mixed state is at the center. So this state is the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the north pole, probably corresponding to the state |0>, but in pure state. But wait, our state is
