Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal structure has all sides equal and all angles equal. So the lattice is a cube that's been distorted by the same amount in all directions. The interatomic distance here is given as 10 Angstroms, which I think refers to the length of the edges of the unit cell—so a, b, and c are all 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees, which is quite a sharp angle.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember there's a formula called the interplanar spacing formula for crystals. Oh right, it's d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh) \cos \alpha}}} or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Let me think. Oh wait, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that's for a simple cubic structure with angles 90 degrees. Since this is a rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, rhombohedral is a subclass of cubic systems but with angles not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, no, no—rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal, but not 90 degrees. So the formula must account for the lattice angles.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of squares, but adjusted for the angles. The formula is d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / a^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + kl \cos\beta + lh \cos\alpha) / (a^2) } } }, but wait, no, maybe I need to think differently. Or perhaps it's better to approach it using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, another approach: The
