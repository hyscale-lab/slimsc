Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which one has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D which correspond to those options.

Wait, right. Density is mass divided by volume. So higher density means either more mass, less volume, or both. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So since Earth's density is known, I think it's about 5.5 g/cm³. So option a's density is 5.5, right?

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait a second, if the density is given as 5.5, does that mean that's the actual density of the planet? So regardless of mass, the density is fixed. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth. So if Earth's density is 5.5, then this planet should have the same density too, because density is mass/volume, and if composition is same, the density remains same. So Earth's mass is M, radius R. So the volume of Earth is (4/3)πR³. Now, if the planet is 5 times more massive but same radius? Wait, no. Wait, same composition would imply same density, so if it's more massive,
