Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions from the given options.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. So, benzene ring with substituents. Let's see: the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So numbering starts with the ethoxy group as position 1. Then, moving around the ring, position 2 is t-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. Wait, but that's three substituents on adjacent positions, which might complicate things.

But wait, in benzene, substituents can be in any positions. But how are they arranged? Let's think: ethoxy at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So they're all meta to each other? No, because 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. So they're adjacent in a row. Hmm, that might be a bit complicated in terms of directing effects.

Wait, but maybe the order in which the substituents are added will determine their positions. Since benzene is symmetric, the initial substitution will determine where the next groups go.

So, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me think about the order in which these groups should be introduced to get the correct positions.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions. For example, nitro is a strong meta-directing group because it's deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group, which is ortho/para-directing. The t-butyl group is a bulky, activating
