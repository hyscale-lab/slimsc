Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out where the peaks would disappear when using PFA+DSG fixation. Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is a method used to determine the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So the process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the DNA attached, and then sequencing it.

The question says that when they did ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells, they got some peaks. But when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. I'm trying to think about what PFA and DSG do in the fixation process.

PFA stands for paraformaldehyde. I remember that PFA is a crosslinking agent. It's usually used to fix proteins to DNA, making sure they stay attached during the experimental process. So, PFA alone crosslinks things. But why would they add DSG as well?

DSG is dithiothreitol, I think. Oh wait, DSG is a reducing agent. It's often used in the context of crosslinking. Oh right! I think that PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA, but sometimes proteins are crosslinked to each other or to other structures in the chromatin. DSG can help reduce these crosslinks by breaking disulfide bonds, making the crosslinking less extensive. So PFA+DSG would lead to a more gentle crosslinking compared to just PFA alone.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. PFA is a methionaldehyde fixative that primarily crosslinks proteins to DNA and to each other. DSG is a strong reducing agent that can break some crosslinks. So when we use PFA with DSG, it might not crosslink as strongly, maybe allowing certain regions to be more fragmented or not as thoroughly crosslinked.

In ChIP-seq, the crosslinking efficiency is crucial. If the crosslinking is too strong, maybe it's harder to shear the DNA into small fragments. Or perhaps regions that are more sensitive to the crosslinking agents are lost when the crosslinking conditions are changed.

So the question is about peaks disappearing when using PFA+DSG. The peaks were present with just PFA. So the PFA+DSG treatment is causing the loss of these peaks. Why
