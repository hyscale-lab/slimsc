Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis is a reaction where the positions of substituents are exchanged, usually involving alkenes. Oh right, ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by connecting two alkenes.

The question is about synthesizing 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me visualize this structure. Cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are isopropyl at position 5 and methyl groups at 3 and 4.

Wait, so the starting material must undergo a metathesis that brings two double bonds together to form the ring. Oh wait, no, I think ring-closing metathesis uses a single diene and a catalyst, like Grubbs, to form a ring by connecting two ends with double bonds. Oh wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Ring-closing metathesis typically involves a diene, but wait, no. Metathesis is about breaking and reforming double bonds. So, the starting material is an alkyne? No, no, alkenes. Oh, the starting material has two double bonds, or maybe a diene, so that when metathesis occurs, a ring forms.

Wait, no, wait. For ring-closing metathesis, you usually have a diene with two double bonds or a diene where the ends can form a ring when the double bonds shift.

Wait, no. Another approach: ring-closing metathesis usually involves a single diene. The catalyst would cause the ends to come together, forming a ring and a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the positions where the metathesis will occur. The product is cyclohexene, so the ring is six-membered. So, the starting material is an octadiene, maybe, which would form a six-membered ring upon metathesis.

Wait, let's think about the product structure. The cyclohexene has substituents at positions 3,4, and 5. So, numbering the ring, the substituents at 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). So, the double bond is at position 1, meaning between C1 and C2.

So, when we perform ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must have two double bonds that are in positions such that when they undergo metathesis, the ring forms, and the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene with substituents in such a way that when the ends are joined, the substituents are placed correctly.

Wait, let me sketch this out. Let's imagine the product is a cyclohexene with substituents on carbons 3,4,5. So, in the ring, the substituents would be at those positions. The substituents in the starting material must be positioned such that after ring closure, they end up at the correct positions.

So, the starting material is an octadiene. Let's imagine that the starting material is an 8-carbon molecule with two double bonds, or perhaps a single diene that can form a ring when the catalyst does its thing.

Wait, no. Ring-closing metathesis typically uses a diene to form a ring. So, the starting material is an 8-carbon diene. Let's say positions 1 and 7 have double bonds, or something like that.

Wait, let's think about the positions. To form a 6-membered ring (cyclohexene), the starting diene would have to have the double bonds in positions that are 5 apart, perhaps. Because when the ends are joined, the ring is formed.

Wait, more accurately, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and rearranges the ends. So, the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are spaced such that connecting the ends forms a 6-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the diene is in positions 1 and 7 of an 8-carbon chain. So, the molecule is octa-1,7-diene. When metathesis occurs, the ends (positions 1 and 7) form a ring by connecting, which would form a cyclohexene.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is a diene, say, octa-1,7-diene. It has two double bonds at 1 and 7. But wait, that's actually two separate double bonds. No, wait, wait. No, I think for ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is a diene, meaning a single conjugated diene, not two separate double bonds.

Wait, no, perhaps a diene with two double bonds that are not conjugated. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mono-alkene, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the ring is six-membered, with substituents at 3,4,5. The double bond is between 1 and 2.

So, the cyclohexene has substituents on carbons 3 (CH3), 4 (CH3), and 5 (i-Pr). So, the substituents in the ring are in positions 3,4,5.

Now, the starting material must have these substituents in such a way that when ring-closing metathesis occurs, they end up in those positions. So, perhaps the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with substituents in positions that will become 3,4,5 when the ring forms.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. Let's number this octadiene from 1 to 8. So, the substituents are at 3 (CH3), 4 (CH3), 5 (i-Pr). The double bonds are between 1-2 and 7-8.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst (like Grubbs) would cause the ends of the diene to form a new double bond, and the existing double bonds would rearrange.

Wait, but in metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bonds and swaps ends. So, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The catalyst would perform a [2+2] cycloelimination, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mono-alkene, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's model the reaction. Ring-closing metathesis forms a ring by connecting two ends of an olefin. So, the starting material must have two double bonds, but that doesn't make sense, because metathesis usually involves breaking and reforming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents positioned such that when the ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

So, the starting material is an octadiene, let's say 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So, the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

In the metathesis, the catalyst would break both double bonds, reorganize the ends, and form a new double bond in the ring.

Wait, but how does that work? Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene in which one double bond is in a position that, when the ends are connected, forms the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two ends (positions 1 and 7) are connected via metathesis to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the chain is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. An 8-carbon diene with double bonds at 1 and 7.

So, structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, that's not 8 carbons. Wait, octa means 8 carbons. So, 1 and 7 positions would be the first and last carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH(CH2)...) Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So, structure is:

Positions 1-8:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2?) Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the substituents are 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl. So, the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5.

Wait, starting material is an octadiene, which after ring-closing becomes cyclohexene. So, the starting material must have substituents in positions that, when the ends come together, become the substituents on the six-membered ring.

So, in the starting material, carbons 3,4,5 will correspond to carbons 3,4,5 in the ring. So, the starting material is an 8-carbon chain with substituents on 3,4,5.

Wait, but the ring is 6-membered, so the starting material must have 8 carbons, because when you form a ring with 6 members, you lose two carbons as part of the ring? No, wait, not exactly. Let's think of the chain as 8 carbons with double bonds at positions 1 and 7. When you perform ring-closing metathesis, you form a six-membered ring, so the chain would have to have 8 - 2 = 6? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents, such that when the ends are joined, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Let me think about the product structure.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

The substituents:

C3: methyl

C4: methyl

C5: isopropyl

Now, in the starting material, which is a diene, the substituents are at positions that, when the ring is formed, they end up at 3,4,5.

So, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are at positions that are 3,4,5 in the chain.

Wait, but the starting material is an octadiene, which will form a cyclohexene when the ends are connected. So, the starting material is 8 carbons, and the product is 6. So, perhaps the starting material has 8 carbons in a chain, and two of them (the ends) are connected to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene with the substituents in such a way that when the ends are connected, the substituents end up on the correct positions.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So, the chain has 8 carbons, with double bonds at 1 and 7 positions (so at each end). The substituents are at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (i-Pr).

So, when the ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst will cause the two double bonds to react. How? The Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking and re-forming of double bonds.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes (dienes) at the ends of the chain undergo metathesis, leading to the formation of a ring. So, the ends (the double bonds at 1 and 7) would react to form a new double bond in the ring.

In this process, the substituents from the ends (like 1 and 7) would become part of the ring. Wait, but in the product, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So, perhaps the substituents in the starting material are placed so that when the ends are connected, the substituents fall into those positions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material looks like this:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)

4: CH(CH3)

5: CH(CH(CH3)2) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think step by step.

The product is a six-membered ring. So, the starting material must have a chain with substituents in such a way that when the ends are joined, the substituent positions are correct.

The product substituents are at 3,4,5. So, in the starting material, these substituents are located in positions that, when the chain is connected end to end, they fall into the correct positions.

For example, in the starting material, substituent 3 would be at position 3 of the chain, which, after ring formation, becomes position 3 of the ring. Similarly for 4 and 5.

So, the starting material's substituents are in 3,4,5 positions of the chain, which after ring formation becomes the same positions in the ring.

So, the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, so the chain is 8 carbons long. Double bonds at 1 and 7.

The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), 5 (i-Pr).

So, when the ring closes, the double bonds at 1 and 7 will form a new double bond in the ring, and the substituents in the middle (3,4,5) become part of the ring.

Wait, but how does the ring form? The catalyst would break the 1 and 7 double bonds and form a new double bond between positions that connect the ends.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the ends (positions 1 and 7) are connected via metathesis to form a ring. But in that case, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be part of the ring. So, the product would have substituents at 3,4,5, which is what we want.

So, the starting material is option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

So, I'm thinking option A is the correct starting material.

Wait, but why not option C? Option C has double bonds at 1 and 6. So, that would make the chain 8 carbons, so 1 and 6 would be positions 1 and 6. So, the distance between them is 5 carbons apart, which would form a 6-membered ring upon ring-closing.

Wait, yeah, because the number of carbons between the double bonds determines the ring size. So, the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus the two involved in the ring would be the ring size.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the starting material must have a diene where the two double bonds are spaced four carbons apart.

Wait, because 4 carbons (between 1 and 6 in an 8-carbon chain) would allow the two ends to connect, forming a six-membered ring (since 4 + 2 = 6).

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, that's an 8-carbon chain with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. Wait, no, wait. No, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So, the distance between the two double bonds is 4 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6? No, wait, positions 2 and 6 are separated by 3,4,5—so three carbons in between.

Wait, but the ring formed would depend on how many atoms are between the ends.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct spacing is such that the number of atoms between the two double bonds is four (for six-membered ring). Because, in ring-closing metathesis, the formula is often to have the two double bonds separated by a certain number of carbons to form the desired ring size.

So, for a six-membered ring, the two double bonds in the starting material should be separated by four carbons. So, for an octadiene, the double bonds would be at positions 1 and 6, because between position 1 and 6, there are four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). So, the starting material would be octa-1,6-diene.

So, that would make option C the correct starting material.

Wait, but in option C, the substituents are 5-isopropyl and 3,4-dimethyl. So, positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl.

If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, then when the ring forms, the substituents would be positioned correctly.

Wait, let's imagine the structure:

Positions 1-8: 1=CH2, 2=CH2, 3=CH(CH3), 4=CH(CH3), 5=CH(CH2CH(CH3)2), 6=CH2, 7=CH2, 8=CH2.

Wait, no, maybe the substituents are in 3,4,5.

So, upon ring-closing metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 6) would form a ring. The substituents from positions 3,4,5 would be part of the ring.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. So, if the starting material has substituents at 3,4,5, then they would be part of the ring. So, that makes sense.

Wait, but the starting material must have the substituents in such a way that when the ends are connected, their positions in the ring are correct.

So, perhaps the answer is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but earlier I thought the double bonds should be spaced so that the ring is six-membered, which would require the substituents to be four carbons apart.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think about the number of atoms involved in the ring. If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the two double bonds are at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The number of atoms between the double bonds is 4 (positions 3,4,5, and 6? No, positions 3,4,5,6: that's four positions, but the actual atoms are 3,4,5,6, which is four carbons. So, when the metathesis occurs, the two ends (from 1 and 6) would form a new double bond, and the ring would have six members (since you're connecting carbon 1 to carbon 6, which is five bonds away, making a six-membered ring).

Wait, let me think about the chain as:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2

But that's octa-1,7-diene, which is option A.

Wait, no, if it's octa-1,6-diene, it would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2

Wait, that's 8 carbons with double bonds at 1 and 6.

Wait, that would make the substituents in positions 3,4,5.

So, when the ring forms, the positions 1 and 6 would form the bridge, and the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the ring.

So, after ring-closing, the substituents would be at the correct positions.

Wait, but how exactly does the metathesis proceed? Let me think about the mechanism. The catalyst (Grubbs) would break the two double bonds and re-form them in a way that connects the ends.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes at the ends of the chain undergo a process where the catalyst opens the double bonds, swaps the ends, and forms a new double bond connecting the ends, forming the ring.

So, for the starting material to become cyclohexene, the chain must have the correct number of atoms so that when the ends are connected, the ring is six-membered.

If the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the distance between the two double bonds is four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). So, when the ends are connected (position 1 to position 6), the ring would have six members.

Wait, the catalyst would break the double bonds, reorganize, and form a new bond between carbons 1 and 6, which would create a six-membered ring.

So, the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Thus, the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but double-checking the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, so that's the correct starting material.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the product and the requirements for the reaction. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond between positions 1 and 2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ring-Closing Metathesis Mechanism**:  
   This reaction involves a starting material with two double bonds. The catalyst (e.g., Grubbs catalyst) facilitates the breaking and re-forming of double bonds, connecting the ends of the chain to form a ring. The size of the ring depends on the spacing between the double bonds in the starting material.

2. **Ring Size and Double Bond Spacing**:  
   For a six-membered ring, the double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four carbons. This ensures that the ends of the chain connect to form a six-membered ring.

3. **Substituent Positions**:  
   The substituents in the starting material must align such that, after the ring forms, they occupy the correct positions (3, 4, and 5) on the cyclohexene ring.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
  This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. The spacing between the double bonds is too large (six carbons apart), which would form a larger ring (e.g., seven-membered) rather than a six-membered ring. This is not suitable.

- **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
  This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The spacing between the double bonds is three carbons apart, which would form a five-membered ring. This does not match the required six-membered ring. Not suitable.

- **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
  This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. The spacing between the double bonds is four carbons apart, which is ideal for forming a six-membered ring. Additionally, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 align correctly to match the product structure. This is the correct starting material.

- **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
  This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, and the substituents are misplaced (isopropyl at position 4 and methyl groups at positions 5 and 6). This does not match the required substituent positions in the product. Not suitable.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate double bond spacing and substituent positions to form the desired six-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis.

Answer: C
