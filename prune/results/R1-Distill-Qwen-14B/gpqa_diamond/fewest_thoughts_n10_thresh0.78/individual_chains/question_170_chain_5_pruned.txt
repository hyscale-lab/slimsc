Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator for the observable. In this case, the observable is S_y, so I need the corresponding operator.

Wait, the problem provided the Pauli matrix σ_y, which is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

But S_y isn't exactly σ_y. Oh right, I think the spin operator S is related to the Pauli matrices by S = (ħ/2) σ. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times σ_y. That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 particles like electrons.

So, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the given σ_y matrix.

The state vector is given as (3i, 4). Let me note that down. So ψ = [3i, 4]^T. I think I should normalize this vector because the expectation value calculation might depend on that. Wait, but sometimes when people give a state, they might not normalize it, but I'm not sure if I need to here. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, meaning the inner product of ψ with itself should be 1. Let me check that.

Calculating the inner product: (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = (-9i²) + 16. Since i² is -1, this becomes 9 +16=25. Oh, so the norm is 25. So the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/5)[3i,4]^T. But wait, the expectation value formula doesn't necessarily require the state to be normalized because the expectation value would then need to be divided by the norm squared. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the expectation value formula ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ) / (ψ† ψ) when ψ is not normalized. Because ψ† ψ is the norm squared. So in this case, ψ is not normalized because its norm squared is 25, as we saw.

So the expectation value would be (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct myself. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ only if the state is not normalized. Wait, no, no. Wait, the standard formula is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but that's when the state is normalized. If the state isn't normalized, then the expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

So in this case, ψ is (3i,4), so ⟨ψ| is ( -3i, 4 ). Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

First, compute the denominator: ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + 4*4 = (-9i²) + 16. Again, i² is -1, so -9*(-1) is 9. 9+16=25. So the denominator is 25.

Now, the numerator is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

But S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so I can write S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, let's compute it step by step.

Let me denote ψ as a column vector: [3i; 4].

So, S_y ψ would be: 

First row: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i
Second row: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ| S_y ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by this vector.

⟨ψ| is [ -3i*, 4* ] which is [ 3, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. The conjugate transpose of ψ is [ -3i^*, 4^* ].

Since ψ is [3i, 4]^T, its conjugate is [ -3i, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i. So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i*, 4* ] which becomes [-3*(-i), 4] → [3i, 4]. Wait, no. Wait, the original ψ is [3i;4], so to get ⟨ψ|, which is the conjugate transpose
