Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing some strong and weak acids and a strong base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when dealing with a mixture of acids and bases, the first thing to do is determine the excess of acid or base after they've neutralized each other. So, I'll need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution, sum them up, and see what's left.

Wait, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 times the concentration times the volume. Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely, giving H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, in solution, it does donate some H+ ions through dissociation. Oh, but when mixed with other acids or bases, the strong ones will dominate. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate all the H+ and OH- contributions.

Wait, but wait. Let me structure this:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each solution.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from each solution.
3. Subtract OH- from H+ to find the net H+ or OH-.
4. Depending on which is in excess, determine the concentration and then the pH.

Wait, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will contribute H+ ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it contributes H+ too, but not as much as the strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it contributes OH- ions.

But wait, when you mix an acid and a base, they can neutralize each other. So, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a base and HCl is an acid. So, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, any remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH.

So, let's calculate each part.

First, the volume and molarity of each solution:

- CH3COOH: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it will contribute some H+.

- HCl: 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, giving 0.08 moles of H+.

- Ba(OH)2: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait, let's check that. Wait, molarity is moles per liter. So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives two OH- ions, so 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, the total moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH: HCl contributes 0.08, CH3COOH contributes let's say x.

Wait, but wait, I think I need to calculate the H+ from each acid.

HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid. Its dissociation is: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8e-5. Since the solution is a weak acid, I can approximate the [H+] using the formula sqrt(Ka * C), but wait, that's only if the dissociation is small, which it is for weak acids.

But wait, but when we mix all these solutions together, the concentration of CH3COOH will change. The total volume will be 500+400+300 = 1200 mL or 1.2 L.

So, after mixing, the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

The H+ from CH3COOH would be sqrt(Ka * C). So, sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.0417) ≈ sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 8.68e-4 M. Wait, no, that's the [H+], but wait, that's per liter. But wait, the actual amount of H+ moles from acetic acid would be [H+] * total volume.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to calculate the moles of H+ from each source.

Wait, HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, contributes some H+. Let me think about how to calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, so all 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl will be available. Then, the acetic acid will contribute some H+.

So, the total H+ would be HCl's H+ plus the H+ from CH3COOH.

But wait, when you mix the solutions, all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will be present, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with them.

So, let's calculate the total H+ and OH-.

H+ sources:

- HCl: 0.08 mol
- CH3COOH: Let's calculate using the equation.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it dissociates as:

CH3COOH → H+ + CH3COO^-.

But since the dissociation is small, the [H+] from CH3COOH can be approximated as sqrt(Ka * C), where C is the concentration after mixing.

After mixing, the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Ka = 1.8e-5.

So, [H+] from CH3COOH ≈ sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.0417) = sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 8.68e-4 M.

Therefore, the moles of H+ from CH3COOH = 8.68e-4 M * 1.2 L ≈ 0.0010416 mol.

So, total H+ from acids is 0.08 + 0.0010416 ≈ 0.08104 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

Now, the OH- will react with H+ in a 1:1 ratio.

So, moles of H+ after neutralization: 0.08104 - 0.18 = negative? That can't be. Wait, 0.08104 is less than 0.18, so all H+ will be neutralized, and excess OH- will remain.

So, the excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08104 = 0.09896 moles.

Wait, that's 0.09896 moles of OH- in 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.09896 / 1.2 ≈ 0.08247 M.

Then, the pOH is log(1/[OH-])? Wait, no, pOH = -log[OH-].

So, [OH-] = 0.08247 M.

pOH = -log(0.08247) ≈ 1.08.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 12.92.

Wait, but none of the options are 12.92. The options are A)12.62, B)1.38, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of H+ from CH3COOH. Because I treated it as a weak acid, but when mixed with a strong base, perhaps the H+ is negligible compared to the H+ from HCl. But wait, wait, the HCl is 0.08 moles, and the OH- is 0.18 moles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the H+ from CH3COOH more accurately.

Wait, another approach: When you mix all the solutions, the total H+ comes from HCl, CH3COOH, and any H+ from water, but water's contribution is negligible here.

So, H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: Let me recalculate that.

The concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

Ka = 1.8e-5.

The dissociation equation is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. At equilibrium:

[H+] = x
[CH3COOH] = 0.04167 - x ≈ 0.04167 (since x is small)
So, Ka = x^2 / 0.04167 = 1.8e-5
x^2 = 1.8e-5 * 0.04167 ≈ 7.5e-7
x ≈ sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 8.68e-4 M.

So, the moles of H+ from CH3COOH would be 8.68e-4 M * 1.2 L = 0.0010416 mol.

So, total H+ from both acids = 0.08 + 0.0010416 ≈ 0.08104.

Then, OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, OH- will react with H+:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.08104 mol H+ reacts with 0.08104 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08104 ≈ 0.09896 mol OH-.

Total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] = 0.09896 / 1.2 ≈ 0.082467 M.

pOH = -log(0.082467) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

But none of the options are 12.92. The closest option is A)12.62. So, where did I go wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reaction more accurately. Wait, wait, is there any reaction between CH3COOH and OH-?

Because when you have a weak acid and a strong base, they can react. So, perhaps the OH- can neutralize the CH3COOH as well.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 can react not only with H+ from HCl but also with CH3COOH.

Wait, let me think again. The OH- will react with both H+ from HCl and any available H+ from CH3COOH. So, the sequence is:

1. OH- reacts with all the H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) first. So, that neutralizes 0.08 mol OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, this remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it can donate H+ (but not as much as a strong acid). So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Each mole of CH3COOH consumes one mole of OH-.

So, moles of CH3COOH available: 0.05 mol.

Moles of OH- after neutralizing HCl: 0.10 mol.

So, 0.05 mol of CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol of OH-.

So, remaining OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, after all reactions, we have 0.05 mol of OH- left in 1.2 L.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Ah, that's option A)12.62.

So, the mistake earlier was not considering that the OH- would also react with the weak acid, CH3COOH, after neutralizing the strong acid HCl. I had initially only considered the H+ from CH3COOH and added it to the H+ from HCl, then subtracted all OH-. But actually, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl and then proceed to neutralize the weak acid, which can donate H+.

Wait, let me re-express this.

When you mix all three solutions, you have:

- H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.
- H+ from CH3COOH (weak): 0.0010416 mol.
- OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

But the OH- will react with H+ first. The H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH.

But wait, in reality, the H+ from CH3COOH is not a strong acid, so it can be neutralized by OH-.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

Total H+ available = HCl H+ + CH3COOH H+ = 0.08 + 0.0010416 ≈ 0.08104 mol.

Total OH- = 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- can neutralize 0.08104 mol of H+, leaving 0.18 - 0.08104 = 0.09896 mol OH-.

Then, [OH-] = 0.09896 / 1.2 ≈ 0.082467 M. pOH is 1.08, pH 12.92.

Wait, but that's different. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because when you have a strong acid and a weak acid, the OH- can neutralize the strong acid's H+ first, and any remaining OH- can neutralize the weak acid's H+.

Wait, no, the OH- doesn't "know" which H+ comes from where. It just reacts with any available H+.

Wait, but in solution, the H+ from HCl is more available because it's a strong acid. The OH- will neutralize all available H+ regardless of source.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

Total H+ available = HCl H+ + CH3COOH H+.

But the CH3COOH H+ is actually in the solution, so when OH- is added, it will react with all H+.

But in reality, the H+ from CH3COOH is present, so the OH- will react with both.

Wait, but the initial calculation where I accounted for the OH- neutralizing the HCl H+ and then the remaining OH- neutralizing the CH3COOH H+ would be the correct approach.

Wait, no, because when you mix them, the solution has all the H+ available at once. So, the OH- will react with all H+ present, regardless of their source.

So, in the first scenario, the total H+ is 0.08104, which is less than the OH- 0.18. So, all H+ is neutralized, and excess OH- is 0.09896, giving pH ~12.92.

But in the second approach, where I considered the OH- neutralizing HCl first, then the weak acid, I ended up with 0.05 mol OH- left, which gives pH ~12.62.

Wait, but which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the second approach is correct because the OH- can react with the weak acid as well. So, the OH- will neutralize the strong acid first, but since the H+ from the weak acid is present, the OH- can also neutralize that.

Wait, but in reality, the H+ from the weak acid is already in solution, so the OH- will react with it as well. So, the first approach where OH- neutralizes all H+ (from both acids) is correct.

But then why is the answer 12.62 in one approach and 12.92 in the other?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the H+ from CH3COOH. Because when the solution is neutralized, the concentration of CH3COOH changes, which affects the dissociation.

Wait, when you mix all three solutions, the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol/1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. The H+ from CH3COOH is about 8.68e-4 M, which gives 0.0010416 mol H+.

So, the OH- would neutralize all 0.08104 mol H+, leaving 0.09896 mol OH-.

So, [OH-] = 0.09896 / 1.2 = 0.082467 M.

pOH = -log(0.082467) ≈ 1.08 → pH ≈ 12.92.

But that's not one of the options. The options have A)12.62 and others.

Hmm, what's the right approach here?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the OH- will react with the weak acid as well, so the initial approach where I neutralized HCl first, then the OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

So, HCl's H+ is 0.08, which reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, this 0.10 mol OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 mol. So, all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- remains.

Then, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

This approach makes sense because the OH- can neutralize both the strong acid and the weak acid. So, the initial H+ from HCl is neutralized, and the remaining OH- neutralizes the weak acid (CH3COOH), which acts as an acid in the presence of OH-.

Wait, another way to think about it: the OH- will react with any available H+ in the solution. So, the H+ from HCl is stronger and more available, so OH- neutralizes that first, and then the remaining OH- can neutralize the CH3COOH.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so not all of its H+ is dissociated. So, the OH- can only neutralize the H+ that's already in solution plus any that can be dissociated.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to model it as a neutralization reaction between the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2), and then see if any of the weak acid (CH3COOH) is left to react with the remaining OH-.

So, let's calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Moles H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, when H+ and OH- are mixed, they react in a 1:1 ratio.

So, the H+ from HCl (0.08) and OH- (0.18) will neutralize:

OH- consumes H+ from HCl, so remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, the CH3COOH is present in 0.05 mol, which can donate H+. The OH- can react with CH3COOH:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

This reaction will proceed until one of the reagents is used up.

So, we have 0.10 mol OH- and 0.05 mol CH3COOH.

So, CH3COOH will be completely neutralized, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, that brings us to option A, 12.62.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions:

### Given Data:
1. **CH₃COOH (weak acid)**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.1 M  
   - Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - After mixing, concentration = \( \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M} \).  
   - Using \( \text{Ka} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), the H⁺ from CH₃COOH is calculated as:  
     \[
     [\text{H}^+] = \sqrt{\text{Ka} \cdot C} = \sqrt{(1.8 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.0417} \approx 8.68 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}.
     \]  
     Moles of H⁺ from CH₃COOH = \( 8.68 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 1.2 \approx 0.00104 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **HCl (strong acid)**:  
   - Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \times 0.4 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base)**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \cdot 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Neutralization Reaction:
1. **Reaction Sequence**:  
   - OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl first (strong acid), neutralizing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.  
   - Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).  

2. **Reaction with CH₃COOH**:  
   - The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH (weak acid).  
   - CH₃COOH is completely neutralized (\( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \)), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

### Final OH⁻ Concentration:
- Total volume = \( 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- \[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
\]

### pH Calculation:
1. \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
2. \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

### Conclusion:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, corresponding to **Option A**.

Answer: A
