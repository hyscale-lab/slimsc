Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl group, probably a C=O. So the compound likely has both an O-H and a C=O. Carboxylic acids have both of these, right? The C=O in carboxylic acids is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the O-H is broad because of hydrogen bonding. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the possible structures, all options have a COOH group except maybe? No, all options end with COOH. So that's good.

Now the NMR part. The user says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl would be like CH₂=CH, so no double bonds. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense because all the options have single bonds except maybe if there's a double bond elsewhere, but looking at the options, I don't see any double bonds.

The NMR shows some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a certain number of peaks. The more neighbors, the more splitting.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.
Wait, let me write this structure. The main chain is probably something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's more like:

The molecule is CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-CH2-COOH.

So each of the two middle carbons (the ones attached to CH3 and C2H5) has two substituents: a CH3 and a C2H5 group, and two Hs? Or wait, perhaps each of those carbons has a CH and two substituents. Let me draw it:

CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, actually, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the two central carbons each have a CH group (with one H) and two substituents: each is attached to a C2H5 group and a CH3 group? Wait, no. Looking at the formula: the first part is CH3C(H)(C2H5), which would be CH3-C(H)(C2H5
