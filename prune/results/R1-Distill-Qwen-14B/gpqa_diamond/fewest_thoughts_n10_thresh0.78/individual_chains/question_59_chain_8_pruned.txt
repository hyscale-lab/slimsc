Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Then there's 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, a strong acid, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, a strong base. So, it's a mix of an acid and a base, but one is weak and the others are strong. Hmm, I think I need to consider if they neutralize each other or not.

Wait, right, when you mix acids and bases, the H+ ions and OH- ions will react. But since some are strong, they'll dissociate completely, while others might not. Let me break it down.

Let me calculate the moles of each component first. Moles are calculated by Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters). 

Starting with CH3COOH: Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of acetic acid. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. So the H+ from this won't be as much as a strong acid, but for now, maybe I should just note that we'll have some H+ from it later.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions. So moles of OH^- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when you mix all these solutions together, the total volume will be the sum of all the individual volumes. 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

But before that, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So I'll calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

From HCl: 0.08 moles H+.
From Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles OH-.

So, which is more? OH- is more. So all the H+ will react with some OH-, and the remaining OH- will determine the pH.

Let me subtract the moles:

Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

So, after neutralization, I have 0.10 moles of OH- in the solution. Also, what about the acetic acid? Since acetic acid is a weak acid, but the OH- is in excess, it might react with it as well.

Wait, right. The OH- can also react with the acetic acid. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, which can donate a proton. So the OH- would deprotonate it.

So, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, let me think again. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The H+ from
