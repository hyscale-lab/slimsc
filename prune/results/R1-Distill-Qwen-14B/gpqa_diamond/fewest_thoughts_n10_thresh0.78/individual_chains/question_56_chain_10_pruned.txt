Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I remember that hydrogen atom states are described by quantum numbers n, l, m. The question is about a state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to find the correct transition route and the probability.

Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right! The selection rules for hydrogen. For a dipole transition, the change in quantum numbers is governed by certain rules. I think Δl is ±1, and Δm is 0, ±1. Also, Δn can be any, but in multi-step transitions, like this two-step decay, each step must follow the selection rules.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays in two steps, each step being a dipole transition. So first, from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the final transition must end at l=0. Let's think about the possible first transitions.

In the first transition, since l starts at 0, the next l must be ±1. So l can go to 1. Because you can't go to l=-1, since l is non-negative. So the first transition is from l=0 to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |something, 1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, the second transition must take this state to |1,0,0>. So, from l=1 to l=0. Let's see what's possible. For the second transition, the selection rules apply again. So in the second step, l must change by ±1, so 1 → 0 is allowed.

But wait, the m quantum number must also change by 0 or ±1 each step.

So let's track the possible m values. The initial state is m=0. So first transition, m can change by 0, +1, or -1. Let's say the first transition goes to m=1, then in the second transition, m can change again, but must end up at 0.

Hmm, let's think step by step.

First transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>, then |2,1, m1> → |1,0,0>.

Each step must obey Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

So for first step, l goes from 0 → 1 (Δl=+1), so that's allowed. n must decrease by 1 in each step? Wait, no, n can change by any, but in the two steps, the total n change is from 3→1, so each step could change by -1, or maybe not. Let me check. For the first transition, n can go from 3→2 or 3→1? Wait, no, because in a dipole transition, in a single step, you can have Δn = ±1. Because for a dipole transition, the change in principal quantum number is usually limited by Δn = ±1. Or wait, I think for dipole transitions, Δn can be any except 0, but in practice, the allowed transitions are where Δn is ±1. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. The selection rule for n in hydrogen is more about the change in energy levels, but for dipole transitions, the main selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The change in n is not strictly restricted, but the transition probability is higher for certain Δn. For example, from n=3 to n=2, that's a Δn=-1. Then from n=2 to n=1, another Δn=-1.

So in this case, the two-step decay would involve n=3 → n=2 → n=1.

So first, the state |3,0,0> transitions to a state with n=2, l=1, m=...? The possible m values are -1, 0, +1.

Then, from n=2, l=1, m= m1 to |1,0,0>.

So in the second step, n goes from 2→1, Δn=-1. l goes from 1→0, which is Δl=-1, so that's allowed.

Now, for the m quantum number, the first transition can change m by 0, ±1.

So first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1, m1>, where m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Then, second transition: |2,1, m1> → |1,0, 0>.

So for the second step, the m must change from m1 to 0. So Δm can be 0, ±1.

So, what m1 values allow that?

Case 1: m1=1 → second transition must have Δm= -1 → m=0. So 1 →0 is a Δm=-1. That's allowed.

Case 2: m1=0 → Δm=0 in second step. So m stays 0. Then, |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>. That's allowed.

Case 3: m1=-1 → second transition needs Δm= +1 → m=-1 → 0. That's allowed.

So, all three m1 possibilities are valid. But wait, in the options, the first step goes from 3,0,0 to 2,1,0; or to 2,1,1; or 2,1,-1. Then the second step goes to 1,0,0.

But the options don't show all possible m1; they have specific options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>, probability 1/4.

Option C: →
