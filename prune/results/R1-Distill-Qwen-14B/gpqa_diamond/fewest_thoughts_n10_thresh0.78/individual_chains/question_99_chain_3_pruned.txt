Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data given. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR data. The question mentions a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, the presence of a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have both an O-H stretch and a carbonyl. Since the broad peak is very broad, that's more characteristic of a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch, which is usually broader than an alcohol's. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700, so that fits. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. None of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, meaning there are no double bonds or alkenes in the structure. So all the hydrogens are in single bonds, which matches with the IR data since alkenes have different IR absorptions, but that's not an issue here.

The NMR has several peaks. One of them is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting in NMR is due to neighboring protons. Each time a proton has neighboring Hs, it splits into a multiplet.

A quartet means each proton is next to a group with three equivalent protons (n+1 =4 → n=3). A triplet would come from two neighboring Hs, so n=2. Similarly, a doublet is from one neighboring set.

So let's unpack the first signal: doublet of triplets of quartets. Breaking it down, each split comes from neighboring Hs. So perhaps the proton is next to a CH2 group (quartet), which is then split by another group, maybe a CH or so.

Wait, each split is a subsequent neighbor. So the quartet could be from one set, then triplet from another, then doublet from another. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of multiple coupling partners. Maybe the proton is adjacent to multiple different groups with different numbers of Hs.

Alternatively, another approach: the splitting pattern can indicate the structure around the proton. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
That structure has CH(CH2CH3) groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the structure is more like CH2CH3 attached to a central carbon, then another CH(C2H5), and then COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
This has two CH(CH3) groups attached. So the central part is two CH(CH3) groups.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
This has CH2CH3 groups and CH(CH3), attached to COOH.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any vinyl Hs, so all structures are without double bonds, which they all are.

So, let's think about the NMR signals. The COOH group is a carboxylic acid. In the 1H NMR, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but sometimes it can exchange and appear as a singlet or be missing if it's exchanging and not showing up. Alternatively, if it's deuterated, but the question says "several peaks," so maybe the COOH proton is
