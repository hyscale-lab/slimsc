Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The problem has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I think t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something. Wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester with an alpha, beta-unsaturated group. Oh right! This sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction or a Michael addition. Wait, wait, the starting material is a ketone. So, maybe it's a cycloaddition. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one has a ketone at position 1. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl), and another methyl at position 2, I think. Wait, wait, wait: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ring has three substituents: an ethyl group at C2, a methyl at C2 and C6. Wait, no, wait: wait, wait. The numbering is 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. So at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? No, wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So, let's see: the cyclohexanone is at position 1. So, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached? Because 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at 2 and 6, and then 2-ethyl adds another substituent at 2. So position 2 has ethyl and methyl groups. So that's a lot of substituents on C2.

Now, when a cyclohexanone reacts with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) under basic conditions
