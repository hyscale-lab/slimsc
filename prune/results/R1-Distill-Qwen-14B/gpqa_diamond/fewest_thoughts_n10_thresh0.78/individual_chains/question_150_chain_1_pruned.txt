Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I should calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which gives 4) and a double bond (1), or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it could be an acidic proton, maybe a phenol? But phenol protons are around 5-7 ppm, so probably not. So maybe an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That seems like aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split each other into doublets.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. If the first set is para, then this could be another para substitution, but maybe on another ring. Wait, but how many rings? The molecular formula suggests maybe two benzene rings, but wait, C8H9NO. Wait, benzene rings have 6 carbons each, so two rings would be 12 carbons, but we have only 8. Hmm, maybe it's a single benzene ring and another group.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets for aromatic protons. Let me think. Maybe the molecule has a substituent on the benzene that causes splitting. For example, a para-substituted benzene with another substituent? Or maybe a di-substituted benzene?

Wait, but let's look at the rest. 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. That's another set of protons. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but that's usually a singlet but at lower ppm. Or maybe it's a conjugated system, like an enol or something. Or possibly vinyl protons adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's probably a CH2 group, possibly next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an -OCH2- group, or adjacent to a carbonyl. Or maybe part of an ethyl group attached to something.

Putting this together: Maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think about the aldehyde. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is a bit unusual for an aldehyde proton, which is usually a singlet. Unless it's coupled to another proton. For example, if it's attached to a CH2 group adjacent, the aldehyde proton could be a triplet. Wait, because a triplet would mean two neighboring protons. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO? But then the coupling for the aldehyde proton would come from the CH2 group. Let me see: the aldehyde's H is next to a CH2, so the CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling to the aldehyde H, making it a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is at the end of a chain that has another proton. Like R-CH2-CHO. But that would be a triplet for the aldehyde H.

Wait, another thought: maybe the structure involves a conjugated system. Like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but wait, but the double bond is at 3-enal, so Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? Wait, but but-3-enal would be CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So diphenyl would have phenyl groups on carbons 2 and 4. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, but-3-enal is CH2-CH2-CHO but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, but but-3-enal would be CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, numbering the chain as 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So, but-3-enal is an aldehyde with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So positions are 1 (CHO), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH), 4 (CH2?), no, wait maybe:

But-3-enal is CH2CH2CHO with the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The IUPAC name for but-3-enal would be: the aldehyde is at position 1, then a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-enal would be CHO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that can't be because then it's only three carbons from the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps but-3-enal is actually CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Hmm, that would make sense. So the aldehyde is at the end, the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. So for 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal, that would have phenyl groups on C2 and C4. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO but with a double bond between C3 and C4? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but maybe
