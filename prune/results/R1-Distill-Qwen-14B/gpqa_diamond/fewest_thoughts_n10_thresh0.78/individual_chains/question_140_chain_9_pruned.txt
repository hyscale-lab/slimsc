Okay, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is around 4 degrees Celsius. Oh, wait, water freezes at 273 K (0Â°C), so 277 K is a bit above that. Hmm, maybe B is ice? But that doesn't make sense because ice melts at 273 K, not higher. Unless B is something else. Wait, maybe it's another substance with a similar melting point. Alternatively, maybe B is something else like a solid that's just starting to melt around that temperature.

Moving on, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product contains two oxygen atoms. Also, substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Its analog is also a reagent. So, X is probably a common reagent. I'm thinking of something like KMnO4 or maybe something else. Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a halogen, because halogens are used in various reactions. Oh wait, like when you have reactions with HCl or something else.

Wait, the reaction produces a precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. So, perhaps G is some kind of carbonate which, upon heating, decomposes into B. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and CaO. But wait, B in that case would be CO2, but CO2 isn't a solid. Hmm, maybe B is a metal oxide or something else.

Wait, another angle: The gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O: each molecule has 1 proton (since H has 1 each, but O has 8. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, gas W's molecule must have equal number of neutrons and protons in total. So, let's see.

Possible gases: O2 is O2, each O atom has 8 protons. So O2 has 16 protons total. The neutrons in O: O has atomic number 8, atomic mass around 16, so it's O-16. Each O has 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, O2 is a possible candidate for W. Alternatively, other possibilities: NH3? No, it's a liquid under certain conditions. CO2? Each CO2 molecule has 2 O (16 each) and 1 C (
