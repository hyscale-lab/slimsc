Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D)28.

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma is large enough that beta is approximately 1. So beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1-betaÂ²).

Wait, but how does this relate to them reaching the detector's walls? Oh right, if the particles decay, their decay products can only reach the detector if the particles themselves don't decay before their path length is covered. The time they take to travel to the wall must be less than their proper lifetime. Or maybe it's about the mean lifetime as observed in the lab frame versus the particle's rest frame.

I think I should model this. Let me think. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance to the wall is the radius R, which is 30 meters.

The lifetime of the particle in its rest frame is tau. But due to time dilation, the lab frame observes a longer lifetime, gamma * tau.

The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = R / (v), which is the same as t = R/(beta c). Because v = beta c.

For the particle to reach the detector walls, the lifetime in the lab frame must be at least t. So gamma * tau >= t. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the likelihood of decay. The probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is related to the ratio of t to tau. But wait, no, the probability that it doesn't decay (so it does reach the wall) is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, that's for radioactive decay. The decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). But in this problem, the problem says that on average, one third reach the walls. So the probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = e^(- t / (gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability that a particle doesn't decay (i.e., reaches the wall) is e^(-t/(gamma tau)). Because t is the time in the lab frame. So if the proper lifetime is tau, the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The decay follows an exponential probability.

So, in the initial case, when gamma is 20, one third (1/3) of the particles reach the wall. So e^(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way around. Let me double-check. The decay probability is P = 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So
