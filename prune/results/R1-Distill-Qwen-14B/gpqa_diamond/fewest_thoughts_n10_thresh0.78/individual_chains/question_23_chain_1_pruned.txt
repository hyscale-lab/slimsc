Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question involves a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). The reaction was monitored using TLC, and two new spots appeared along with the diminishing of the reactant spot. I need to figure out which of the given options is correct.

Hmm, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw its structure to visualize it better. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group. So the structure is CH2CH2C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C3 and C4, right? So the structure is (CH2)2-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-Ph? Or wait, no. Let me correct that. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, no, the numbering for the butenyl group is 1, 2, 3, 4. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4? But that would make it impossible because but has only 4 carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2-CH2 but double bond is between C3 and C4? Oh wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain where the double bond starts at the third carbon. So the structure is CH2
