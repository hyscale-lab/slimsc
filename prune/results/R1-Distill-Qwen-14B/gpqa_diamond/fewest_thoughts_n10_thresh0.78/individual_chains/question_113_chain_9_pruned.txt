Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Alright, let's break down the information provided. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl group, but that usually has a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹, which I do see here. Oh, wait, the FTIR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So what functional groups have those?

The 1700 peak is likely a carbonyl (C=O), which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the typical carbonyl, so maybe it's another group. Could that be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or an amide? Or maybe it's a conjugated ketone.

Wait, but the 1650 cm⁻¹ is in the range for an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a conjugated diene nearby. Alternatively, that could be an amide (amide I band is around 1650), but that's probably less likely unless the molecule has an amide group, which isn't suggested by the options.

Then there's the 1H NMR part. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group. So from the NMR, I could infer that there's a double bond present.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think. What's m
