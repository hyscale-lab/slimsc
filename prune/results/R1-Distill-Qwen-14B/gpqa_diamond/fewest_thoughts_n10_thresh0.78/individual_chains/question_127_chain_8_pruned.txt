Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I remember that heating can cause various reactions, like elimination or maybe some rearrangements. Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me draw its structure to visualize it better.

So nona-2,6-diene means the main chain has nine carbons with double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The substituent is a butyl group at position 5. But wait, butyl is four carbons. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count the carbons. The main chain is nine carbons, so numbering from 1 to 9. The double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, wait. The double bonds are at 2 and 6. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
