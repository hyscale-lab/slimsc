Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again carefully to understand all the parts.

So the question involves a mixture X that consists of two liquids in equimolar amounts. This mixture decolorizes bromine water, which usually means it has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine to decolorize the solution. 

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) catalyst under heating, it undergoes a reaction, resulting in another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, so if X could decolorize bromine, but Y can't, that suggests that X had something that could add bromine, but Y doesn't. Wait, but the reaction is with Pt and heat—could that be a hydrogenation reaction?

Wait, the next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 

So, mass fraction of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100%. For hydrocarbon Z, which is a hydrocarbon, so it's CnH2m. Let's find the molecular formula. 

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. Let me see. Let's assume Z is CnH2m. The molar mass is 12n + 2m. The mass of H is 2m g per mole. So, (2m)/(12n + 2m) ) *100 =14.28.

Let me compute that:

(2m) / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = 0.1428*(12n + 2m)
2m = 1.7136n + 0.2856m
2m - 0.2856m = 1.7136n
1.7144m = 1.7136n

Hmm, approximately, 1.7144m≈1.7136n. So, m ≈n. Maybe m =n? Let me check: 2m/(12n +2m) = 2n/(12n +2n) )= 2n/(14n) )= 1/7 ≈0.1428. Yes! So, the formula is CnH2n. That means Z is an alkane, but wait, no. Wait, wait! Wait, that would be for an alkene or alkyne. Wait, no, wait: if it's CnH2n, that's like an alkene, but wait, but Z is the product of hydrogenation. Oh, wait, because X and Y are hydrogenated to Z. So if Z is CnH2n, that would be more like an alkane, because alkenes would hydrogenate to alkanes. Wait, but wait, no, because alkenes have CnH2n, alkanes have CnH2n+2. Oh wait, wait I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let me call the formula of Z as CnHm. So, the mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) *100 =14.28. 

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Cross multiplying:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)
m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m
m - 0.1428m = 1.7136n
