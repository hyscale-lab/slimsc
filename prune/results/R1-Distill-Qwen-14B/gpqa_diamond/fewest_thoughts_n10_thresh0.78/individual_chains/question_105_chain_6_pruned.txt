Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and think about what it's asking.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K. They mention that because the star is only spotted on one hemisphere, when they observe it, the brightness changes as the star rotates. This is similar to what we'd see if there was an exoplanet transiting the star.

The question is, to get the same brightness variation (the same amplitude in the light curve), what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet compared to the star's radius?

The options given are A to D, with various fractions.

Hmm, so I know that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of light blocked depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the change in brightness (the dip) is roughly (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star.

But in this case, the star isn't being blocked by a planet. Instead, part of its surface is cooler and darker, so when that part faces us, the star appears dimmer. So the observed brightness variation is due to spots rotating into and out of view.

So first, I need to figure out what the amplitude of this brightness variation is, and then see what planet radius would produce the same dip.

Let me think about the star's brightness contribution. The total luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But since the star has spots, part of its surface is at a lower temperature.

The filling factor is given as 20%, so 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the effective temperature of the star from our perspective depends on how much of it is at Teff and how much is at T_spot.

Wait, but the star's effective temperature is given as 6000 K. That's the overall Teff, considering the spots.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read again. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are cooler, at 5000 K.

So the star emits as if it's at 6000 K globally, but 20% of its surface area is at 5000 K, and the rest is at 6000 K? Or is the star's overall Teff 6000 K because of the spots? Hmm, perhaps I need to compute the star's total emission when part of it is cooler.

Wait no, the star's Teff is given as 6000 K, which is the effective temperature. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K, so they are 5000 K. So the star's overall emission is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions.

But for the purpose of calculating the brightness variation, what changes is the fraction of the star's surface that is cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is lower than when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, the star is rotating, so as the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the observed flux decreases. But the other hemisphere is not spotty, so when it's facing us, the flux is higher because 100% of that hemisphere is at 6000 K.

Wait, no, the description says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere (northern and southern, perhaps) has 20% spot coverage. Or maybe the entire star's surface has 20% coverage, but because it's only on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux.

Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so when that hemisphere is visible, 20% of that
