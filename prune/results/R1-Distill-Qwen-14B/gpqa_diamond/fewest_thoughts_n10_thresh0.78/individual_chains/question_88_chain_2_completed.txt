Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think through it.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they looked at the fluorescent Peyer patches, isolated the proliferating cells, and sequenced their variable heavy chain genes. The result was high variability. The question is about which process is happening.

Hmm. Okay, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for handling antigens in the gut. So when they see fluorescence in Peyer patches, that suggests the rotavirus proteins (tagged with GFP) have been taken up by these patches.

The fact that some GFP was destroyed by stomach acid might mean that not all the proteins made it through. Stomach acid is harsh—so maybe some proteins denatured, but others survived. Then, the ones that reached the intestines might have been bound by mucus, which is黏性的, so maybe they didn't get into the Peyer patches right away.

But the main part is that after isolating proliferating cells from these patches, they saw high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in the variable regions—what process does that?

I remember that during the immune response, B cells undergo several processes. One is V(D)J recombination, which happens during the formation of B cells in the bone marrow. VDJ is about generating diversity in the antigen receptors (like the B cell receptor) by recombining variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments. But VDJ would have already happened when the B cells were developing, so I'm not sure if this is about VDJ happening again.

Wait, but after the initial B cell development, during the immune response, there's another process called somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions. This increases diversity among the B cell receptors, allowing for a more specific response. So when they sequence and find high variability, that suggests that each cell has slightly different variable regions, which is exactly what you'd see with somatic hypermutation.

Alternatively, class switching recombination is about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't directly affect the variable regions' diversity. It's about the constant region. So that might not be it.

Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, but I don't think that's related to the gene variability here.

So, the process that leads to high variability in the variable heavy chain after an immune response is likely somatic hypermutation. So the answer would be A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence was observed in Peyer patches, and proliferating cells were isolated and sequenced for their variable heavy chain genes, showing high variability. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for handling antigens in the gut. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that increases diversity in the antigen receptor repertoire.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions to increase the diversity and specificity of their antigen receptors. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Other processes, such as V(D)J recombination, occur during early B cell development and would not explain the variability observed after antigen exposure. Class switching recombination involves changing the antibody isotype and does not affect the variable regions directly. Complement activation is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Thus, the process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
