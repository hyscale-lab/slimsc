Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in a three-dimensional isotropic potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Hmm, that's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because I remember that a harmonic oscillator potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r². So this is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But since it's isotropic, the potential doesn't depend on the direction, just the radial distance. So the energy levels are given in terms of the principal quantum number, or maybe the sum of the quantum numbers.

Oh right, in three dimensions, each state is characterized by three quantum numbers: nx, ny, nz. But because the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers. The energy levels are E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n = nx + ny + nz. Or wait, I think n is actually 2n_r + l + something... No, wait, no, that's for hydrogen-like atoms. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Let me think. The energy levels are E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh wait, actually I think it's E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers. So each state is determined by these three quantum numbers. The number of states with the same sum (n = n_x + n_y + n_z) gives the degeneracy.

So the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then E = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when the sum n is 1, which could be any one of the three directions. So the energy increases in steps, and each step corresponds to adding 1 to the sum.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Hmm, sometimes the counting can be a bit confusing. Ground state is the lowest energy, then first excited, second excited, etc. So the ground state is the zeroth excited state.

So the third excited state would have energy E = (3/2 + 3) ħω? Because each excited state adds 1 to the sum. Wait, no, because each step is an increment of 1 in n. Wait, let me think again.

The energy levels are: for n = 0,1,2,..., the energy is (n + 3/2) ħω. So for n=0, E=3/2 ħω (ground state), n=1, E=5/2 ħω (first excited), n=2
