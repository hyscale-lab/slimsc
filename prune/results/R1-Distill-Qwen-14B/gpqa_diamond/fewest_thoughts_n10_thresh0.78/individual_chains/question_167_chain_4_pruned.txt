Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

First, the state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N, where N is the normalization constant. Phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The question asks for the non-Gaussianity, measured by the relative entropy. The formula provided is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, so the non-Gaussianity is the difference in the entropy between the state and a Gaussian reference state. If the state is Gaussian, del_b would be zero. But since it's a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, del_b should be positive.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Let me think about the steps needed. I need to find the density matrix rho for |psi> and then compare it to a Gaussian state's density matrix tau. But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? I'm not entirely sure, but I think for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference is usually the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian one. Alternatively, sometimes it's the thermal state or something else. Oh wait, maybe for cat states, the reference Gaussian state is the squeezed vacuum or something similar. Hmm, but perhaps the calculation is simpler if I treat tau as the best Gaussian approximation of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is a coherent state? Or maybe the reference is the maximum entropy Gaussian state. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the structure of the state.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian, especially when they are coherent and have a high overlap, leading to a cat state.

So, the density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. Let's compute that. But wait, maybe I don't need to compute it explicitly. Instead, perhaps the relative entropy can be
