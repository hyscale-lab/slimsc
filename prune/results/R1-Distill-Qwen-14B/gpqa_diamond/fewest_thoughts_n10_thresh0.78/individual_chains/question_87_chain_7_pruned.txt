Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like benzene with two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8, which includes the benzene ring (which has 6 carbons, since benzene is C6H6). So the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, but waitâ€”each substituent might have more than one carbon. Oh, no, because 6 (from benzene) + 2 substituents (each with one carbon) would make 8. Or maybe one substituent has 2 carbons and the other has 0? Not sure. Wait, no, a substituent can't have zero carbons unless it's like a hydrogen or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. No, the substituents add up to 2 carbons in total. So, each substituent might have 1 carbon each. But wait, the substituents could also be more than one carbon each if there are other groups. Wait, wait. Let me count. The aromatic ring is benzene (6 carbons), and substituents: two substituents, each being, say, a methyl group (1 carbon each) would add to 6+2=8. But wait, if substituents are more complex, perhaps a carbonyl group and a halogen? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group is something like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc., which has a C=O. So, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). So, the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are attached to the ring. So, each substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring. So, for example, one substituent could be a carbonyl group like a ketone (like a benzophenone derivative), but then where would the other substituent be? Oh, wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen (like Cl). But then, let's count the carbons.

Wait, the benzene has 6 carbons. Each substituent is attached to it. So, the substituents could be, for example, a carbonyl group (which would add a carbon, as in a ketone group: R-CO- attached to the ring. That would add one carbon. Then the other substituent is a halogen, like Cl, which is not adding any carbons. So, 6 +1 (from CO) + 0 (from Cl) =7 carbons. Hmm, but the problem states 8 carbons. So that's not matching. So perhaps each substituent adds a carbon.

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl group is part of a larger substituent. Like, for example, an acetyl group (CH2CO-) would add two carbons. But wait, in that case, the substituent would be something like CH2CO- attached to the ring. So, that would add two carbons. Then the other substituent is a halogen, adding zero. So total carbons would be 6 + 2 +0=8. That fits.

Wait, or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, which is attached directly to the ring. So, the group
