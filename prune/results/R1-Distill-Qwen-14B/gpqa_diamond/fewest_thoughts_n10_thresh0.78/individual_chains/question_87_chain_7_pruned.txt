Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see, I'm supposed to find the correct 1H NMR data for a certain compound. The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, ester, or maybe an aldehyde) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, like benzene. And di-substituted, so two substituents. The total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents account for 2 more. But wait, the substituents might have more carbons. Wait, wait, the total is 8 carbons, so benzene (6) plus two substituents: each substituent could be one or more carbons.

Wait, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Oh wait, no: the compound has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone or maybe an ester group) and a halogen. So in the molecule, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but the question says peaks in the FTIR indicate presence of carbonyl (so C=O) and aromatic-halogen. So the substituents are likely one C=O group and one halogen atom.

So the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe an acetyl group) and another is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but let's think about the structure. If the ring is di-substituted, and has a carbonyl group, perhaps in the para position? Or maybe meta. Wait, but the substituents could be ortho, meta, or para. Let me think about the NMR.

The options given are four, and each has different NMR signals. Let me think about each option and see which fits.

First, the substitu
