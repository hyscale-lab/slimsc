Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just add them like we do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of Einstein's theory of relativity. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula here.

Wait, the problem gives two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down into steps.

First, I'll tackle the relative speed. I recall that the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds? Or do I have to use the formula correctly?

Wait, no. The formula is for when you have two velocities, u and v, in the same frame. Oh wait, no—I think I got it wrong. Wait, the formula is when you have an object moving at speed u in a frame S', which itself is moving at speed v relative to frame S. So if u' is the speed in S', then in S it's (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²). But in this case, both astronauts are in the same initial frame, I think. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem states that both are moving in the positive x-direction, so perhaps I'm to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. From A's perspective, what would be B's speed? Or wait, maybe the question is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other. Oh, right! That's what "relative speed" usually means.

So, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame of reference, what is B's speed? Because in classical mechanics, you'd
