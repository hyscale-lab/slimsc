Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is switched off and turned on again along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the energy levels depend on that interaction. When the field direction changes, the system's Hamiltonian changes, which could cause transitions between states and lead to oscillations in expectation values.

Wait, the initial state is the magnetic moment aligned with the +Z field. So the initial state must be the spin-up state along Z, which for spin-1/2 is |↑⟩ in the z-basis. But when the field direction changes to +Y, the Hamiltonian will change from something proportional to S_z to something proportional to S_y.

In quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, it can cause transitions between energy eigenstates. The expectation values of observables can oscillate if the system is in a superposition of states with different energies.

Let me write down the initial and final Hamiltonians. The initial Hamiltonian H1 is proportional to S_z, and the final H2 is proportional to S_y. Since the magnetic field is the same magnitude, the coefficients would be the same, right? So H1 would be something like -γ B S_z, but wait, when the field is applied, the energy is typically -μ·B. Oh wait, wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z. So the energy is E = -mu · B. Oh wait, no, actually, the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, so the energy is E = -μ·B. So for a magnetic field in the +z direction, the energy is E = -μ_z B, which is -γ S_z B.

So H1 would be proportional to S_z. But when the field is turned off and on in the y-direction, the new Hamiltonian H2 is proportional to S_y. So H2 = γ B S_y? Wait, no, let me think. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. But the energy is E = -mu · B. So when the field is along y, E = -gamma S_y B. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but in terms of the spin matrices, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to S_y. But quantum mechanics typically uses H = -γ B S · B. So for a field in the y-direction, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure about the sign. The energy is E = -μ·B. So μ is γ S_z, so E = -γ S_z B when B is along z. So H1 is -γ B S_z. Now, when B is along y, H2 is -γ B S_y. So the Hamiltonian after the switch is H2 = -γ B S_y.

But wait, when the field is turned off, what happens? Oh, the particle's magnetic moment is still present, but the external field is changing. So the time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, but the initial state is the eigenstate of H1 (since the particle is aligned with the B field in z). So the initial state is |↑_z⟩, which is an eigenstate of H1 with energy E1 = -gamma B (ħ/2) * 1. Because S_z for spin-1/2 is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix.

Wait, spin-1/2, so S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So for the initial state |↑z⟩, S_z is ħ/2, so H1 is -γ B S_z = -γ B (ħ/2) * (1/2) ? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E1 = -γ B * (ħ/2) * (1/2)? Wait, no, wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field in the z-direction is H = -γ B S_z. So, since S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_z is the Pauli matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So H1 is -γ B (ħ/2) σ_z / 2? Wait, no. Let me get this right. The spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each equal to (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So H1 = -γ B S_z = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_z.

Similarly, when the field is in y-direction, H2 = -γ B S_y = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

But wait, the question says that the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on. So the initial state is |↑z⟩, which is an eigenstate of H1. But the new Hamiltonian H2 is different.

So the particle is initially in |↑z⟩, which is not an eigenstate of H2. Therefore, it will evolve in time under H2, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment, ⟨S_z⟩.

So to find the time dependence of ⟨S_z⟩, I need to find how the state evolves under H2 and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way by considering the energy difference between the states. Because when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation values oscillate with frequencies determined by the energy differences.

Wait, |↑z⟩ is an eigenstate of H1, but under H2, it's no longer an eigenstate. So the state will evolve. Let me denote the initial state as |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑z⟩.

Under H2, the time evolution is given by |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-i H2 t / ħ) |↑z⟩.

But to find ⟨S_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express |↑z⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of H2. Because then, the time evolution would be straightforward.

What are the eigenstates of H2? H2 is proportional to σ_y, so the eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_y. The eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so H2 has eigenvalues ± (-γ B (ħ/2)).

Wait, H2 is -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y. So its eigenvalues are -γ B (ħ/2) multiplied by eigenvalues of σ_y, which are ±1. So the eigenvalues of H2 are ± (-γ B (ħ/2)).

Wait, but negative times eigenvalue would give the energies. Alternatively, H2 can be written as (γ B ħ / 2) σ_y. Wait no, wait: H2 is -γ B S_y, and S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So H2 = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the eigenvalues of H2 are E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2) * 1 and E_- = - γ B (ħ/2) * (-1) = γ B (ħ/2).

Wait, so the two energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = + (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's compute again. H2 = -γ B S_y. S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So H2 = - γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are 1 and -1, so H2's eigenvalues are E_+ = (-γ B (ħ/2)) * 1 and E_- = (-γ B (ħ/2)) * (-1) = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So the two energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2 ) = gamma B ħ.

So the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ.

Now, the initial state |↑z⟩ is not an eigenstate of H2, so it can be written as a combination of H2's eigenstates. Let me call them |+H2⟩ and |−H2⟩.

The expectation value of S_z will oscillate based on the transition between these states. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference, divided by Planck's constant. So the frequency omega is delta E / ħ.

So omega = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The energy difference is delta E = E_+ - E_-? No, earlier I said E_+ is negative and E_- is positive. So delta E (E_+ - E_-) would be negative. But the magnitude is the same.

But the time evolution leads to oscillations at frequency omega = (delta E) / ħ.

Wait, the energy difference for transitions is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) - (- gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

So delta E is gamma B ħ.

So the angular frequency ω is delta E / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, when the system is in a superposition of two energy eigenstates, the time dependence of the expectation value of an observable (like S_z) typically oscillates with frequency equal to (E2 - E1)/ħ, where E2 and E1 are the energies of the eigenstates involved.

So in this case, the initial state is |↑z⟩. Let me express |↑z⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of H2.

The eigenstates of H2 are |+H2⟩ and |−H2⟩. Since H2 is proportional to σ_y, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_y, which are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_y are |+y⟩ = (|↑x⟩ + i |↓x⟩ ) / sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ = (|↑x⟩ - i |↓x⟩ ) / sqrt(2). Or wait, perhaps the other way around. Let me think.

The eigenstates of σ_y are |+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + i |1⟩ ) / sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ = (|0⟩ - i |1⟩ ) / sqrt(2), assuming the basis is |0⟩ = |↑x⟩ and |1⟩ = |↓x⟩. But I might be mixing up the conventions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the |↑z⟩ and |↓z⟩ can be written as a combination of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩.

The standard transformation between the z and y bases is:

|↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2)
|↓z⟩ = (|+y⟩ − |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, let me check. The eigenstates of σ_y are:

σ_y |+y⟩ = +|+y⟩
σ_y |−y⟩ = -|−y⟩

In the z basis, |+y⟩ can be written as (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩)/sqrt(2), and |−y⟩ as (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩)/sqrt(2).

So to express |↑z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

|↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Because substituting the expressions:

(|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2) = [ (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩ ) + (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩ ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) ) 
= [ 2 |↑z⟩ ] / 2 
= |↑z⟩.

So the initial state is |↑z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So when the system evolves under H2, each component will pick up a phase factor based on their energy eigenvalues.

So |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-i H2 t / ħ) |↑z⟩ = (e^(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y⟩ + e^(-i E_- t / ħ) |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

The energies E_+ and E_- are as calculated before: E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

So substituting,

E_+ = -(gamma B ħ) / 2,
E_- = (gamma B ħ) / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i (gamma B ħ t )/(2 ħ) } |+y⟩ + e^{ - i (gamma B ħ t )/(2 ħ) } |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2)
Simplify the exponents:

(gamma B ħ t )/(2 ħ) = (gamma B t ) / 2.

So,

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{ i (gamma B t / 2 ) } |+y⟩ + e^{ -i (gamma B t / 2 ) } |−y⟩ ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to compute ⟨S_z⟩, which is the expectation value of S_z in this state.

We can write S_z as (ħ/2) σ_z.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ ].

But perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value directly.

Let me proceed.

Express |ψ(t)⟩ in terms of |↑z⟩ and |↓z⟩.

We know that |+y⟩ = (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩ ) / sqrt(2),
|−y⟩ = (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So substituting into |ψ(t)⟩:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i theta} (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩ ) + e^{-i theta} (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩ ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)),
where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Wait, sqrt(2) comes from each |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, so multiplying by 1/sqrt(2) outside, and each term is (1/sqrt(2)) times the expression. So overall factor is (1/2) when you multiply the two sqrt(2) terms.

Wait, no. The overall factor is 1/sqrt(2) times each term, so when you add them, it's (1/sqrt(2)) * [ ... ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute:

|ψ(t)⟩ = ( e^{i theta} |+y⟩ + e^{-i theta} |−y⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

= ( e^{i theta} (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩ ) + e^{-i theta} (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩ ) ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )

= [ e^{i theta} (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩ ) + e^{-i theta} (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩ ) ] / 2.

Expanding this,

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |↑z⟩ + i (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |↓z⟩ ] / 2.

Using Euler's formula: e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta,
and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.

So,

= [ 2 cos theta |↑z⟩ + i * 2i sin theta |↓z⟩ ] / 2.

Simplify: 2i sin theta = 2i sin theta.

So,

= [ 2 cos theta |↑z⟩ - 2 sin theta |↓z⟩ ] / 2.

Which simplifies to:

= cos theta |↑z⟩ - sin theta |↓z⟩.

So |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |↑z⟩ - sin(theta) |↓z⟩, where theta = (gamma B t)/2.

Now, compute ⟨S_z⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.

S_z for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) σ_z. So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) [ ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ ].

But since σ_z |↑z⟩ = +|↑z⟩, and σ_z |↓z⟩ = -|↓z⟩.

So,

⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos(theta) ⟨↑z| - sin(theta) ⟨↓z| ] σ_z [ cos(theta) |↑z⟩ - sin(theta) |↓z⟩ ]

= cos^2(theta) ⟨↑z | σ_z |↑z⟩ - cos(theta) sin(theta) ⟨↑z| σ_z |↓z⟩ 

- sin(theta) cos(theta) ⟨↓z| σ_z |↑z⟩ 

+ sin^2(theta) ⟨↓z| σ_z |↓z⟩.

But σ_z |↑z⟩ is |↑z⟩, so ⟨↑z|σ_z|↑z⟩ = 1.

Similarly, σ_z |↓z⟩ = -|↓z⟩, so ⟨↓z|σ_z|↓z⟩ = -1.

The cross terms: ⟨↑z| σ_z |↓z⟩ = 0, and same for the other cross term.

So,

⟨σ_z⟩ = cos^2(theta) * 1 + sin^2(theta) * (-1) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

Therefore, ⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

But theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta = gamma B t.

So,

⟨S_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but ⟨S_z⟩ is in terms of the spin operator, which has units of ħ/2. So the maximum value is ħ/2.

But wait, the question says the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z, so the oscillation of mu_z is gamma ⟨S_z⟩.

Wait, no, the question says the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment (mu_z) starts oscillating. So they're asking about ⟨mu_z⟩.

Because mu = gamma S_z, so ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨S_z⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but this seems to have units of gamma * (ħ/2) which is (gamma ħ)/2. Wait, but gamma has units of (rad/s)/(Tesla), and B is Tesla, so gamma B has units of rad/s. So (gamma B) t is dimensionless, as expected.

But the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function. The argument is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

Wait, but in the expression for ⟨mu_z⟩, it's cos(gamma B t), so the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the options are: option B is gamma B.

But wait, let me make sure. The oscillation frequency is the frequency at which the quantity varies sinusoidally. The argument is (omega) t, so omega is the angular frequency.

So in this case, the frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.

But wait, let me go through the steps again. Did I miss a factor of 1/2 somewhere?

Wait, the initial state:

|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |↑z⟩ - sin(theta) |↓z⟩.

theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So when computing ⟨sigma_z⟩, we get cos(2 theta). So the argument is gamma B t.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me think about the energy levels again. The energy levels are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2, E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

The transition frequency would be (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which matches.

So the average of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment, which is gamma S_z. So the average mu_z is gamma times S_z, and since S_z oscillates with frequency gamma B, mu_z should oscillate with the same frequency.

Wait, but in the expression I had, mu_z is (gamma ħ/2) cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: gamma*B.


To determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment, we analyze the system’s evolution under the changing magnetic field.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   The particle is initially in the state \( |↑_z\rangle \), an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \( H_1 = -\gamma B S_z \) when the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The eigenvalues of \( S_z \) are \( \pm \hbar/2 \), so the energy levels are \( E_{\pm} = \mp \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \).

2. **Change in Magnetic Field**:  
   When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian becomes \( H_2 = -\gamma B S_y \). The eigenstates of \( H_2 \) are the eigenstates of \( S_y \), denoted as \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \).

3. **Initial State in New Basis**:  
   The initial state \( |↑_z\rangle \) is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of \( H_2 \) as:
   \[
   |↑_z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle + |-y\rangle \right).
   \]

4. **Time Evolution**:  
   Under \( H_2 \), the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where \( E_+ = \frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \) and \( E_- = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \). Substituting these energies, the time evolution becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |↑_z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |↓_z\rangle.
   \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:  
   The z-component of the spin operator \( S_z \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \hbar/2 \). The expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) is computed as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2}.
   \]
   Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x) = \cos(2x) \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of \( \langle S_z \rangle \) occurs at the angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \). Since the magnetic moment \( \mu_z = \gamma S_z \), the oscillation frequency of \( \mu_z \) is the same as that of \( \langle S_z \rangle \).

### Conclusion:
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment is \( \gamma B \).

**Answer: B**
