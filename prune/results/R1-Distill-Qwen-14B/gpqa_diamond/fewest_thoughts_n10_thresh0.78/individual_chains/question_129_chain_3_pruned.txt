Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let's break down each step.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:
a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR spectra: A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different ketones. So, E is a ketone.

Let me think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups, typically in a nucleophilic addition. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, it would form a similar structure. But wait, the IR of A is at 1750, which is typical for a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde). But in the options, E is a ketone, so perhaps A is also a ketone.

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group attached. Alternatively, maybe A is an ester or something else, but 1750 is more in the range of a ketone or aldehyde. Hmm.

But let's look at hint a). It says that A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to give 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Phosphorous ylides are used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. The structure given after the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So this product has a cyclopentane ring with substituents.

Wait, the ylide must have the structure that would form the propan-2-ylidene group. The Wittig reagent (ylide) is typically generated from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine, then treated with a strong base.

The product has a cyclopentane ring. So the starting compound A, which is reacting with the ylide, must be a carbonyl compound. Because in a Wittig reaction, the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon.

So, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure mentally. The cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. There's a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be =CH-C(CH3)2, perhaps?

Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the substituent on the cyclopentane. So the structure is cyclopentane with substituents at 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), and 4 (propan-2-ylidene). The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)= group? Or perhaps it's a substituent where the double bond is between
