Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelength of maximum intensity for a black body is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law says lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same since b is a constant. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, but in this case, since the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, maybe the radial velocity doesn't affect the calculation because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Or wait, does it? Wait, when calculating observed quantities like flux or apparent brightness, Doppler shift can affect the observed wavelength and brightness, but the actual luminosity (intrinsic) depends on the star's radius and temperature. Oh, but the question is about the computed luminosity, so perhaps they're considering the rest frame, not the observed. So maybe the radial velocities don't affect the calculation of luminosity here. Or maybe they affect the observed flux, but the luminosity itself is based on the star's intrinsic properties. I think for luminosity, we can ignore the radial velocity because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So I can focus on the radius and temperature.

So, to find the luminosity ratio, I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, because lambda_max is same, then L is proportional to R². So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, but wait a second. Hmm, because maybe the observed brightness (apparent luminosity) is affected by Doppler shift. Let me think again. The problem states that the stars' radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, but when you observe a star moving towards or away from you (radial velocity), the light is Doppler shifted. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, which would make it appear brighter in the blue, but the star's intrinsic properties (like luminosity) are the same. However, in the problem, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, but since we're considering the maximum emission, which depends on temperature, but because of Doppler shift, the observed maximum could be different. Wait, but the question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So for each star, the observed maximum lambda is same. So that would mean that their temperatures as observed are the same. So, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, which would then have to be accounted for.

Wait, this might complicate things. Let me think
