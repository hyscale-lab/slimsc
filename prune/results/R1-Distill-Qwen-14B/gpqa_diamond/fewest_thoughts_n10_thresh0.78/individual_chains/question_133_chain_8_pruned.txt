Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 gram of KH2PO4 and 1.00 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-?) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on phosphate equilibria, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps. Each step has its own Ka value. The problem gives me Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. So the species involved are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's write down their dissociations:

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since it's Na2HPO4, which is the disodium salt of HPO4^2-). The water part probably doesn't affect the ions much, so I can ignore it for the ionic forms.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are adjacent species in the phosphate acid's dissociation. I think that in solution, they can interconvert based on the pH.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it PO4^3-? Hmm. I think orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-, but sometimes people refer to HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check: H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). Second, H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). Third, HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So, HPO4^2- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- is the hydrogen phosphate or orthophosphate? Or is it the other way around? I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, maybe in this context, the question refers to the concentration of HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate. Well, perhaps I should proceed with that.

But maybe I should clarify that. So the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then we need to find [PO4^3-]. But if HPO4^2- is considered orthophosphate, then [HPO4^2-] is the answer. Hmm. Let me think. Well, from the given data, for H3PO4, the second dissociation is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2=6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12). So, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- and the conjugate acid of PO4^3-.

But I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, the most deprotonated form. So the question is about [PO4^3-]. But wait, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because of the salts
