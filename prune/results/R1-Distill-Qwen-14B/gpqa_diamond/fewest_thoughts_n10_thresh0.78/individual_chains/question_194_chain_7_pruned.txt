Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, so first I need to find all possible states of the three spins. Each spin has two options, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them. Maybe it's easier if I represent each state as (S1, S2, S3). So the possible states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these states, I need to compute E and then calculate exp(-βE) for each, sum them all up to get Z.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Because some states might have the same energy. Let's think about the energy expression. E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let's compute the terms inside the brackets for each state.

Let me denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So for each state, compute S, then E = -J S.

Wait, so E depends on S. Let me compute S for each state.

Taking state 1: all +1. S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So sum S = 3. E = -J*3.

State 2: (+1, +1, -1). S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum S = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. E = J*1? Wait, wait no: E = -J * S. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J * S. So if S is 3, E is -3J. If S is -1, E is J.

Hmm. Let's compute S for each state.

State 1: All +1. S = 3 → E = -3J.
State 2: (+, +, -). S = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E = J.
State 3: (+,-, +). S=1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 → E=J.
State 4: (+,-,-). S= (-
