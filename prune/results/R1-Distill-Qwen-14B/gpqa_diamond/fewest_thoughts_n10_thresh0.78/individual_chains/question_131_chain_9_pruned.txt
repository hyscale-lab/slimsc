Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what info I can gather.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's been dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The key here is the 2D NOESY NMR data, where the major product has a cross-peak that the minor lacks.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a diacid usually forms an anhydride. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, when it's dehydrated, the geometry might influence the structure of the anhydride.

The anhydride's NMR data: 1H shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons typically appear, but wait, the molecule is an anhydride. Oh wait, maybe it's an aliphatic proton? No, 7 ppm is more likely an aromatic or maybe an acidic proton. Wait, but in an anhydride, the carbonyls are around 165-185 ppm in 13C. The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165. 137 is probably a carbon attached to oxygen, maybe an spÂ² carbon, like a carbonyl adjacent. 165 is likely a carbonyl. So maybe the anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are connected, perhaps a cyclic anhydride like a five-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid. When you dehydrate two carboxylic acids, you get an anhydride. The positions of the two carboxylic acid groups would determine the structure of the anhydride. Since the original acid had a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride with the two carbonyl groups adjacent, perhaps. So maybe it's a five-membered cyclic anhydride, like maleic anhydride (but that's a dienophile, right?).

But wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That doesn't fit maleic anhydride because maleic has two sets of protons. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has no protons because both carbonyl groups are in a cyclic structure without any adjacent protons? Or maybe it's a symmetric anhydride where all protons are equivalent.

Wait, another possibility: the anhydride is such that all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent. For example, maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with two carbonyl groups, but that would comp
