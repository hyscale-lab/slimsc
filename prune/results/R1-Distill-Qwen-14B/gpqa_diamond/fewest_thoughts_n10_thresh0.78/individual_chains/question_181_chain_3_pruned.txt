Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux on Earth. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but I'll try to recall.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. So, wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core, right? The proton-proton (pp) chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh wait, I remember that the pp-III branch involves the fusion of two protons via a different pathway than the pp-I and pp-II. I think pp-III involves the emission of a positron and a neutrino when two protons combine, but I'm not entirely sure.

So, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need the ratio of their fluxes: flux band1 over flux band2.

Wait, so neutrino flux from the Sun is affected by the solar reactions. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces electron neutrinos (Î½_e) via the reaction where two protons collide, one emits a positron and a neutrino, turning into a neutron, which then captures a proton to become a deuteron. That's the process that emits a neutrino. So, if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those neutrinos would stop too.

But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, only the pp-III branch is stopped. So the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active. Or are there other neutrino sources in the Sun?

Neutrinos in the Sun are mainly from the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos via the same process as pp-III, but at higher energies maybe? Or wait, no. Let me think. The main source of solar neutrinos is the ppI branch (the most common one) and the ppII and ppIII are variants. Or does ppIII happen at higher masses or something?

Alternatively, I remember that neutrinos are produced in the CNO cycle as well. But the CNO cycle is more dominant in higher
