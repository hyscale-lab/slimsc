Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to move back and forth, and this movement shifts the spectral lines we observe. The shift tells us about the planet's presence and some of its characteristics.

Alright, the question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet with similar mass to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So the stars are identical in mass, and their planets are similar in mass. But the RV measurements are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 milliangstrom for planet #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, let me think about the RV method. The velocity semi-amplitude, K, is the maximum velocity the star moves towards or away from us due to the planet. I think K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period and distance. Oh right, the formula for K is something like K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) )... Wait, maybe I should recall the exact expression.

Alternatively, I remember that the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So if the spectral line shifts by a certain amount (measured in milliangstroms), that's a measure of the velocity (because the shift is due to the Doppler effect). So if planet #2's spectral line has a shift of 7 milliangstroms and planet #1 is 5, the velocities are in the same proportion, right? So K2 is 7/5 times K1. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

But we want to find the ratio of the orbital periods, P2/P1. So how does K relate to the period?

The formula for K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (2π) / (P) ) ]^(1/3) / (c), where c is the speed of light. Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the simplified expression. Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ [ (G M_p ) / (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) / c. Alternatively, the more simplified version is K ≈ ( (27 π G M_p ) / (8 c^3 M_star^2) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, perhaps it's
