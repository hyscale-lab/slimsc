Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, each with a similar base but varying substituents. Let me think through the clues one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, especially in carboxylic acids because they have strong hydrogen bonding. So the compound must have a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). That makes sense because all the options end with COOH, so that's consistent.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. This peak is likely due to a carbonyl group (C=O). Since we already have a carboxylic acid group, that 1700 peak probably corresponds to the C=O in the COOH. So that's another point for all options, but it doesn't narrow it down yet.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, they aren't showing up in the NMR as vinyl signals. Wait, but all the options are carboxylic acids, so any double bonds would have to be elsewhere. Looking at the structures, all the options are branched without any obvious double bonds, so that might not be an issue. But I should confirm.

Next, the NMR has various splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. Let's think about what these splitting patterns mean.

A doublet of triplets of quartets is a bit complex. Let's break it down. Each splitting level comes from coupling with adjacent protons. So, the first split (doublet) comes from one neighboring set. Then, each of those splits into triplets due to another neighboring set. Then each of those splits into quartets. That suggests that a proton is next to three different sets of protons, each contributing their own splitting.

Wait, or maybe it's that each coupling is from different groups. For example, if a proton is adjacent to two different types of protons, each with different coupling constants, that could lead to such a complex pattern. Alternatively, vicinal coupling (coupling between adjacent carbons) may be happening here.

Looking at the options, the structures have various substituents. Let's imagine each structure and see what their NMR would look like.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would be something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)(CH2CH3)C-C(H)(CH2CH3)-CH2COOH? Not sure, but the point is, the central carbons have substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH3-C(CH2CH3)(H)-C(CH2CH3)(H)-COOH. So two isopropyl-like groups attached to the central carbons.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the two middle carbons has a methyl group and two CH3 groups attached. So it would be (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH? Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2CH-C(CH3
