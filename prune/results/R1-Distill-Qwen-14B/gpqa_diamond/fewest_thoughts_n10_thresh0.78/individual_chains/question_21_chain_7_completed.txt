Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about isomers and their properties, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional is about the arrangement of atoms, while stereoisomers are about the spatial arrangement.

The problem has two parts: part A and part B. I need to figure out each separately.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two adjacent atoms, resulting in different tautomers. For example, between ketones and enols, or between different forms like in tautomers of sugars.

So, let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound. There are two common forms, para-benzoquinone and ortho. Oh wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Like O=C6H4=O. So it's a diketone. Do diketones undergo tautomerism? Wait, tautomerism usually involves moving a hydrogen and a lone pair. Diketones might have enol forms, but wait, in this case, the quinone structure is already in a conjugated form. Wait, but for tautomerism, the molecule must have an adjacent H and an O that can shift. Let's see, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, that's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5.

Wait, wait. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? And cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be (CH2)2C=O in each of the three positions. So, wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a cyclic trione, meaning three ketone groups at alternate positions.

So, for tautomerism, a molecule must have a structure where a hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group, so that it can tautomerize. For example, in a diketone, if adjacent carbonyl groups have H's, then tautomerism is possible. Wait, but in benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons (if it's para, no, wait para would be opposite, but ortho would be adjacent). Wait, benzoquinone is either para or ortho. So, in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other, so no adjacent H. In ortho, they are next to each other. So, does that affect tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism in quinones. Let me think: for tautomerism to occur, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, in benzoquinone, if the two ketones are ortho, then each of those carbons would have adjacent H's. So, perhaps they can tautomerize.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can tautomerize into another form. But wait, waitâ€”another possibility: is tautomerism about keto-enol tautomerism? So, if a compound has a carbonyl group, it can form an enol if there's an alpha H. Let's think: in benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. So, for a para-benzoquinone, each C=O is attached to two benzene carbons, which don't have H's because they're part of the aromatic ring. So, maybe there's no alpha H for tautomerism.

Wait, no, wait: the structure of para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, so each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (the benzylic positions) don't have H's because they're part of the ring. So, in that case, no H's to tautomerize. So, para-benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because there's no alpha H.

But wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. The structure is a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5. So each ketone is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the cyclohexane ring is fully substituted with ketones. Wait, no: the numbering is 1,3,5. So each ketone is at every other carbon. The positions between them are CH2 groups. So, for example, carbon 2 is CH2 between carbonyl groups at 1 and 3.

Wait, so each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. The adjacent carbons (2,4,6) are connected to CH2 groups, which have H's. So, in this case, the molecule would have alpha H's (like the H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl group). So, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but wait: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is flanked by CH2 groups. So, each of those CH2 groups is adjacent to a carbonyl, so each has two H's. So, the molecule can tautomerize by moving H's.

Wait, but hang on. Tautomerism usually requires that the molecule can form an enol. For that, the carbonyl must have an alpha H. So, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, yes, each carbonyl has an alpha H (on the adjacent CH2 groups), so it can tautomerize. Whereas in benzoquinone, the alpha positions are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have H's attached, so no alpha H, hence no tautomerism.

Wait, but wait para-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other, each attached to two benzene carbons. Those benzene carbons are part of the ring, so they have no H's attached. So, no alpha H, so no tautomerism.

So, if the question is which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So, if benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can, then part A's answer is benzoquinone for not showing tautomerism. Or wait, wait! Wait, the question says: "the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)". So, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can, then the one that cannot is benzoquinone. So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but wait another thing: Maybe I got benzoquinone wrong. Let me double-check. If benzoquinone is the para form, each carbonyl is attached to two benzene carbons. So, no alpha H, so no tautomerism. So, yes, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

So part A: A is benzoquinone. So looking at the options, options B and D have A as benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, i.e., a carbon atom with four different substituents. Alternatively, it can arise from other forms of chirality, like in meso compounds, but let me focus on chiral centers for now.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw its structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Hmm, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH? No, wait, no.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid has three carbons: carboxylic acid is the first carbon, then the second, then the third. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, when esterified with methanol, the methyl ester would be CH3O-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up things.

Wait, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be: the carboxylic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but in that structure, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is CH2OH. Then the third carbon is the COOCH3 group. Wait, the molecule would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second one) is connected to: CH2OH, CH2, COOCH3, and what else? Wait, no, the central carbon is the second carbon in propanoate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

CH3-C(OOCH3)-CH2-OH ?

No, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the acid and the alcohol. The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, correction: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH (three carbons: COOH, CH2, CH3). So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon: CH3CH(OH)COOH.

Wait, but that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, the numbering is from the COOH group. So, the first carbon is COOH, the second is CH2, the third is CH3. Wait, but that wouldn't have a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to two CH2 groups, a COOCH3, and an OH. So, does that carbon have four different substituents?

Wait, substituents on the central carbon: one is OH, the other is CH2COOCH3, another is CH2-, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, the central carbon is CH2-OH, which is connected to CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as follows: The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Then, the ester would be formed by replacing the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, wait, that makes more sense. So, the structure is CH3-O-C(O)-CH(OH)-CH3. No, wait, the esterification would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OR. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that structure, the central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to two CH2 groups, a COOCH3 group, and an OH. So, substituents: two CH2 (but one is connected to OH), COOCH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, with substituents: COOCH3, CH2-OH, and two H's.

Wait, no. Let's model it as:

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: it's an ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. Wait, so the structure would be:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the CH2) is connected to:

- One CH2(OH) group,

- One CH2 group (which connects to COOCH3),

- Two H's.

Wait, no, because in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the central carbon is the second CH2 in the chain. So, substituents are:

- One CH2(OH),

- One COOCH3,

- Two H's on the same carbon.

Wait, so the central carbon has two H's, so it's not a chiral center. Because a chiral center must have four different substituents. If two substituents are the same (like two H's), then it's not chiral.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another possibility: if the structure is different. What if it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? No, that's not possible because that would be a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3, which would make it a secondary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the ester being formed from the acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central CH2 group is connected to:

- CH2OH,

- COOCH3,

- And two H's.

So, it's a tetrahedral carbon with substituents: two H's, CH2OH, and COOCH3. So, two substituents are the same (H), so not a chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me see: the structure would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH, connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And another substituent. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the carbon chain.

Wait, propanoate is a three-carbon chain. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, the structure is:

Position 1: COOCH3,

Position 2: OH,

Position 3: CH3.

Ah, so the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the second carbon, with substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the COOCH3). Wait, but in that setup, the central carbon is connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3's carbon). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon, but wait, maybe not.

Wait, the molecule would be:

CH3 â€“ C(OH) â€“ COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. The carbon from which the COOCH3 is attached.

Wait, but in this case, the central carbon is connected to:

CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is the same as the COOCH3's carbon). Wait, but in reality, the adjacent carbon is a carbonyl group. So, maybe the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And a double-bonded O? No, because it's a carbonyl group.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And the carbon from the COOCH3 group (which is itself a carbonyl group). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And the adjacent carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And a carbonyl group (C=O).

Wait, but that would make the substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a double bond. So, four different substituents. Hence, it would be a chiral center. Thus, the compound would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon would be connected to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a double bond (which is a carbon with a double bond, so it's a substituent that's different from the others). So, that would make it a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the structure. If the structure is CH3-C(OH)=C(O)OCH3, that would be a different scenario. But wait, the molecule in question is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is an ester, so it's not an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, no, it's a saturated ester.

So, the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH, which is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And another CH.

Wait, wait, no, because COOCH3 is a substituent on the same carbon. Wait, perhaps the molecule is arranged as:

CH3
|
C(OH) - COOCH3

Wait, that's not possible as a three-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, which isn't right. Hmm, I'm getting mixed up here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that structure, the central carbon (the second CH2) has substituents: one CH2(OH), one CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So, substituents: two H's, a CH2OH group, and a CH2COOCH3 group.

So, for the central carbon, substituents are:

1. H,

2. H,

3. CH2OH,

4. CH2COOCH3.

Wait, so two substituents are H's, which are same. So, it's not a chiral center because it must have four different substituents to be chiral. So, in this case, the central carbon has two H's, so no.

But wait, wait a second. Alternatively, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to:

CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another carbon (the carbonyl carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group). Does that make all four substituents different?

In that case, substituents would be:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. (the adjacent C, which is the carbonyl C in COOCH3, which is connected to O and another OCH3).

Wait, but the substituent on the central carbon is the COOCH3 group, which is a single substituent. So, the four substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is a carbonyl C). So, are they all different?

Hmm, the adjacent carbon is part of a carbonyl, so it's a double bond. Wait, but in this case, the central carbon is connected to a carbonyl group, making it a ketone. No, because in the ester, the carbonyl is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the carbonyl is in the COOCH3 part, and the central C is attached to CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another C which is the carbonyl C. But the C connected via the COOCH3 is part of the carbonyl group, which is a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a double bond (but that's not possible, because the next C is double-bonded to O in the COOCH3 group, so the central C is connected to that C via a single bond. So, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent C (which is part of the carbonyl), which is a different substituent.

So, if all four substituents are different, that would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of other methods. Another way to approach this is to think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it does, it can't have optical isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move on to the second compound and see.

Dimethyl fumarate: Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is cis-butenedioic acid. So, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid with methanol. So, its structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOCCHCHCOOH, but in the cis configuration. So, the diester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is the cis isomer, so it's HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH but in a cis configuration around the double bond. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis). So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the cis configuration.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Let me think: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would have each COOH replaced by COOCH3. So, structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the molecule is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be right. Let me draw it correctly.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the diester would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two COOH groups is esterified with methanol, becoming COOCH3 groups. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the double bond is between the two middle CH groups. So, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be because each COOH is on a different carbon. So, the correct structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2? No, perhaps I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that's for malonic acid's ester, not fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-COOH, but that's incorrect because that's succinic acid. No, no. Fumaric acid is the cis dihydroxy form of maleic acid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond.

So, when esterified with methanol, it becomes:

CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each COOH becomes COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3.

Wait, that's not possible, because the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that would be the same as (COOCH3)2C=CH2, which isn't correct because the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So, perhaps the correct structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CHâ‚‚=C-CHâ‚‚
     /
COOCH3

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCH3)â‚‚.

Wait, that would imply that the two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon, which is possible.

So, in this structure, the molecule is CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCH3)â‚‚. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the central structure is:

COOCH3
     \
CHâ‚‚ - C = C - CHâ‚‚
     /
COOCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
    /  \
COOCH3  CH3

But wait, no, the correct structure is that each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to each of the double-bonded carbons.

So, the structure is:

CHâ‚‚(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

But that would mean each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
    /  \
COOCH3  COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right either. I'm getting confused, perhaps I should think about the symmetry.

In any case, the molecule has two ester groups attached to adjacent carbons, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is symmetrical because of the double bond.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it won't have a chiral center. Wait, but if it's a trans configuration, would that affect the symmetry?

Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is the cis isomer. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is:

      COOCH3
       \
CHâ‚‚=C-CHâ‚‚
       /
      COOCH3

Wait, but the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides because of the double bond's geometry. Wait, no, in the cis configuration, the two substituents (COOCH3) are on the same side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to each of the two CH groups that are double-bonded.

So, the structure is:

      O
      ||
O-C-OCH3
     /   \
    C=C
     \   /
      O-C-OCH3
      ||
      O

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Each of the two middle carbons has a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. No, that would have four carbons, but I think fumarate has four carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. Because if it does, it won't have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCH3)â‚‚. Wait, that's a four-carbon molecule, with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Each of the 2 and 3 carbons has a COOCH3 group.

Wait, so the structure is:

CHâ‚‚-CH(COOCH3)â‚‚

But that's not correct because the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCH3)â‚‚

So, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon, making that carbon have two identical substituents (COOCH3). So, in that case, that carbon is CH(COOCH3)â‚‚.

So, the molecule is: CHâ‚‚=CH(COOCH3)â‚‚.

In this structure, the central carbon (the one with the double bond) is attached to:

- CHâ‚‚ from the left,

- COOCH3,

- COOCH3,

- And CH from the right.

So, substituents are CHâ‚‚, COOCH3, COOCH3, and CH. So, two substituents are the same (COOCH3), so that carbon is not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait, the other carbon in the double bond? The other carbon (the right CH) is attached to:

- CH from the left,

- Two H's,

- COOCH3,

- And the other substituent is what? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, in the cis configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral.

Wait, but does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule: the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetric across the plane that bisects the double bond between the two carbons. So, if you mirror the molecule across that plane, it looks the same. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. Hence, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another approach: optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. If the molecule is symmetrical, it doesn't have a non-superimposable mirror image. So, if dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, it won't have optical isomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think: in the cis form, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side. So, the molecule is symmetric upon a plane that bisects the double bond, making it achiral.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Because if the substituents are on the same side, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think. When the substituents are on the same side, the molecule may lack a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule being meso. If the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and won't exhibit optical isomerism.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So, it's a meso compound, meaning it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then both methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate don't show optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the options give one as the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. Earlier, I was confused about the structure. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- And the adjacent carbon, which is part of the carbonyl group, but in this case, the COOCH3 is attached to the same carbon as the OH.

Wait, perhaps that central carbon is a chiral center. Because all four substituents are different: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the carbonyl group).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, the substituent from that carbon is a double bond, which is a different type of substituent.

So, if all four substituents are different, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But earlier, I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I was wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't as I thought. Let me look for another approach. Maybe I should use the rule of thumb that if a molecule has a stereogenic center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if there's a stereogenic center (chiral center), then it can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, let's count the substituents on the central carbon (the one with the OH).

Assuming the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is part of the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but in that case, the substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. The adjacent carbon (which is the same as the COOCH3's carbon, but in reality, that carbon is double-bonded to O, making it part of a carbonyl group.

Hmm, perhaps in this structure, the adjacent substituent is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, the substituent is a carbonyl group, which is different from the others.

Wait, but in that case, the four substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a double bond (which is a different substituent than any of the others).

So, if that's the case, all four substituents are different, making it a chiral center.

But wait, the adjacent substituent is part of a double bond, so perhaps it's not a substituent but a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected via a single bond to the adjacent carbon, which is double-bonded to O.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3 - C(OH) - C(=O)OCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (C(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- C(=O)OCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is the C(=O)OCH3 carbon).

Wait, but that adjacent carbon is double-bonded to O, so the substituent is part of a carbonyl group.

In this scenario, the four substituents on the central carbon would be:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. The adjacent C (which is part of the carbonyl group, so it's a different substituent).

So, all four are different, making it a chiral center.

Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in this structure, the central carbon didn't have four different substituents because of the two H's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structures. Another way: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (group A),

- OH (group B),

- COOCH3 (group C),

- and a CH, which is connected to the COOCH3 group (group D).

Wait, but group D is the same as group C? No, because group C is the entire COOCH3 substituent, while group D is the adjacent carbon (which is connected to COOCH3).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a simpler case. Take the molecule:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon is the one with OH. Its substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, so perhaps it's considered as a substituent. So, the four substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. CHâ‚‚ (but that's not correct, perhaps).

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think about the possibility of both compounds and see which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a symmetrical molecule (cis), while methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon has two H's, making it not chiral. But if it's CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is such that the central carbon is not a chiral center, while dimethyl fumarate is not a chiral molecule either because of symmetry.

Wait, this is getting a bit muddled. Let me think about another approach. For a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center, or another form of chirality.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's see. The molecule is an ester, so the structure would be:

R-O-CO-R', where R is methyl and R' is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So, the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of the COOCH3 group, which is a carbonyl. So, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is a carbonyl group, a different substituent).

So, all four substituents are different, making it a chiral center. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, in this structure, the central carbon is attached to a COOCH3 group, which is a substituent. So, the substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. The adjacent carbon (connected via a single bond to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is part of a carbonyl group, so perhaps that substituent is a C=O group, which is different from the others.

So, yes, that would make the central carbon a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

But in that case, the other compound, dimethyl fumarate, doesn't have a chiral center because it's symmetrical, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, so it's a meso compound, hence no optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? Benzoquinone (A).

Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism? Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and doesn't have optical isomerism, so the correct answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, part A is about which doesn't show tautomerism. If A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does show tautomerism, that's incorrect because the question asks for the one that doesn't. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: A = benzoquinone (correct for part A), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (correct for part B). So option B says A is benzoquinone (no tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism). So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and doesn't. So, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the options:

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties as follows:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, typically involving carbonyl groups and alpha hydrogens. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The alpha positions (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) are part of the aromatic ring and lack alpha hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Thus, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (positions 2, 4, and 6) are CHâ‚‚ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) or another form of chirality.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CHâ‚ƒ-C(OH)-COOCHâ‚ƒ. The central carbon (C(OH)) is bonded to:
   - CHâ‚ƒ,
   - OH,
   - COOCHâ‚ƒ,
   - And the adjacent carbon (part of the carbonyl group).  
   All four substituents are different, making this carbon a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CHâ‚‚=C(COOCHâ‚ƒ)â‚‚. The molecule is symmetrical due to the cis configuration of the double bond, and it lacks a chiral center. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from Part A and Part B:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is:

**Answer: B**
