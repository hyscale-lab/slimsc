Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, first, I think I need to figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Let me check that.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, but when we dilute it, the concentration changes. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So, the new concentration of acetic acid will be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's calculate that: (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, and 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct. So, the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So, the acetic acid will neutralize the NaOH.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Wait, how do I find the equivalence point first? Because knowing the equivalence point will help determine how much NaOH is added at 25%.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So, the
