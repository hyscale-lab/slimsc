Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

So, the question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are A to D with different distances. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma times beta. Because when a particle is moving relativistically, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation.

Wait, the mean decay length formula is L = c * gamma * beta * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. But tau is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the width Γ is connected to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is tau ≈ ħ / Γ. Because a broader width (larger Γ) means a shorter lifetime.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using the width Γ.
2. Find the Lorentz gamma factor for the particle.
3. Find the beta factor (v/c).
4. Combine these to compute the decay length.

First, tau calculation. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are compatible. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which
