Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves a mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm, aromatic compounds with C10H14, so each compound is a substituted benzene. Wait, C10H14 would mean benzene (C6H6) with four substituents, each probably a methyl group. Because 6 carbons from benzene plus 4 methyl groups (each is 1 C) would give 10 carbons. So each is a tetramethylbenzene.

The NMR signals: aromatic protons are typically around 6-7 ppm. If there are two singlets, maybe each corresponds to a set of equivalent protons in each compound.

Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, so each compound's protons contribute equally to the NMR. So each singlet in the aromatic region comes from each compound. So each compound must have a set of equivalent aromatic protons that don't split each other—so they're either all the same or in such a symmetrical position that they're equivalent.

Let me think about the structures. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4 is like a para-substituted meta arrangement, maybe? Let me draw that. 1,2,3,4 would have two methyl groups adjacent (1,2), then another adjacent (3,4). Wait, is that possible? Wait, no, benzene is a ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 would be three methyl groups in a row and one across? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions—so the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4 around the ring. So the structure would have methyl groups in a line. But wait, that may cause some symmetry.

Wait, but 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would be a para-substituted derivative? No, wait, 1,2,3,4 would be four adjacent positions, which in a ring would form a sort of square around the benzene. Wait, but wait, a benzene ring can't have four in a row because it's a six-membered ring. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, which would make a four-membered substituent arrangement. But that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Hmm,
