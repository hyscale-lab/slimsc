Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. A particle in a two-dimensional potential, and I need to find the energy spectrum. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can break it down. So it's a function of r and θ, which suggests it's in polar coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be solved by separating variables, especially if the potential depends only on r and θ.

Wait, but how do I simplify this potential? Let me try to reorganize it. The terms are (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, maybe I can factor out the r². So V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Does that help? Maybe I can write this in terms of some other coordinate system or perhaps a transformation.

Wait, another thought: in two dimensions, when the potential depends on r and θ, sometimes it's helpful to use coordinates that separate the problem. Let's think about the form of the Hamiltonian. The kinetic energy is in polar coordinates (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). So the total Hamiltonian is that plus the potential.

But the potential here is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the (1/2)k r²: that gives (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, but 1 + 3 cos²θ can be rewritten. Let's see: 3 cos²θ = 3/2 (1 + cos 2θ), because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So, substituting that in: 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's compute that: 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

Wait, so the potential becomes (1/2)k r² * [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Wait another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes it's easier to separate variables in Cartesian. Let me think. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Wait, because (3/2)k r² (
