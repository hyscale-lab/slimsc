Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can give clues about the structure.

Triplets usually mean each proton is next to two others, like in a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group. Wait, no, wait. If a triplet is for 6H, maybe it's two sets of three, but wait, 6H as a triplet. Oh, wait! Maybe it's two equivalent -CH2-CH3 groups. Because each CH3 in an ethyl group has two adjacent protons. So each CH3 would be a triplet. And if there are two such groups, that would give 6H as a triplet. That makes sense.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to three others. So maybe a -CH2-CH2- group where each CH2 is next to the other. A quartet usually arises when a proton is split by a neighboring group with two protons. Wait, but 4H as a quartet. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a group like -CH2-CH2- where each of the four hydrogens are in a quartet. Wait, no, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- but that would be longer. No, wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2- group, but each of the two CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2. Wait, maybe the quartet comes from being next to another group with three protons? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2- group where each CH2 has two neighboring
