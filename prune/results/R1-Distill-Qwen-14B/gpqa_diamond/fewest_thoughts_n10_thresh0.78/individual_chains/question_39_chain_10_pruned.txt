Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function given. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, but in quantum mechanics, the wave function usually has real and imaginary parts. Oh, but wait, the square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. So I think I need to calculate this probability and normalize it because the total probability should be 1.

The problem states that when measuring the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, the given wave function is in a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the question explicitly says that the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i in the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3. So I don't have to worry about other regions for normalization because the wave function is zero outside, right?

But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So that's a complex function. But for a valid wave function, the integral of the absolute square must be 1. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1.

Let me write down the wave function properly. ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a complex number with real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part (-0.5). So ψ(x) = A + iB, where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is -0.5.

The absolute square is |ψ|² = A² + B². So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) squared is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5i) squared is (-0.5)^2 i², which is 0.25*(-1) but wait, wait! No, wait. The absolute square is A^2 + B^2 because the imaginary unit i is orthogonal. So |ψ|^2 is (a²/(1+x) )
