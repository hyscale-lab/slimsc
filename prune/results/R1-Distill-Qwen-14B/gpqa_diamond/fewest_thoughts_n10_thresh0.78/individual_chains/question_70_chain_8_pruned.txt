Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem describes a series of chemical reactions, and based on those, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. To figure this out, I think I need to backtrack through the reactions and identify what each compound is. Once I know what E is, I can determine its molecular structure and its symmetry.

Let me outline the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these compounds is.

Starting with the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and reacting in a 8:1 ratio, maybe B is something like O2, Cl2, or maybe SO3? Or perhaps a diatomic gas like O2? Let's think.

Wait, when metals react with diatomic gases, they often form compounds. For example, iron reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But 8 equivalents seem a lot. Maybe B is Cl2? Let's see. If A is Fe, reacting with Cl2, the product would be FeCl3. But wait, 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Fe (since each FeCl3 has 3 Cl). 4*2=8? No, wait, 4 moles of Cl2 would give 8 Cl atoms, so Fe + 4Cl2 → FeCl4? But I'm not sure if that's a common compound.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2. If A is a metal, say, sodium, but sodium oxide would form Na2O or Na2O2. But the reaction would need 8 O2 per Na. That seems unlikely. Or perhaps A is something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Red color in chemistry often suggests something like rust (Fe2O3·nH2O), but that's more of a reddish color. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with a red color like some transition metal compounds. Another thought: perhaps C is something like sulfur trioxide (SO3), but that's a gas. Or maybe it's a metal oxide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the third reaction says C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. If F is a strong acid and G is weak, that suggests two different acid products. So perhaps C is an anhydride, like a sulfonic anhydride or something else.

Wait, when a metal reacts with a diatomic gas, say, Cl2, and forms a compound that when reacted with water gives back the metal plus two acids. For example, say if C is FeCl4 (though I'm not sure if that's the case). When FeCl4 reacts with water, you get Fe(OH)3 and HCl. Wait
