Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking about the order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield for six different substances. Each of them undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. I think this means that each will substitute once, but directing groups will determine where the substitution happens.

The six substances are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (phenyl acetate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

I remember that in electrophilic substitution, substituents on the benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positionsâ€”ortho, meta, or para. 

Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1. CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group), so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So para would be a major product, but there's also ortho. But wait, sometimes bulky groups might favor para more because the ortho positions are closer and might have more steric hindrance. Methyl isn't too bulky, so I think para would be a major product, but maybe ortho is also significant.

2. COOEt (phenyl acetate): the acetate group is an electron-withdrawing group (since it's an ester). Ester groups are meta directing. So substitution would be more likely at the meta positions than the para. Wait, no, wait. Wait, esters are actually ortho/para directors but deactivating. Wait, no. Wait, wait, I might be mixing up. Let me think. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect, but the lone pairs on the oxygen can be electron-donating. Wait, no, the ester group is usually considered a deactivating (because the inductive effect dominates) and ortho/para directing. So substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para, but the ring is less reactive. So for phenyl acetate, the substituents at ortho and para.

3. Cl (chlorobenzene): chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to electronegativity) but it's an ortho/para director. Because despite being deactivating, the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance. So the Cl directs to ortho and para positions. But since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but that doesn't affect the position, just the reactivity.

4. NO2 (nitrobenzene): nitro is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. So, substitution occurs mainly at the meta position. So the para isomer would be less in this case.

5. C2H5 (ethylbenzene): ethyl is an activating group, like methyl. It's an alkyl group, so it donates electrons via the inductive effect. So it directs to ortho and para. But ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so steric hindrance might make para more favored than ortho. So the major product would be para, perhaps more than methyl because of the bulk.

6. COOH (benzoic acid): the carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta-directing group. So substitution occurs mainly at the meta position. So para isomer would be minor.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check each substituent:

- Methyl (toluene): activating, ortho/para. So both ortho and para are possible, but para might be more favored because of steric factors? Or maybe the para
