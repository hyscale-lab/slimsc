Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, sigmatropic rearrangements... I remember they involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions usually happen under thermal conditions and are pericyclic, so they involve concerted movement, right?

The problem has three reactions, and each one produces a product labeled A, B, or C. I need to figure out which option (A, B, C, D) correctly identifies all three products.

Let me go through each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A.

Wait, so the starting materials are an amine and an alcohol. But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. The other is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine, which is like an N,N-dimethoxyethylamine. Hmm, when you have an amine and an alcohol with heat and acid, maybe it's a condensation reaction? Or perhaps a Claisen-like rearrangement?

Wait, but the Claisen rearrangement typically involves an allyl vinyl ether rearranging to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But here, the starting materials have an amine. Wait, perhaps it's a variation of the Claisen or Cope rearrangement where the amine is part of the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic shift. Let me think. The 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has a structure like N(CH3O)2CH2CH2... Wait, no, 1,1-dimethoxy would be OMe groups on the same carbon. So it's CH2CH2N(OCH3)2? Wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Or maybe it's N,N-dimethoxyethylamine, but wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So structure is CH2(N(OCH3)2)CH3? Wait, no, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be at the first carbon, which is the same as the amine carbon. So it's (OCH3)2N-CH2CH3? Hmm.

But then, adding but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CHCH2OH, wait no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH2-OH with a double bond? Wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2 where the OH is on the second carbon and the double bond is between carbons
