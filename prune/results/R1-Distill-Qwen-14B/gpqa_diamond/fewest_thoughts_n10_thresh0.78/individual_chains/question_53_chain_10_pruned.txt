Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that means the benzene ring has two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have a carbonyl group, so that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can direct the protons in certain ways. The number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are meta to each other, there might be two sets of protons. Like, for example, if it's para-substituted, there would be two sets, but wait waitâ€”no, in para substitution, the ring has two equivalent protons. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, a para-substituted benzene would have two sets if the substituents are the same. But wait, no, if it's di-substituted and both substituents are the same, like two ester groups, then the ring would have symmetry. Or maybe they're different substituents. Hmm, the question doesn't specify if the substituents are same or different, but the aromatic protons give two signals. So aromatic ring has two distinct sets of H. That could be either para substitution (with two substituents in 1,4 positions), or maybe ortho, but that would lead to another pattern. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is in para and another in another position, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the di-substituted ring. Let's think about possible substitution patterns. For a 6-membered ring with two substituents, the positions could be para (1,4), meta (1,3), or ortho (1,2) if the substituents are in adjacent positions.

If the substituents are para, then the ring would have two equivalent H environments. Like, if each substituent is in 1 and 4 positions, then the ring would have two sets of protons: the ones ortho to substituents and the ones meta, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me draw this mentally. For example, if the substituents are both ester groups in para positions, the ring would have two types of H: those next to the substituents (ortho) and those opposite (para), but wait, in that case, maybe both ortho H are equivalent, and the same for the other positions. So the aromatic protons would split into two signals.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions (1,3), that would lead to more complex splitting. But the NMR shows two signals, so it's more likely para substitution because in para, the ring becomes symmetrical, leading to fewer signals. So two aromatic signals make sense for para substitution.

Then, the next part: two signals for vinyl-H. So vinyl protons would mean double bonds. There are two types here: one is a doublet, and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think about structures where vinyl protons would
