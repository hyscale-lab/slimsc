Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

So, the problem is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A to D, with numbers 16, 18, 22, and 12. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The setup is that we have a mixture X which is equimolar of two liquids, and this mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z, which is part of Y and is a solvent. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X's compounds.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually means it has some unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can react with bromine. So X must contain either an alkene or alkyne. But since it's an equimolar mixture of two liquids, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes or maybe one alkene and something else.

Next, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each component is undergoing a reaction? Or perhaps one of them is getting split into two different products. Hmm.

Wait, but the result is that Y is a mixture of two other liquids. So each of the two components in X might be transforming into different products. But it's a bit unclear.

So after the reaction, Y has two liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that Y has no double or triple bonds, as those would react with bromine. So perhaps Y consists of alkanes or other saturated compounds.

Then, when X and Y undergo hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions, only Z is formed. Z is a hydrocarbon, mass fraction of H is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28%, which is 1/7, since 14.28 is approximately 1/7 of 100%. So in Z, H contributes 1/7 of the total mass. Since in a hydrocarbon, the rest is carbon, which is 6/7.

The formula for mass fraction of H is (total H atoms * 1)/(total molar mass of Z) = 1/7.

Wait, let me think. For a hydrocarbon with formula CnHm, the molar mass is (12
