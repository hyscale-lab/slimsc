Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The problem describes an electron and a positron moving towards each other, colliding, and then annihilating into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some physics concepts. I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron have opposite charges, their collisions result in gamma-ray photons typically.

Wait, but in this case, they produce two photons. So, the conservation laws must apply here—conservation of energy and momentum. Since the problem states that both photons have the same energy, that's an important clue.

The setup: the electron is moving to the right (from left along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving to the left (from the right) with a Lorentz factor of 2. So, their speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is defined as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, higher gamma means higher velocity, closer to c. The electron's gamma is 4, which is higher than the positron's gamma of 2. So, the electron is moving faster than the positron.

Now, when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Let's think about the system before and after the collision.

The initial system consists of the electron and positron. Let's compute their total energy and momentum.

The electron's energy is gamma * m_e c². So, electron's energy: 4 * m_e c². Similarly, the positron's energy is 2 * m_e c². So, total initial energy is (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So m_e is correct for both.
