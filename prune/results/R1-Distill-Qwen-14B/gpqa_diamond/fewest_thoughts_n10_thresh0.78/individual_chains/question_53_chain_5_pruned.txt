Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down what I know and think through it. 

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues given are the IR and NMR spectra. 

First, the IR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm^-1. So, that tells me the compound has an ester functional group. 

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals. Let me break that down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern can affect the number of unique aromatic protons. Possible substitution patterns could be para, ortho, or meta. Wait, but wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. But the aromatic signals are two in total. Hmm. So maybe the substituents are in positions that make the aromatic protons split into two equivalent sets. Like, maybe para substitution where two sets of equivalent protons exist. For example, para substitution would have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon, but wait, no—para would have two equivalent protons each as two doublets or something? Or perhaps a meta substitution where there are two distinct groups. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with a substituent that makes the aromatic protons split into two sets. Alternatively, maybe it's a disubstituted benzene where the substituents are such that the ring has two equivalent protons and another two, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to only two types of aromatic Hs. Hmm, but wait, di-substituted benzene typically gives more than two signals. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are all equivalent. No, that's only in para substitution with identical substituents. Wait, but if the substituents are different, like one is an ester and another is something else, then the symmetry would be broken. So maybe the structure is such that the aromatic ring has two substituents leading to two sets of aromatic protons. 

Wait, but di-substituted benzene rings usually have either two (if para), three (ortho or meta), or more signals depending on substituents. If the substituents are para and identical, then you get two equivalent protons in two doublets. But if the substituents are different, like one is an ester and another is something else, then perhaps you get two different types of aromatic protons. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck on this point. Maybe I need to think more about the other signals.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting due to coupling. A doublet suggests each proton is coupled to one other. A doublet of quartets is more complex—could involve coupling with more than one neighboring proton. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester or something else. 

3. Two signals for –
