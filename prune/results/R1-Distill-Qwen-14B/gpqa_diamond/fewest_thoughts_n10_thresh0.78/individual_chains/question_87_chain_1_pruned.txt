Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I remember that the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum based on some given information.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, a di-substituted benzene ring would have six carbons already in the ring. So the substituents must contribute 2 more carbons, right? Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8 total. Or maybe one substituent is a group with more carbons? Hmm, but I think di-substituted here means two substituents each contributing, so maybe each substituent is one carbon. Or perhaps one substituent has two carbons and the other contributes none? Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. Because the IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, wait. Let's read the question again. The FTIR has peaks indicating a carbonyl group (like C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X, where X is a halogen like Cl, Br, etc.). So the aromatic ring has substituents: one is a carbonyl (maybe a ketone group, like a C=O attached to the ring) and another is a halogen. But wait, can a carbonyl group attach to the ring as a substituent? Like, for example, a ketone would require the ring to have a carbon attached to the carbonyl. But if it's a di-substituted benzene, the two substituents are on adjacent carbons, or para? Well, the positions might affect the NMR.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group (CH3CO-) or something similar. But wait, no, because the total number of carbons is 8. Let me think: benzene has six carbons. If the substituents are two groups, each with one carbon, that would make 8. So each substituent is a single carbon. So, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which would be a C=O attached to the ring) but that would only add one carbon
