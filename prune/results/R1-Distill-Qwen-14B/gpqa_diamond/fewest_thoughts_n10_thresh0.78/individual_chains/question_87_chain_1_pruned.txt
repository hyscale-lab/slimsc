Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, the compound is a 6-membered aromatic ring—so either benzene, but substituted. It's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached to the ring. The total carbons are 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. But wait, wait—no, wait, di-substituted could mean two substituents, each possibly contributing carbons.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So, the benzene ring is 6, plus substituents adding 2 more. So maybe each substituent is a single group, perhaps one substituent has two carbons and another is a halogen, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are two groups, each adding a certain number of carbons. Let me think: the ring is 6, substituents add 2. So perhaps each substituent is a single carbon group, or one substituent is two carbons and the other is a single non-carbon (like halogen, because IR shows aromatic-halogen bond).

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So one substituent is -CO-something. And another substituent is a halogen (since aromatic-halogen bond is present). So maybe the substituents are -CO-R and -X (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but the total carbon count is 8. So the ring is 6 carbons. The substituents add two carbons. Let's see: if one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, acyl, etc.), and the other is a halogen, maybe that's possible. Let's compute:

For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl like an acyl group (like -CO-), but wait, that might not add carbon. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group connected to another
