Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think this might be a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>. Like, each state has an equal probability, right? Because the coefficients are 1/2 each.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what exactly that refers to. Oh wait, I remember something about the Bloch sphere. Yes, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, while mixed states are inside.

But wait, how does that work for density matrices? I think for a single qubit, any density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (like coordinates in 3D space), right?

So let's break down the given ρ. Let me write out the matrix form to see. The |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiply by 1/2: so ρ is diag(1/2, 1/2).

Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute this. I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Multiplying by 1/2, it's [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

r·σ is the dot product of vector r with the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz.

Putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 should equal the given ρ, which is diag(1/2, 1/2). Let's compute (I + r·σ)/2:

The identity matrix part is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. The r·σ part is (r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1
