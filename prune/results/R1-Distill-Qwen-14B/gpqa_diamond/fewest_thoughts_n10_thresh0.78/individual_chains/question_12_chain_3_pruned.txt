Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, which is represented as Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are four different pairs of kinetic energies for the products. I need to pick the right one.

Wait, wait. So Pi is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the system's total momentum before decay is zero, the total after must also be zero. So the muon and neutrino's momenta must cancel each other. That's important.

Since Pi is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino must share this energy, but also their rest masses. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, but the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. So I can approximate the neutrino's energy as kinetic energy because its rest mass is almost zero.

The process is a decay, so conservation of energy and momentum applies. Let's think about energy first. The total energy before decay is the rest mass of Pi: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, E_nu = K_nu.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

But wait, because the neutrino is massless, its energy is related to its momentum by E_nu = |p_nu| c. Similarly, the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Because the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p_mu = -p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units are in MeV, so maybe I should handle the units properly. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, so energy and mass are in MeV, momentum in MeV/c, but with c=1, so p is in MeV/c, but when multiplied by c, it's MeV. Hmm, maybe it's better to use E = sqrt(p² + m²), where p is in MeV/c units, and E in MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations more clearly.

The energy conservation equation is:

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + E_nu.

But wait, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p * c. Since c=1 in these units, E_nu = p.

So,

m_pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Hmm, that's one equation with one unknown p. Let's plug in the numbers.

m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) + x.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2).

Now, square both sides:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side:

139.6² - 2*139.6*x + x² = x² + 105.7².

Simplify by subtracting x² from both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6 x = 105.7².

Compute the squares:

139.6^2 = (approx) let me calculate:

139.6 * 139.6:

Well, 140^2 is 19600, subtract (0.4)^2=0.16, and cross terms: 2*(140)*(
