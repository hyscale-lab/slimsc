Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which one gives the correct product in high yield.

First, let me sketch the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, benzene rings are numbered such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5? Let me confirm that. If the phenyl is attached to the ketone (C=O) at position 1, then the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So the ring would have nitro at 3 and bromo at 5? Wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Let me think: numbering starts from the ketone as position 1. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So the ring would have a nitro group at position 3 and bromo at position 5. Wait, wait, nitro is a strong meta director, and bromo is also a meta director. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The starting material is benzene. So the goal is to introduce substituents in the correct positions. Let's think about the possible steps. The target has a ketone group attached to the benzene ring (so that's a C=O group attached via a CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH2)CO, but as a ketone, it would be Ar-CO-CH3? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (R)C-O, but for 1-(phenyl)ethan-1-one, it's (Ph)C=O. So the structure is benzene ring attached to a carbonyl
