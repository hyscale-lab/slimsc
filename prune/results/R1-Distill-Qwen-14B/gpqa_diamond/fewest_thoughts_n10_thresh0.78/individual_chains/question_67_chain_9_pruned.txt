Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

Alright, the question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

Wait, the question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So we're measuring the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. Each Lz eigenvalue is -ħ for both particles.

Wait, I should remember that for a single particle, the eigenvalues of Lz are mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 because l=1.

The state we have is a coupled state |1,1,2,-1>. When you couple two angular momenta, the total state is a combination of all possible ways to get the total l and m. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think.

The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>, right? The condition is m1 + m2 = m. So in our case, m is -1. So m1 and m2 should add up to -1. Since each m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron.

So the possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to -1 are:

- m1=-1, m2=0 → sum is -1
- m1=0, m2=-1 → sum is -1

Wait, what about m1= -2 and m2=1? No, because each m can only be up to l=1 for each particle, so m1 and m2 can't be more than 1 or less than -1.

So only those two possibilities for m1 and m2 contribute to the |1,1,2,-1> state.

But wait, the coupled state |l1
