Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

Astronomers are comparing two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that when they looked at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, they were the same. Interesting. They also found the radial velocities: Star_1 is at 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity ratio when they assume the stars are black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember that luminosity for a star as a black body depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars are black bodies, their luminosities will be determined by L1 = 4πσ R1² T1⁴ and L2 = 4πσ R2² T2⁴. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴)/(R2² T2⁴).

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, that implies their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same, since λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, but wait! Unless they're moving towards or away from us, causing a Doppler shift. Oh, right, the radial velocity comes into play here. Because if a star is moving towards us or away, the observed wavelength shifts. So that might affect the observed peak wavelength.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. But the stars are moving. So the observed λ_max is the same because of their velocities.

Hold on, let's clarify. The peak emission wavelength for each star as per their rest frame would be λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2. But because Star_2 is moving with some velocity, its observed λ2_obs would be different.

Wait, the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, say λ_obs. So for Star_1, which has velocity 0, λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, its λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (1 + v/c), assuming it's moving away. Wait, but wait, the direction matters. If it's moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). If it's moving towards us, it's shorter (blueshifted),
