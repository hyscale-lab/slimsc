Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about the uncertainty in energy of an electron. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. I think it's related to the idea that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty.

The problem says the electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are given in terms of powers of ten, so maybe I can approximate the calculation.

Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. So from Δx, I can find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

But wait, how do I get from Δp to ΔE? Oh right, because energy is related to momentum. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. But since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps I can approximate ΔE using the same relationship. So ΔE would be approximately (2Δp²)/(2m), which simplifies to (Δp²)/m. Wait, not sure about that. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the uncertainty in energy is the derivative of energy with respect to momentum multiplied by the uncertainty in momentum.

Alternatively, since the energy is E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (dE/dp) * Δp. The derivative dE/dp is p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But wait, p is the momentum, but since we're dealing with uncertainties, maybe I should use the average momentum. Or perhaps I can just square the relative uncertainties. Maybe a better approach is to use the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle to find Δp and then compute ΔE based on that.

So first, let me compute Δp. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2. So Δp ≈ ℏ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers.

ℏ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. So:

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-10) = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-24 ≈ 0.527e-24 J·s/m. Wait, wait, let me compute that properly.

Wait, 0.1e-9 is 1e-10 m. So 2*Δx is 2e-10 m. So 1e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.27e-25 J·s/m. So Δp is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, the units. Let me think. ℏ is in J·s. Δx is in meters. So when you divide J·s by meters, you get (J·s)/m. Hmm, but J is kg·m²/s², so J·s/m is kg·m²/s² * s / m = kg·m/s. Because J = kg·m²/s², so J·s = kg·m²/s. Divide by m: (kg·m²/s) / m = kg·m/s. So yes, units of kg·m/s, which is the same as momentum. So that calculation makes sense.

So Δp ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, how do I get ΔE from this? I think I need to use the relation between momentum and energy. The kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy would be approximately the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by the uncertainty in p.

dE/dp = p/m, so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, wait, that's an approximation for small Δp. Alternatively, since E is a function of p, the uncertainty in E can be approximated using the uncertainty in p. So perhaps another approach is to compute the variance in E using the variance in p.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ΔE as (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E = p^2/(2m), so the variance in E would be ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m) ). So ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2/(2m).

Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because if E is p squared over 2m, then the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by the uncertainty in p. So dE/dp = p/(m), and so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But if I don't know p, maybe I can express it in terms of other variables. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate p from the given speed v.

Wait, the electron is moving at v = 2e8 m/s. So p = mv. Let me compute p.

The mass of the electron m is about 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So p = m*v = 9.10938e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.821876e-22 kg·m/s.

So p is approximately 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

Now, let's compute ΔE using the derivative approach. ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

p/m is (1.82e-22 kg·m/s) / (9.109e-31 kg) ) ≈ (1.82e-22)/(9.109e-31) s/m.

Let me compute that: 1.82e-22 /9.109e-31 = (1.82/9.109) * 1e9 ≈ 0.2 * 1e9 = 2e8 m/s.

Wait, that makes sense because p/(m) is velocity v, which is 2e8 m/s. Right, because p = mv, so p/m = v.

So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So now, Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

So ΔE ≈ 2e8 m/s * 5.27e-25 kg·m/s = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, that's approximately 1e-16 J. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 2e8 *5.27e-25 equals 2*5.27 * 1e8-25 = 10.54 * 1e-17 = 1.054e-16 J. So yes, around 1e-16 J.

Looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait, another approach: using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time? Because ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/2. But I don't know Δt. Alternatively, perhaps considering the time-energy uncertainty relation. But I think the approach I took is correct because I used the position-momentum uncertainty to find Δp, then used the momentum-energy relation to find ΔE.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to compute the kinetic energy based on the momentum uncertainty. Because the electron's momentum is p, and the uncertainty is Δp. So the relative uncertainty in p is Δp/p. Then, the relative uncertainty in E would be approximately 2*(Δp/p), because E is proportional to p squared. So (ΔE/E) ≈ 2*(Δp/p). Then, ΔE = E * 2*(Δp/p).

Wait, that sounds right. So let me compute E first.

E = (p²)/(2m) = ( (1.82e-22)^2 ) / (2 *9.109e-31 )

Calculate numerator: (1.82e-22)^2= approx (3.3e-45) kg² m²/s².

Denominator: 2 *9.109e-31 ≈ 1.82e-30 kg.

So E ≈ (3.3e-45) / (1.82e-30) = approx 1.81e-15 J.

Then, Δp/p is (5.27e-25)/(1.82e-22) )= approx 0.029 or 2.9% (since 5.27e-25 /1.82e-22 = 5.27/(1.82e3) = approx 2.9e-3).

So ΔE ≈ E * 2*(Δp/p) = 1.81e-15 J * 2 * 0.029 ≈ 1.81e-15 * 0.058 ≈ 1.05e-16 J. So again, around 1e-16 J.

So the same answer as before.

Thus, the correct option is D) ~1e-16 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and position uncertainty \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy.

### Step 1: Uncertainty in momentum (\( \Delta p \))
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta p \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]
Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 0.1 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relating momentum uncertainty to energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \))
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]
where \( m = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The momentum \( p \) can be calculated using \( p = mv \):
\[
p = m \cdot v = (9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}) \cdot (2 \times 10^8) = 1.82 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated using the derivative of \( E \) with respect to \( p \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{dE}{dp} \cdot \Delta p = \frac{p}{m} \cdot \Delta p.
\]
Substituting \( p = 1.82 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.82 \times 10^{-22}}{9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}} \cdot 5.27 \times 10^{-25}.
\]
First, calculate \( \frac{p}{m} \):
\[
\frac{p}{m} = \frac{1.82 \times 10^{-22}}{9.10938356 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]
Now, multiply by \( \Delta p \):
\[
\Delta E \approx (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
