Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So I guess the operator P itself is the vector operator, meaning P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z, right? Since n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), and since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. 

Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so maybe I should represent n in terms of spherical coordinates or something. Let me think. Oh, right, in spherical coordinates, any direction can be described by two angles, theta and phi. But since it's in the x-z plane, I think theta is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x would be sin(theta) cos(phi), but since the direction is arbitrary, perhaps phi can be chosen as zero without loss of generality because the problem is symmetric around the y-axis? Hmm, maybe not, but perhaps I'll just proceed with the general case.

Wait, the problem states that the direction is in the x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z) and n_x² + n_z² = 1. So the operator P along n is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because Py is zero here. 

So first, I need to construct the matrix for operator P. Let me write down the expressions for each component. 

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, substituting into P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

So P = (ħ/2) * [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let's compute that matrix:

The (1,1) element: n_z * 1
The (1,2) element: n_x * 1
The (2,1) element: n_x * 1
The (2,2) element: -n_z * 1

So P matrix is:
(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigen equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0.

So let's write P - (ħ/2) I:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z - 1, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ (n_z -1) , n_x ]
[ n_x      , (-n_z -1) ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the matrix is
