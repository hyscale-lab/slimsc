Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting 0 as the outcome for a given state of the system.

Alright, first, I need to recall what I know about observables and measurements in quantum mechanics. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. The probability of each outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's components when you express the state vector in the eigenbasis.

So, the state vector here is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think that might not be normalized yet. Oh wait, no, wait—the state is given, but I'm not sure if it's a unit vector. Let me check. The state is a column vector, let's call it |ψ>, which has components (-1, 2, 1). To find the probabilities, I probably need to normalize it first.

Wait, no, because the observable P's eigenvalues might not depend on the state's normalization, but the probabilities do. So, I need to normalize the state vector. To do that, I calculate the magnitude squared of each component and sum them up.

The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is 1/sqrt(6) times the original vector.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector, representing a probability amplitude. So if the given state isn't normalized, I definitely need to normalize it before proceeding.

So the state vector |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T, and its norm is sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Now, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down the matrix P.

P = [ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
       [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
       [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

Hmm, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. But wait, the question asks for the probability of getting 0. So I should find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize P and find the projection of the state |ψ> onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. The probability will be the sum of the squares of the projections.

Wait, but I'm not sure if P has 0 as an eigenvalue. Let me check the matrix P to see if 0 is an eigenvalue.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let's try that.

But solving the characteristic equation for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit time-consuming, but let's see.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So, let's compute the determinant of the matrix:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0          ]
[ 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ          ]

Hmm, the determinant of this matrix. Let me compute it.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

-λ * det( [ [-λ, 1/sqrt(2)], [1/sqrt(2), -λ] ] )
- (1/sqrt(2)) * det( [ [
