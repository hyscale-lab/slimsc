Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, wait. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of a Gaussian state. Oh, right, because Gaussian states are easier to handle, and for the relative entropy, if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But wait, what's the state here? The cat state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions can be non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, right?

So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. The reference Gaussian state tau would be the closest Gaussian state to rho, perhaps the one with the same first and second moments, but not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the reference is taken as a thermal state or a coherent state.

Wait, but the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So maybe the relative entropy is comparing the given state's entropy to that of the best Gaussian approximation. So if the state is Gaussian, then rho and tau would be the same, leading to zero non-Gaussianity.

But wait, when is the state |psi> Gaussian? Well, coherent states are Gaussian, but a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian except in some specific cases. Let me think about the given phi and alpha.

Given phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5. Let's compute sin(2phi). Because 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So the normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Wait, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/0.6275.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So |psi> becomes [0.7071 |0.5> -0.7071 |-0.5>]/0.6275.

Wait, but wait. The state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The superposition might lead to a non-Gaussian state.

But wait, what if in this specific case, the state becomes Gaussian? Oh, perhaps when the superposition leads to another Gaussian state. For example, if phi is 0, then the state is just |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, then it's | - alpha>, which is also Gaussian.

But for other phi, it's a superposition. So in this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2. So the state is a superposition of two coherent states with
