Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the quasar has a peak at about 790 nm and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, 790 nm is in the near infrared, right? But why is the flux dropping at shorter wavelengths? Oh, maybe it's related to redshift. Because when an object is moving away, the light is stretched to longer wavelengths, so emission lines might shift into the infrared from the optical. Or wait, maybe the peak is from a certain emission line, like hydrogen's Lyman-alpha? Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If it's now at 790 nm, that would mean a redshift.

Redshift z is calculated as (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) -1. So 790 / 121 ≈ 6.52. So z ≈ 5.52. Hmm, but wait, quasars are very bright and active, maybe this isn't Lyman-alpha. Or perhaps it's another line. Alternatively, maybe it's the peak of the blackbody spectrum, which for a quasar would be in the near-infrared if it's highly redshifted. Blackbody peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, the drop in flux below 790 nm could be due to the Lyman limit or something else. Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, but if the quasar's light is being redshifted, the observed wavelength would be longer. For instance, if the rest wavelength was, say, 91 nm (Lyman limit), observed at 790 nm, that's a redshift z = (790/91) -1 ≈ 7.68. That seems high. But quasars can have high redshifts. Maybe that's the case.

Wait, but the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance relates to how far away the quasar is, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance D_C is calculated using the integral of 1/(H(z)) dz from 0 to z. But wait, the question states that the universe is flat, with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_lambda = 0.7. So, we need to compute the comoving distance at redshift z.

But wait, the comoving distance for a quasar at redshift z is given by the formula:

D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(z')] dz'

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r * (1+z)^4 + Ω_m * (1+z)^3 + Ω_k * (1+z)^2 + Ω_lambda )

But since the universe is flat, Ω_r + Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the problem gives Ω_m = 0.3 and Ω_lambda = 0.7, so Ω_r (radiation) is negligible unless we
