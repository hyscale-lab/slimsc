Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when compounds have chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each of the given compounds to see if they have any chiral centers.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining different numbers.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings. So it's a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each carboxylate is a COOCH3 group. Wait, the rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So the positions 2 and 2' are on each ring, as well as 6 and 6'. Are there any chiral centers here? The central carbon in the biphenyl would be where the two rings are linked, but wait, that carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a COOCH3, and another group? Wait, no, the biphenyl is connected as 1,1' so each ring is connected at position 1, so the central carbon is part of the connecting bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each substituent is on the ring, so each carboxylate is on the 2 position of each ring, and nitro groups on 6. Are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

Wait, thinking about the dicarboxylate. Each COOCH3 is on the 2-position of each benzene ring. So for each methyl ester group, the carbon is attached to the oxygen of the ester, the two methyl groups (wait, no, the ester is OMe, so the carbonyl is attached to OMe. So the carbons where the substituents are attached are the ring carbons. Are any of those ring carbons connected to four different groups?

Wait, each benzene ring has substituents: at 2', perhaps. Maybe the rings are symmetrical? Like, if the substituents are arranged in a way that doesn't make any of the
