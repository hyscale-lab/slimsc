Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so just a bit above freezing point of water.

Also, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Furthermore, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I need to figure out what Substance X is.

Let me start by analyzing the possible reactions and products.

First, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W. The fact that W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons suggests that it's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each, so each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, but the molecule's composition would have a total of 16 (8 from each O atom). Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule as a whole. So, for example, O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the isotope ^16O). So O2 has 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So protons = neutrons. That fits.

So gas W could be O2. Then, the reaction of X and Y releases O2. What could that reaction be? One possibility is a decomposition reaction where X or Y is a peroxide, but let's think further.

Wait, another approach. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K (about 4°C). What's a compound that melts around there? Maybe water? Water melts at 273 K (0°C), but 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is an oxide, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a metal hydroxide, which upon heating releases water. Wait, but then B would be water, but water is a liquid, not a solid. Wait, maybe it's another substance. Alternatively, think of something else.

Let's consider the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction with release of gas, possibly an acid-base reaction. If Y is a liquid, maybe it's a strong acid, like sulfuric acid. So X could be a metal that reacts with acid, producing hydrogen gas. But wait, I thought W was O2. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach. The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which has a ketone group. Wait, no, actually, keto acids have a carboxylic acid group and a ketone group. For example, pyruvic acid. If X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a deprotonation or some kind of substitution.

Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, maybe the reaction is an acid-base reaction where X is a base. For example, X could be something like sodium bicarbonate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Substance X's analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, or maybe something like NaOH, but more likely the latter. Alternatively, maybe X is a halogen, but that's less likely.

Wait, another angle: The fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope suggests that perhaps it's a compound where one of the elements is a heavier isotope, like Cl-35 instead of Cl-37 or something else. Wait, but heavier isotope would be like Cl-37, but the question says "a heavier isotope", so perhaps the element in X has a higher atomic number isotope. For example, maybe Cl has a heavier isotope, but that's not what the question is about. Wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, say, X has two elements, one of which is present as a heavier isotope.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, if X is Cl2, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y to produce gas W, which is O2, precipitate G. So if Y is water, but then X would need to be something that reacts with water to produce O2. That could be a metal like sodium or potassium, but that would produce H2 gas, not O2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid like hydrogen peroxide. Because H2O2 is a liquid (under certain conditions), and if X is something that decomposes H2O2 into O2.

Wait, for example, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a catalyst for the decomposition of H2O2 into H2O and O2. But does MnO2 react with H2O2? Yes, but it's a catalytic reaction, not necessarily a violent reaction. So perhaps Y is H2O2, and X is MnO2. Then, the reaction would be H2O2 → H2O + O2. But the problem says that X reacts with Y to produce O2. So perhaps X is a catalyst in this case.

But then, the precipitate G would be... Wait, when H2O2 decomposes, it's just breaking down into water and O2, so perhaps G is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a different one.

Wait, perhaps Y is another acid. Let me think; if Y is a liquid, maybe sulfuric acid (H2SO4). If X is a metal or metal oxide, it might react with H2SO4 to produce a gas. For example, metals higher in the reactivity series than hydrogen would react to produce H2 gas. But the problem says the gas is O2, so that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide, like NaO2 or something? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B has a melting point of about 277 K, which is about 4°C, and that's under normal conditions. So, what's a solid that melts around there? Well, water is 273 K (0°C), so if B's melting point is close, maybe it's water. So when G is heated, it releases water. So G could be something like a hydrated salt, but upon heating, it loses water. Let me think: for example, if G is copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating would release water and form anhydrous copper sulfate. But the melting point of water is 273 K, so maybe B is water, but that would be a liquid. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. Another possibility is something like a metal, but metals usually have higher melting points. Wait, for instance, mercury has a melting point of about 270 K (−46°C), but that's lower than 277. Not sure.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think about the precipitate G. What if G is a carbonate? When heated, carbonates decompose into CO2 and the respective metal oxide. But the gas W is O2, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide, which upon heating loses water. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, but copper hydroxide doesn't decompose upon heating to form water, unless it's in a specific condition. Wait, heating copper hydroxide would typically decompose into copper oxide and water. Hmm, but that would mean B is water. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, going back to the reaction. The product of a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. So when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. That suggests that X adds two oxygen atoms to the keto acid. Or perhaps the reaction is an oxidation.

Wait, what's a keto acid? For example, pyruvic acid is a keto acid. It has a structure where there's a ketone group (C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). If X is something that can oxidize or add oxygen to the keto acid, perhaps it's an oxidizing agent.

If X is an oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a peracid. Wait, peracids are used in oxidation reactions. Alternatively, X could be something like KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, but earlier, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W, which is O2. So if X is a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4, and Y is a reducing agent, then they might produce O2.

Wait, KMnO4 is a dark solid, and when it reacts with something like H2SO4 (as a dilute acid), it can produce Mn^2+ and O2 gas. But that's a decomposition reaction under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide). Sodium peroxide reacts with water to produce O2. The reaction is: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, Y would be water, W is O2, and the precipitate would be NaOH. Wait, but sodium hydroxide is a strong base and would be a clear solution, not a precipitate. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another liquid, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but reacting with a peroxide might not produce O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hydrocarbon or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Let's think about this. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (CH3C(O)CH2COOH), which has two ketone groups? No, wait, acetoacetic acid is a beta-keto acid, so only one ketone group. So when it reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe X is an oxidizing agent, adding oxygen.

Wait, for example, if X is H2O2, which is a peroxide, acting as an oxidizing agent. But H2O2 is a liquid. But in the first part of the problem, X reacts with Y (another liquid) to produce O2. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, another thought: If the product of the keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's an esterification reaction. For example, if the keto acid reacts with an alcohol to form an ester. But that would require X to be an alcohol. But then, X would be an alcohol, which might not fit with the other parts of the problem.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration reaction, where X removes water, forming an ester. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. If a keto acid reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction, producing sodium salt, water, and CO2 maybe? But I'm not sure how that would result in a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is the conjugate base of the keto acid. For example, if the keto acid is RCOOH, reacting with a base like X (maybe NaOH) would produce RCOO^- Na^+ and water. But how would that have 2 oxygen atoms? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation where X adds two oxygen atoms to the keto acid. For example, oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. But wait, if the keto acid already has a ketone group, maybe it's being further oxidized. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible elements in Substance X. The question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So X has at least two different elements.

If X is sodium peroxide (Na2O2), then it's composed of Na and O. The lightest element would be Na (atomic mass ~23) and the heaviest is O (16). So sum would be 23+16=39, which is not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe X is something else.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the sum is 29, which is option D. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe X is something like H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). H2O2 has two H atoms and two O atoms. The lightest element is H (1) and the heaviest is O (16). So the sum would be 1 + 16 = 17, which isn't one of the options. But maybe X is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is KMnO4. K is about 39, Mn about 55, O is 16. The lightest is K (39?), no wait, K is heavier than Mn? Wait, no, Mn's atomic number is 25, so its atomic mass is about 55. K is 39. So the lightest element in KMnO4 is K or Mn? Wait, the elements are K, Mn, and O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). So sum is 16 +55=71, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with one heavier isotope. Wait, perhaps X is Cl2, but Cl can have isotopes like Cl-35 and Cl-37. But in that case, the lightest element is Cl and the heaviest is Cl as well (since it's the same element). So the sum would be 35 +37=72, not an option.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. So if B is water, then G must be a hydrate. So, maybe G is a hydrated salt, and upon heating, it loses water.

But if B is water, then G is a hydrate. So when G is heated, it loses water (H2O) and becomes an anhydrous salt. So, for example, if G is CuSO4·5H2O, heating would remove water, but the melting point of H2O is 273 K, which is just a bit lower than 277 K. So that fits.

So G is a hydrate, and upon heating, it releases H2O (B). Then, the gas W is O2. Hmm, but how does that tie into the reaction.

Wait, perhaps Y is H2O2. So X reacts with H2O2 (liquid Y) to produce O2 (gas W), and a precipitate G. Let's think of a reaction where a substance reacts with H2O2 to give O2 and a precipitate. For example, perhaps X is a metal, but that might produce H2 gas, not O2. Alternatively, perhaps X is a catalyst. But in that case, X wouldn't be consumed, so it wouldn't form a precipitate.

Wait, another possibility: X is MnO2, which is a catalyst in the decomposition of H2O2. So H2O2 decomposes to H2O and O2 in the presence of MnO2. But in this case, MnO2 is a solid, so it wouldn't form a precipitate because it's the catalyst and remains. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal oxide that reacts with H2O2. For example, perhaps a basic oxide. Let me think: perhaps X is a metal oxide that reacts with H2O2 to produce O2, some metal hydroxide, and water.

Wait, for example, suppose X is Fe3O4. When Fe3O4 reacts with H2O2, perhaps it forms Fe(OH)3 and O2. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CuO. CuO reacts with H2O2. Wait, I'm not certain about that reaction. Let me think: CuO is a solid, and when H2O2 is added, perhaps it acts as a catalyst for decomposition. But again, it wouldn't form a precipitate because it's already a solid.

Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me think again about the information given.

The product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So the product has two O atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has two O atoms in the functional groups. But wait, acetic acid has three O atoms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative. For example, if X is an alcohol, and the reaction is esterification. But then, the product would be an ester, which has more O atoms than the acid, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of the keto acid, forming a ketone. But that would remove an O, not add.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the reagents used in organic chemistry. One common reagent is KMnO4, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Another is NaOH, used in saponification, etc.

Wait, if X is KMnO4, then the reaction with Y (perhaps an acid) would produce O2. For example, in a strong acidic solution, KMnO4 decomposes to Mn^2+ and O2. The reaction is something like 2 KMnO4 + 16 H2SO4 → 2 MnSO4 + K2SO4 + 8 H2O + 5 O2↑. So that would fit, where Y is H2SO4 (liquid), X is KMnO4. Then, the precipitate G would be MnSO4·H2O perhaps? Or maybe the solution is colored due to Mn^2+ ions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a precipitate of some other compound.

Wait, but in this reaction, KMnO4 is the oxidizing agent. So when it reacts with H2SO4 (concentrated), it produces MnSO4, K2SO4, O2, and water. So perhaps the precipitate G is actually something else, maybe MnO2? No, because in this case, Mn is in +2 oxidation state.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another liquid, like glycerol, which when reacted with KMnO4 produces O2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate G is due to the formation of a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal, which reacts with liquid Y (an acid) to produce O2, but that would imply a metal that reacts with an acid to produce O2, which is unusual. Most metals produce H2 gas when reacting with acids.

Wait, unless the acid is a strong oxidizing acid like H2SO4, which can oxidize some metals to produce O2. For example, in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, metals like copper might react, but typically they produce SO2, not O2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think of the product involving two oxygen atoms. Maybe X is an oxygen-containing compound, like O2 itself, but that's a diatomic gas.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH), which has three O atoms. If X is a base like NaOH, the product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid, which would have more O atoms, so that's not fitting.

Alternatively, if X is H2O2, and the reaction is an oxidation, perhaps the product has two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is oxidized to a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The product has two O atoms, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. If X is a reagent that converts the keto acid into an ester, but that would require an alcohol, which I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is H2SO4, which is used to dehydrate carboxylic acids into anhydrides, but that would require the acid to lose water, leading to a molecule with fewer O atoms. Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydration of the keto acid to form a ketone. But that would remove an O, leaving the product with one less O than the acid. So if the acid has three O's, the product would have two O's. That fits!

So, the keto acid has three O's, and the product has two. So the reaction is a dehydration. So X must be a dehydrating agent, like H2SO4. So X is H2SO4?

But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, and when it reacts with a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid), it would dehydrate it by removing a water molecule, forming an anhydride or a ketone. For example, pyruvic acid can be dehydrated to form acrolein (which has a double bond). But the product's formula would have two O's. Let me check: pyruvic acid is C3H4O3. If it loses a water molecule (H2O), it would form C3H2O2. So the product would have two O atoms. That fits.

So X is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), which is a common dehydrating agent used in organic chemistry. So, X is H2SO4.

Now, let's go back to the first part of the question. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently to produce gas W (O2), and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K.

If X is H2SO4, what could Y be? Let's think about reactions of H2SO4. One possibility is that Y is a metal, but metals reacting with H2SO4 typically produce SO2 gas, not O2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with H2SO4 would produce CO2, water, and sodium sulfate. But that doesn't produce O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. Reacting H2SO4 with a sulfide could produce SO2, but again, not O2.

Wait, another possibility: maybe Y is a reducing agent. For example, if Y is a liquid like glycerol, and X is H2SO4, they can form a mixture that upon heating produces O2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a peroxide, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base that reacts with H2SO4 to produce a salt, water, and O2. But I'm not sure what base would do that.

Wait, another idea: Maybe Y is a metal oxide. For example, if X is H2SO4 and Y is a metal oxide that reacts with it, but that would typically form a sulfate and water, not O2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think differently. If X is H2SO4, and Y is a liquid that reacts to produce O2, perhaps Y is a peroxide, like H2O2. So the reaction would be H2SO4 + H2O2 → ?

But what reaction would that produce O2? Perhaps a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, maybe H2SO4 in presence of a catalyst (like MnO2) could decompose H2O2 into O2, but then X would be the catalyst, not a reactant.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal, but as I thought before, that produces SO2, not O2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed. If X is H2SO4 and Y is a carbonate or bicarbonate, the precipitate could be a sulfate salt. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid would produce sodium sulfate, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Unless Y is a less soluble carbonate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfide. For example, if Y is FeS, reacting with H2SO4 would produce FeSO4, which is soluble, so perhaps no precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps G is a metal sulfate that isn't very soluble. For example, if Y is Ba(OH)2, a strong base, reacting with H2SO4 would produce BaSO4 precipitate, which is a white solid. Then, when BaSO4 is heated, does it do anything? Well, BaSO4 is a stable solid and doesn't decompose upon heating, so that doesn't fit because B would need to be released upon heating.

Wait, but the problem says that when G is heated, B is released. If G is BaSO4, heating it doesn't release any gas. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: If Y is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with H2SO4 produces Na2SO4, CO2, and H2O. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Unless Y is a carbonate of a metal whose sulfate is insoluble. For example, CaCO3: CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 (which is slightly soluble) + CO2 + H2O. If CaSO4 is a precipitate, then G would be CaSO4. When heated, CaSO4 doesn't decompose, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a sulfite, which when reacted with H2SO4 would produce SO2 instead of O2, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the possibilities again.

If X is H2SO4, and it reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce O2, maybe Y is a liquid that can act as a reducing agent, causing H2SO4 to act as an oxidizing agent, producing O2. For example, maybe Y is a sugar or some organic compound that reacts exothermically with H2SO4, producing O2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal with a high oxidation state. For example, if Y is a solution containing MnO2, which could catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to produce O2. But then, H2SO4 isn't part of that reaction.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about X being H2SO4. Let me think of another possibility.

Another reagent in organic chemistry is NaOH. Suppose X is NaOH. Then, what would happen when NaOH reacts with a liquid Y? Let's think. If Y is a carboxylic acid, they would neutralize to form a salt and water. But that wouldn't produce O2.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an ester. Reacting with NaOH (saponification) would produce a carboxylate salt and an alcohol. But again, no O2 produced.

Wait, but the product of the reaction between X (NaOH) and a keto acid would be the conjugate base. That would have the same number of O atoms as the acid, so that doesn't fit the two O atoms condition.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a different X.

Wait, another common reagent is HNO3 (nitric acid), but that's more of an oxidizing agent. Let's see: If X is HNO3, then reacting with Y could produce O2 if Y is a strong reducing agent. For example, metals like copper in concentrated HNO3 produce NO3− and NO2, not O2.

Wait, perhaps Y is a peroxide, but that's a stretch.

Another angle: If X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, which is a strong oxidizing agent. When Na2O2 reacts with water (Y is H2O), it produces O2, NaOH, and H2O. So the reaction is 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So in this case, X is Na2O2, Y is H2O. The gas W is O2, which fits the earlier condition.

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble in water, so that wouldn't form a precipitate. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, unless Y is something else. Maybe Y is an acid that reacts with Na2O2 to produce O2 and a precipitate. For example, if Y is H2SO4, but that's a strong acid and would react with Na2O2 to produce O2 and possibly a sulfate salt.

But Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2. Wait, but H2O2 is a liquid, not a precipitate. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol, which when reacts with Na2O2 produces O2 and a metal alkoxide, which is soluble, not a precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is something else. Let me think: If Y is a liquid carbonate, such as carbonated drinks. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If B has a melting point near 277 K, which is about 4°C, perhaps B is a solid like ice. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps B is a substance that melts at that temperature, like some organic compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the possible elements in X.

If X is Na2O2, its elements are Na and O. The lightest element is Na (atomic mass ~23) and the heaviest is O (16). So sum is 23+16=39, which isn't an option. So perhaps X isn't Na2O2.

If X is H2O2, the elements are H and O. The sum is 1 +16=17, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), but I'm not sure. Cl has an atomic mass around 35.5, O is 16. So the sum would be 35.5 +16=51.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with two different elements, like NaOH. Na (~23), O (16), H (1). The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: The problem says to consider the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So X might have more than two elements. For example, KMnO4 has K, Mn, O. The lightest is K (39?), wait, no, the elements are K (~39), Mn (~55), O (~16). So lightest is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 71, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid, and the question says X is a reagent in organic chemistry. But the product of acetic acid (a keto acid?) reacting with X would be something else. Wait, but acetic acid is not a keto acid. A keto acid has a ketone group along with a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, another possibility: X is a halogen, like chlorine. Chlorine is a diatomic gas, but in this problem, X is a substance that reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce O2. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is O3 (ozone). But ozone is a gas, not a solid or liquid.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce O2 gas and precipitate G. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B with a melting point near 277 K.

Suppose the reaction is between X and Y, producing O2, and a metal hydroxide as precipitate. For example, if X is a metal and Y is water, but that would produce H2 gas, not O2.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, and Y is a metal. For example, X is Na2O2, Y is H2O, and the reaction produces O2. But then, the precipitate would be NaOH, which is soluble.

Hmm, perhaps I should give up and think about the possible answers. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, if X is KMnO4, the elements are K (39), Mn (55), O (16). So the lightest is O (16), heaviest is Mn (55). Sum is 71, not an option.

If X is H2O2, sum is 1 +16=17, not an option.

If X is NaOH, elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two different elements, one light and one heavy. For example, X could be a diatomic molecule like O2, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements whose atomic masses add up to one of the options.

Looking at the options: 35, 25, 31, 29.

35: Could be Cl (35.5) and something else. But if X is Cl2, the sum is 71, not 35. Wait, but the sum of the lightest and heaviest. Wait, if X has two elements, one light and one heavy, the sum would be their individual atomic masses.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with elements H and Cl. For example, HCl. H is 1, Cl is 35.5. So sum is 36.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, X could be a compound with O and Cl: ClO2. Cl is ~35.5, O is ~16. So the sum is 51.5, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is a mixture of isotopes, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: X is a compound with elements like C and O. But C (12) and O (16) sum to 28, which is close to option 29, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2. Then, elements are C and O. So sum is 12 +16=28, which is close to option D (29). But the options don't have 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like CHO (but that's not a stable compound), but the sum would be 12 +16 +1=29. So that's 29, which is option D.

Wait, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, like acetone (propanone), which is (CH3)2CO. Then, the elements are C and O. Sum is 12 +16=28, but again, option D is 29.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. For example, a molecule like ethanol (C2H5OH). The elements are C, H, and O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is C (12). Sum is 13, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with elements like F and O. For example, OOF. Fluorine's atomic mass is ~19, O is 16. So sum is 35, which is option A. But I'm not sure if such a molecule exists.

Alternatively, if X is a compound with F and O, like O2F2 (difluorine dioxide), which is a highly reactive compound. The elements are O and F. O is 16, F is 19. So sum is 35, which is option A.

Hmm, that might fit. So X is O2F2. Then, when it reacts with a liquid Y (perhaps water), it might produce O2 gas. Wait, O2F2 reacts with water to produce O2, HF, and O2F2·H2O. But I'm not certain about the reaction.

In this case, the lightest element is F (19), heaviest is O (16)? No, wait, F is heavier than O. So the heaviest is F (19), lightest is O (16). Sum is 35, which would be option A.

But I'm not sure if O2F2 is a common reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like S and O. Sulfur has an atomic mass of ~32, O is 16. Sum is 48, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound with elements Na and Cl. For example, NaCl. The sum would be 23 +35.5=58.5, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with K and O. K is ~39, O is 16. Sum is 55, not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think back to the problem statement.

The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. If X is a dehydrating agent, like H2SO4, then when a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid) reacts with H2SO4, it loses a water molecule, forming a ketone with two O atoms.

So, in that case, X is H2SO4. Then, in the first reaction, X (H2SO4) reacts with Y (perhaps a carbonate) to produce O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, but that would produce SO2, not O2.

Wait, maybe Y is a peroxide, like H2O2. Then, H2SO4 and H2O2 could react to produce O2. For example, H2SO4 could act as an acid catalyst for the decomposition of H2O2. The reaction would be:

H2O2 → H2O + O2↑

But in this case, H2SO4 is just a catalyst, not a reactant. So the reaction wouldn't produce any precipitate, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2O2, and Y is something else. But I'm not certain.

At this point, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The options given are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is H2O2, the sum is 1+16=17, not an option.

If X is KMnO4, sum is 16+55=71, not an option.

If X is Na2O2, sum is 23+16=39, not an option.

If X is ClO2, sum is 35.5 +16=51.5, not an option.

If X is O2F2, sum is 16 +19=35, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if O2F2 is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Alternatively, perhaps X is another compound.

Wait, another thought: If X is a peracid, like H2O2 (already considered), or another peracid like mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid). But mCPBA is an organic compound, and its elements would include Cl, O, and C. The lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 47.5, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide with heavier elements. Wait, perhaps X is PbO2. Lead has an atomic mass around 207, O is 16. Sum is 223, way above the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Based on the information, the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must be one of the options provided. Considering the options, 29 (option D) is a possibility. How could that happen?

If X contains elements with atomic masses adding to 29. Let's see: 29 could be 12 (C) + 17 (Cl? No, Cl is 35.5). Alternatively, 15 (N) + 14 (C) =29. Or 16 (O) + 13 (Al) = 29. Hmm.

Wait, if X is Al(OH)3, then elements are Al (27), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 28, which is close to option D (29). But again, not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule containing O and Cl, but I can't think of a common one.

Wait, perhaps X is HClO (hypochlorous acid). Then, elements are H (1), Cl (35.5), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'll have to go with option D) 29, based on the information that X is a reagent in organic chemistry and the product of the reaction with a keto acid having two O atoms. Maybe X is something like NaOH, which has elements Na, O, H. But sum is 23 +16 +1=40, no. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, another thought: The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of the elements in X is a heavier isotope, but for the purpose of calculating the cumulative atomic masses, we consider the lightest and heaviest elements in X, regardless of their isotopes.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule that has two different isotopes of the same element. For example, Cl2 can have Cl-35 and Cl-37. But in this case, both are the same element, so the sum would not involve two different elements.

Wait, no, the question is about the lightest and heaviest elements within X. So if X is a compound with multiple elements, we need to find the lightest and heaviest among them and sum their atomic masses.

If X is H2O2, the elements are H and O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

If X is Na2O2, elements are Na and O. Sum is 23 +16=39, still not an option.

If X is something like CCl2F2, elements are C, Cl, F. Lightest is C (12), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is 47.5, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with elements like O and S. Sulfur's atomic mass is ~32. So sum would be 16 +32=48, not an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The melting point of B is close to 277 K. If B is H2O, which melts at 273 K, then B is water. So when G is heated, it releases water. So perhaps G is a hydrate.

So when X reacts with Y, it forms a hydrate precipitate G. Upon heating, G loses water (B) and becomes an anhydrous salt.

So, for example, if Y is a salt solution, and X is a base that reacts to form a hydrate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal sulfate, and X is a base that precipitates a hydroxide, which is a hydrate.

Wait, perhaps X is NaOH. Reaction with Y (a metal sulfate solution) would produce a precipitate of the metal hydroxide, which is a hydrate.

For example, NaOH + CuSO4 → Cu(OH)2 (precipitate) + Na2SO4.

Cu(OH)2 is a blue precipitate. Heating Cu(OH)2 would decompose it into CuO and water. So B would be water, which has a melting point of 273 K. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, so this fits.

So in this scenario, X is NaOH. Then, the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X would be the conjugate base. For example, if the keto acid is acetic acid, the product would be the acetate ion, which has two oxygen atoms (in the COO^- group). So that fits the condition.

So X is NaOH.

Now, the elements in NaOH are Na, O, and H. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). So the sum is 24, which isn't an option. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe X is another hydroxide, like KOH. Then, elements are K (39), O (16), H (1). Sum is 39 +16=55, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is a different base. Let me think.

If X is Ca(OH)2, then elements are Ca (40), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Ca (40). Sum is 41, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Mg(OH)2. Then, elements are Mg (24), O (16), H (1). Sum is 24 +16=40, not an option.

Wait, another approach: The problem says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So if X has multiple elements, sum the lightest and heaviest.

If X is H2O2, sum is 1 +16=17, not an option.

If X is Na2O2, sum is 23 +16=39, not an option.

If X is H2O, sum is 1 +16=17.

Hmm, none match.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that's a gas, and sum is 16 +16=32, which is option C (31). Close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps X is O3. Sum is 16 +16=32, same as above.

But the options are 35,25,31,29.

Another thought: If X is a compound with elements like Cl and O. For example, ClO2. Cl (35.5) and O (16). Sum is 51.5, not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, if X is FeO, then Fe (56) and O (16). Sum is 72, not an option.

Hmm, maybe X is a carbon-oxygen compound like CO. Then, C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28, close to option D (29). But not exact.

Wait, perhaps X is CO2. Then, C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28, same as before.

But none of these sums match the options exactly.

I'm starting to think that maybe I'm missing something in the initial analysis. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, producing O2 gas and precipitate G.
- G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (water is 273 K, so close).
- Product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms.
- X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Based on the last point, X is likely an inorganic reagent used in organic reactions, such as H2SO4, NaOH, KMnO4, etc.

If X is H2SO4:

- Reacts with Y (maybe a carbonate) → O2, G (precipitate)
- G is a sulfate, which upon heating doesn't release a gas. So this may not fit.

If X is NaOH:

- Reacts with Y (a metal sulfate solution) → precipitate of metal hydroxide (G)
- Heating G (metal hydroxide) → metal oxide + H2O (B)
- B is H2O, melting point 273 K, which is close to 277 K.
- Product with keto acid is conjugate base, which has two O atoms.

Now, X is NaOH. Elements: Na (23), O (16), H (1). So sum of lightest (H) and heaviest (Na) is 24. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try another angle.

The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like CH3COCOOH (pyruvic acid), which has three O atoms. If X is an oxidizing agent that converts the acid into a compound with two O atoms, perhaps by removing one O. For example, oxidizing the ketone group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent, but that would add H and remove O.

Wait, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, removing a water molecule. So the product would have two O atoms.

If the keto acid is CH3COCOOH (pyruvic acid, three O), losing a water molecule would give CH3COCH2 (which is not possible because it would require breaking the structure), so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like P2O5, which is a dehydrating agent. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: If X is H2O2, which is a peroxide and can act as an oxidizing agent. So when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it adds an O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, removing a water molecule and leaving two O atoms. So X is H2SO4.

Anyway, considering the time I've spent, I'll have to make a best guess. The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is likely 29 (option D). How? If X contains elements with atomic masses adding up to 29. For example, C (12) and O (16) sum to 28, which is close to 29.

Wait, another possibility: If X is a molecule with C and F. Fluorine has an atomic mass of ~19, C is 12. 12+19=31, which is option C.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like N and O. N is 14, O is 16. Sum is 30, close to option C (31). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule like NO, which has N (14) and O (16). Sum is 30, close to option C (31).

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with option D) 29 as the answer.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which reacts with a liquid Y to produce gas W (O₂), a precipitate G, and a product B with a melting point near 277 K. Additionally, the product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction with Y and Gas W (O₂):**
   - X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce O₂ gas. This suggests X could be a peroxide (e.g., H₂O₂ or Na₂O₂) or a strong oxidizing agent like H₂SO₄, which can decompose to release O₂.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B:**
   - G is a precipitate that forms during the reaction. When heated, G releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K (close to water's melting point at 273 K). This implies B is likely water (H₂O), and G could be a hydrated salt that loses water upon heating.

3. **Reaction with a Keto Acid:**
   - The product of X and a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X could act as a dehydrating agent, removing water from the keto acid to form a product with fewer oxygen atoms.

4. **Relevance to Organic Chemistry:**
   - X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include H₂SO₄ (a dehydrating agent), NaOH (a base), or KMnO₄ (an oxidizing agent).

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses of Lightest and Heaviest Elements in X:**
   - The problem requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example:
     - If X is H₂SO₄, the elements are H (1), S (32), and O (16). The lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is S (32). Their sum is 33, which is not an option.
     - If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), and H (1). The lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). Their sum is 24, which is also not an option.
     - If X is H₂O₂, the elements are H (1) and O (16). The lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is O (16). Their sum is 17, which is not an option.

6. **Final Consideration:**
   - Based on the options provided (35, 25, 31, 29), the most plausible answer is **29**. This could correspond to a compound like CO (C: 12, O: 16), where the sum of the lightest (C) and heaviest (O) elements is 28, close to 29. While not a perfect match, this is the best fit among the given options.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are most consistent with **29**.
