Okay, so I have this question about isomers and some specific compounds. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out each one to pick the correct option.

First, part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione?

Wait, what's tautomerism? I remember that tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a bond (usually a double bond) between two adjacent atoms, leading to different structures but the same molecular formula. Like in keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the compound must have a structure that allows for such a shift. So, for example, if there's a carbonyl group adjacent to a hydroxyl group or something similar, it can lead to tautomerism.

Looking at the two compounds given for part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups, right? Wait, no, quinones are cyclic with two ketones. Benzoquinone would have a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to carbons in the ring. So it's O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, benzoquinone can have two double bonds, but in either para or ortho positions. But regardless, the structure has two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each at positions 1,3,5. So it's a ring with three O's attached via double bonds, spaced every other carbon.

Now, do either of these have the possibility for tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can move. Like in something with an alpha hydrogen. For example, in a diketone, if the carbonyls are adjacent, but in these cases, I'm not sure.

Wait, benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Do they have adjacent hydrogens? If it's para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other, so perhaps no adjacent hydrogens. Because each carbonyl is on a carbon that's
