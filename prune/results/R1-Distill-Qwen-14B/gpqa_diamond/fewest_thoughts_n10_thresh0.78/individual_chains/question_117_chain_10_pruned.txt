Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** Wait, biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. But wait, if the substituents are symmetric, does that cause any chiral centers? Or maybe the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. Hmm, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate groups. Let me visualize: on each phenyl ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has two groups, 2 and 6. Oh wait, phenyl rings are symmetric, so maybe each ring's substituents are in positions that mirror each other. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the biphenyl structure could have axial chirality. Oh right! Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes them non-superimposable. So if the substituents are not symmetrical, the biphenyl can have E and Z configurations, leading to enantiomers. In this case, the substituents are 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate on each ring. Are these positions on adjacent carbons or opposite? Wait, the numbering is 6 on one and 2 on the other. Wait, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but across the biphenyl linkage. So the arrangement would lead to whether the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). If they are on the same side, then the molecule could be chiral. But wait, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? Let me think: if the two substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Oh wait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent if you're considering the ring as a hexagon. Or wait, no. Let me correct: on a benzene ring, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 6 are across from each other, but that depends on how the rings are connected. Wait, the biphenyl is 1,1', so each ring is connected at the 1 position. So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ringâ€”so each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me imagine this: each phenyl has two substituents opposite each other, but when connected at 1 and 1', the overall structure may have a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, if the substituents are symmetrically arranged, perhaps the molecule is achiral. But wait, each substituent on each ring is a nitro and a carboxylate, which are different. So on each ring, 2 is a COOCH3 and 6 is a NO2 group. Wait, no, the formula says 6,6'-dinitro, so both rings have a nitro at 6. And 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6. But on the other ring, same. So each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. Wait, but the biphenyl is connected at 1,1'. So for each
