Okay, so I have to figure out how many of these compounds exhibit optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound has chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2CH3? Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl). So the molecule is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. That makes the structure Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (with a methyl), and then C3 and C4 as CH2 and CH3? Not sure, but regardless, the point is whether it's chiral. For a molecule to be chiral, it needs to have a chiral center. But in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the Cl is on C1, which is a double bond. So C1 is connected to Cl, double bond to C2, and two other substituents (probably CH(CH3) and something else?). Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the groups on C1 would be Cl, double bond to C2, and two CH2 groups? Or maybe one CH2 and another CH(CH3)? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl on C1, which is connected to a double bond (so C1 is CH
