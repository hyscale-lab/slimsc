Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about particles being collided in a detector. These particles are new types, and they travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls instead.

Hmm, so I need to find the Lorentz gamma that allows two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls. I remember that the Lorentz factor affects the lifetime of particles from our perspective because of time dilation. Oh right, because particles moving at relativistic speeds experience less time (from our frame) because of gamma.

Wait, so the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is such that in their own frame, they decay quickly, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to gamma. So the distance they can travel before decaying is their speed multiplied by their lifetime in the lab frame.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector. They travel in all directions, but the ones that reach the inner walls are the ones that make it to 30 meters before decaying. So the time they have is the time it takes for them to reach the detector's radius, which is 30 meters.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because the particles are moving at a certain speed, which is determined by their Lorentz factor. The speed is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gammaÂ²), right? So for gamma much larger than 1, v is approximately c.

But the key here is the relation between the proper lifetime (tau) and the dilated lifetime (gamma tau). The particles' lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So the maximum distance they can travel is v multiplied by gamma tau.

But wait, the decay process is probabilistic. The decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle does not decay in a time t is exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau. So the probability of not decaying before traveling a distance L is exp(-L/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, but another way to think about it:
