Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a potential. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level.

First, the potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So this is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. Isotropic means it's the same in all directions, so radial symmetry.

In the three-dimensional case, we can consider the oscillator in each direction and then sum up the energies. Or maybe use the quantum numbers in spherical coordinates. Wait, I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). But wait, another approach is to express it in terms of the total quantum number. Oh, right, in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the sum of the principal quantum numbers. Hmm, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the radial and angular parts.

Wait, no. The energy levels for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be determined by the quantum numbers in each direction. Or it can be expressed in terms of the total number of quanta. Let me recall: the energy levels are equally spaced with spacing ħω. Each energy level is (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Oh wait, no, not exactly. Let me get this right.

Wait, I think the energy formula is E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers, each being non-negative integers. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each n_x, n_y, n_z is 0,1,2, etc. So each n corresponds to a specific energy level.

Wait, no, maybe it's n = (n_r + l), where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. Hmm, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels that are given by E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = 2n_r + l. So n_r is the radial quantum number, and l is the angular momentum quantum number (0,1,2,...). So each energy level depends on n, which is the sum of 2n_r and l. But wait, how does this fit with the quantum numbers?

Wait, another approach: the energy levels for an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator can be written as E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Each n_x, n_y, n_z is 0,1,2,... So the total n is n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: the energy levels are degenerate, and each level corresponds to a certain (n_x + n_y + n_z), which gives the same energy for all combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to the same value. So the energy for each state is E = (n + 3/2) ħω where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but the ground state would be when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so n =0, E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited states would be when one of the n's is 1, so n=1, E= (5/2) ħω. Then next, when two are 1 and one is 0, or when one is 2 and others are 0. Wait, no. Wait, for each n, the possible combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that sum to n.

So n can be 0,1,2,3... and each n gives a certain energy. Each energy level has a degeneracy, which is the number of distinct ways to write n as n_x +n_y +n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer.

So for example, n=0: only (0,0,0), so degeneracy 1.

n=1: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) → 3 states.

n=2: (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) → total 6 states.

n=3: How many? Let's think: the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n. The formula is (n+2 choose 2) which for n=3 is (5)(4)/2=10. So degeneracy is 10.

Wait, so the third excited state. Wait, what's the order of the states?

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0, E=(3/2) ħω.

First excited state would be n=1, E=(5/2) ħω.

Second excited state is n=2, E=(7/2) ħω.

Third excited state is n=3, E=(9/2) ħω.

So the energy of the third excited state is (9/2) ħω.

Then, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue is the degeneracy, which for n=3 is 10.

So looking at the options:

Option A says energy (9/2) ħω, 10 eigenfunctions. That matches.

Option C has 3 eigenfunctions, which would be wrong because it's n=1.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \hbar \omega \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of distinct ways to write $n$ as the sum of $n_x + n_y + n_z$.

- The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, with energy $E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$ and degeneracy 1.
- The first excited state corresponds to $n = 1$, with energy $E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$ and degeneracy 3.
- The second excited state corresponds to $n = 2$, with energy $E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$ and degeneracy 6.
- The third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$, with energy $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and degeneracy 10.

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy eigenvalue is 10.

From the given options:
- Option A correctly states the energy as $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy as 10.
- The other options either provide incorrect energy values or degeneracies.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
