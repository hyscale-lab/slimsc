Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I remember, pericyclic reactions involve the concerted movement of electrons, like in cycloadditions or sigmatropic shifts. Sigmatropic rearrangements involve a pi bond migrating along with a sigma bond. Examples include the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the given options.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

**Problem 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A**

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. I'm thinking about what kind of reaction this could be. Since it's a sigmatropic rearrangement, maybe a Claisen or Cope, but those are usually for enol ethers or 1,5-dienes. Wait, but one of the reactants is an amine. Maybe it's a different kind of rearrangement.

Wait, the first reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's a molecule where ethanamine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon. The structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But wait, ethanamine is CH3NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would be (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Or maybe it's more like HOCH2CH2NH2, but with methoxy groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

No, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be NH2-C(OCH3)2. So the amine is attached to a carbon that's connected to two methoxy groups. So the structure is (OCH3)2CHNH2. But wait, ethanamine
