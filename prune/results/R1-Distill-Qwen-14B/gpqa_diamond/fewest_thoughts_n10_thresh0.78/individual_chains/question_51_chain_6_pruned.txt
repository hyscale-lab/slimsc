Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, Dâ€”each with different formulas involving k, q squared, d, and R squared or something.

First, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics can be tricky because it's a system property. So when you bring charges together, the work done relates to the potential energy change.

Wait, the sphere is grounded. Oh right, that means it's connected to the Earth, so it can have charges flow in or out. For a conducting sphere, the charges will reside on the surface, right? And being grounded, any induced charges would adjust accordingly.

So when we place a charge q near the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges will adjust so that the sphere remains at zero potential. Wait, no. Or maybe the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is typically taken as zero.

But wait, when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. For a conducting sphere, the charges will spread out uniformly. Since the sphere is grounded, any extra charge (if any) can leave via the ground.

Hmm, so the presence of charge q induces a charge on the sphere. Let me think: the sphere initially has no charge because it's neutral. When we bring a positive charge q near, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the near side, creating a negative charge there. The far side will have a deficiency of electrons, appearing positive. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow away. So the sphere will have an induced negative charge? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait no, because if the charge q is positive, it would attract electrons to the near side. So the near side of the sphere would have more electrons (negative charge), and the far side would have less (positive). But because the sphere is connected to ground, which is a large reservoir of charges, the electrons can flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge? Or maybe the sphere ends up with an induced charge opposite to
