Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when it passes through the equilibrium point, right? But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are probably more complicated.

The question gives me a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. I'm supposed to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are a bit of a mix between classical and maybe some relativistic terms.

Wait, what's the difference between the relativistic and classical cases here? In classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But that's assuming non-relativistic speeds. Since this is a relativistic problem, I can't use that directly.

So, I need to think about relativistic energy considerations. The total energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, in relativity, the total energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But for a harmonic oscillator, the energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. So at the maximum amplitude, all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point (where speed is max), all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy isn't just KE + PE like in classical mechanics. Instead, the total energy is relativistic, so maybe the energy equation needs to account for both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the principles of relativistic mechanics. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, all the energy would be potential. But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx², is it? Or is it treated the same? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (K) is given by K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. And the potential energy (U) is (1/2)kA² because it's the maximum. Wait wait, no. At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic is zero. So at that point, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA²?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², which for x=A is (1/2)k A². But if the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, then E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Hmm, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to equate the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential) in the relativistic case. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), it has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. So the total energy E is just the potential energy U = (1/2)k A². But that doesn't account for the rest mass energy. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: in the case of a relativistic oscillator, the potential energy might not be (1/2)k x² as in the classical case. I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is modified when considering relativistic effects. Oh right, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the equation might involve terms with velocity. Wait, the force is F = -k x, but relativistic dynamics involve F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum.

So, let's think about the equation of motion. The force is F = dp/dt. And since F = -kx, then dp/dt = -k x. But p, the relativistic momentum, is γ m v, where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So putting it together, d(γ m v)/dt = -k x.

This is a second-order differential equation because x is a function of time, and v is dx/dt. Hmm, maybe it's difficult to solve directly, but perhaps I can find an expression for the maximum speed using energy considerations.

At maximum amplitude, the speed is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, speed is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is equal to the maximum potential energy and the maximum kinetic energy.

Wait, but the potential energy in the relativistic case might still be (1/2)k A², assuming the same form as classical. So E = (1/2)k A².

But also, the kinetic energy at maximum speed is E = (γ -1) m c². Because the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

Wait no, in the relativistic case, the total energy is E = γ m c². So at maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so E = γ m c². But at maximum amplitude, E is the potential energy, which is (1/2)k A². Therefore, equate these two expressions.

So (1/2)k A² = γ m c².

Wait, that can't be right, because at maximum amplitude, the speed is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no: at maximum amplitude (x=A), the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. So the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)k A². But in the relativistic case, the rest energy is mc², so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A²? Or is it just E = (1/2)k A²?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. But that might not be correct. Another approach: in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the vibrational energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position, all the energy is kinetic. So at that point, E = (γ) m c².

So equate the two expressions for E:

(γ) m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, so γ m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's right. Because in the non-relativistic case, when A is small, (k A²)/(2 m c²) would be very small, so γ would be approximately 1, which is correct.

But let's see. Then, γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

We can write this as γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

We can rearrange for (k A²)/(2 m c²) = γ -1.

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that seems manageable. Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, β, for simplicity. So β = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So equation becomes 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + β.

But this seems a bit messy. Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + β)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/((1 + β)^2).

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/((1 + β)^2).

Which can be rewritten as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + β)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + β)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2β + β² - 1 ) = 2β + β².

So v²/c² = (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2.

But since β is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which for small A would be small, so beta squared would be negligible compared to 2 beta. So perhaps for the purposes of the problem, beta squared is negligible. But I'm not sure, the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is the classical non-relativistic solution. But in our relativistic case, we have a different expression.

Let me compute v_max in terms of beta.

v_max^2 = c² [ (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2 ].

= c² [ (2β (1 + β/2) ) / (1 + β)^2 ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of beta.

Wait, but perhaps I can find an expression for v_max in terms of beta and c.

Wait, let me take the reciprocal of 1 + beta.

Wait, let me think again. The equation we have is:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as something else, maybe D. So D = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + D.

So, sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + D).

Squaring both sides:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + D)^2.

Then, v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + D)^2.

Which is the same as [ (1+D)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2D + D^2 -1 = 2D + D^2.

So v^2/c^2 = (2D + D^2)/(1 + D)^2.

Hmm, perhaps if D is small, then D^2 is negligible, so v^2/c^2 ≈ (2D)/(1 + 2D).

But if D is small, 1 + 2D ≈ 1, so v ≈ sqrt(2 D) * c.

But D is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), so sqrt(2D) would be sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) ).

Wait, wait, sqrt(2D) is sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) ) * sqrt(2) ?

Wait, let me compute 2 D: 2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So sqrt(2D) is sqrt( (k A²)/(2 m c^2 * 2 m c^2) )? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, D = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So 2D = (k A²)/(m c^2).

So sqrt(2D) = sqrt( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) = (A sqrt(k/(m c^2)) ).

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I should express the numerator and denominator in terms of D.

Wait, the numerator is 2D + D², denominator is (1 + D)^2.

So (2D + D^2) / (1 + D)^2 = [ D(2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find v_max in terms of D.

But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Let me look back at the options.

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/( (1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )).

Wait, seems complicated.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )).

Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the equation for v_max.

From earlier, we have:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (2D + D²) / (1 + D)^2 ]

= c^2 * [ 2D (1 + D/2) ) ] / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently, but it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (2D + D^2) as D(2 + D) and (1 + D)^2 as 1 + 2D + D^2.

So v²/c² = D(2 + D) / (1 + D)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, let's suppose that D is not zero. So perhaps I can write this as:

v²/c² = [ D (2 + D) ] / (1 + D)^2.

But I'm not seeing the relationship to the options yet.

Wait, another approach: let me try to compute v².

v² = c² * [ (2D + D²) ] / (1 + D)^2.

= c² * [ 2D + D^2 ] / (1 + D)^2.

Let me compute each option for v_max and see which could match.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/( (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) )^2 )).

Hmm, that seems to have a term (k A^2)/(2m). But in our D, we have (k A^2)/(2 m c²). So perhaps if D is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), then (k A^2)/(2 m) )= D c².

Wait, substituting D = (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so (k A^2)/(2 m) )= D c².

So the denominator in option A is (1 - D c² )^2.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me plug it into option A:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/( (1 - D c² )^2 )).

Hmm, that might not match our expression for v.

Wait, our v is c times sqrt( [2D + D² ] / (1 + D)^2 ).

Which is c times sqrt( (2D + D²) ) / (1 + D).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor D out of the numerator.

(2D + D²) = D (2 + D).

So sqrt(D (2 + D)) / (1 + D).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the energy equation again.

Wait, another way: the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, which is (γ -1) mc². So:

(γ -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2) k A².

Wait, that would imply (γ -1) mc² = E, but I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, no. The total energy E should be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy, which in the classical case is (1/2) k A². But in the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy is the same as in the classical case. So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, the energy is all kinetic, which is (γ -1) mc². So:

(γ -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply (γ -1) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²), leading to γ = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But that seems different from earlier.

Hmm, maybe that's not the correct way to model it.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is just the relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy.

Wait, that's a different approach. So E = (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k A².

But then, at maximum speed, all energy is kinetic, so (γ -1) mc² = (γ -1) mc² + (1/2)k A².

Which would imply 0 = (1/2)k A², which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is that in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, which is (1/2) k A².

So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At maximum speed, all that energy is kinetic, which is (γ - 1) mc².

So:

(γ -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Which implies γ -1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to model the energy.

Alternatively, maybe the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator isn't (1/2)k A² as it is in the classical case. I'm not certain about that.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the virial theorem. In the classical harmonic oscillator, the average kinetic and potential energies are equal. But in the relativistic case, this might not hold. But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equation of motion and try to find the maximum speed.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is:

d/dt (γ m v) = -k x.

But this is a second-order ODE, which is tricky. Maybe it's easier to use energy.

Wait, another idea: The equation for the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by:

(1/2) m ω² A² = (γ -1) m c²,

where ω² = k/m.

So that's the potential energy equals the kinetic energy at maximum speed.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) k A², and the kinetic energy is (γ -1) m c².

So setting them equal:

(1/2)k A² = (γ -1) m c².

So γ - 1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Same as before.

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Which I can write as:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2.

So v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Hmm. Let me compute the right-hand side.

Let me denote S = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2.

Which is equal to [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2.

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2S + S² -1 = 2S + S².

So,

v²/c² = (2S + S²) / (1 + S)^2.

Factor numerator:

S (2 + S) / (1 + S)^2.

So,

v² = c² * [ S (2 + S) ] / (1 + S)^2.

Hmm. Let me plug S back in.

S = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c^2 * [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²))^2.

Simplify numerator:

= c² * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ) ] ] / denominator.

Factor out the denominator:

Denominator is [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) ]^2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from the numerator terms.

Let me denote T = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). So,

v² = c² * [ T (2 + T) ] / (1 + T)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write 2 + T as (1 + T) + 1.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator again.

Numerator: T(2 + T) = T (2 + T).

Denominator: (1 + T)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ T (2 + T) ] / (1 + T)^2.

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as c² * [ T/(1 + T) ] * [ (2 + T)/(1 + T) ) ].

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression.

Wait, let's compute each term.

T = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ T (2 + T) ] / (1 + T)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

= c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) / (2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ] )

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Let me see if this can be simplified.

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2):

Wait, [2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)] = 2 [ 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ].

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as:

(k A^2)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

= [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * 2 ] + [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2) )^2 ]

= (k A^2)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (T (2 + T) ) / (1 + T)^2 ]

= c^2 * [ (T (2 + T) ) ] / (1 + T)^2.

Hmm.

Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )).

Hmm, perhaps if I can write the expression as such.

Wait, let me compute 1 + 1/(1 - S), where S is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

That would be 1 + [1/(1 - S)] = [ (1 - S) + 1 ]/(1 - S) ) = (2 - S)/(1 - S).

But in our earlier expression, v_max^2 is c² multiplied by [ T (2 + T) ] / (1 + T)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly match. Let me check option D:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, that's 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2.

Which is exactly what we have for v²/c², because:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + S)^2.

So for option D, the expression is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ).

Which would mean that v^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/(1+S)^2 ), which is exactly our result.

Looking at the options, option D is:

D) v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

So that would be the correct option.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the vibrational energy. At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (where the speed is maximum), all the energy is kinetic, which is expressed as \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( S = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + S}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + S)^2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + S)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( S = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
