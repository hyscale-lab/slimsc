Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after some time has already passed without decay.

So, the setup is that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. Then, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay is a random process, so the probability doesn't just add up linearly. The key thing is that the decay process is memoryless. That means the probability of decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as it would have been from the start for 150 minutes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the given 32% is the probability within 100 minutes. So maybe I should model this with the decay equation. Let me get the formula right. The decay probability, or the fraction decayed, is given by N = N0 (1 - e^(-位t)), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time.

Alternatively, the probability of decay P is 1 - e^(-位t). So P = 1 - e^(-位 t).

In this problem, P is 32% or 0.32 for t=10
