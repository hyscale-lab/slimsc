Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

So, the given data includes phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I guess we're only considering up to l=4 here.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a partial wave expansion. The imaginary part of the amplitude along the incident direction (θ=0) is something to do with the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by certain factors.

Right, the scattering amplitude f can be written as a sum over all angular momenta l: f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) ) e^{i l φ} ). But I'm particularly interested in the imaginary part when the scattering is along the beam, which I think corresponds to θ=0. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when the scattering is along the beam, that's when θ=0, which is a forward scattering direction. But the question says to find the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So maybe θ=0, but I'm a bit confused about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the total scattering amplitude at θ=0 degrees. So, I need to compute that.

Wait, I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by something like (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (2l+1) times sin(δ_l), because when θ=0, sin(lθ) is zero for all l, except when l=0. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The term for each l in f(θ,φ) is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) e^{i l φ} divided by 2ik. So, for θ=0
