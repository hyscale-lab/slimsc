Okay, let's try to figure out what compound this is. So, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. I remember that the molecular formula can help narrow down possible structures, especially functional groups.

Looking at the IR data first. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. But wait, amide protons are typically around 3300-3500, right? Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Because amides have carbonyl around 1650-1700, but maybe esters are higher, like 1720-1740. So that could be an ester or maybe a formamide?

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's go through each peak.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. Because a triplet with 3H suggests it's next to a CH2 group. So maybe an ethoxy group?

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad singlet could be an NH group, but wait, the IR suggested N-H. But the integration is 2H. Oh, wait, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but why broad? Or perhaps it's an NH2 group, but then the integration doesn't add up. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to something else, like a carbonyl.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet with 2H. Quartet usually has coupling with a neighboring triplet (like 3 neighbors). So maybe this is a CH2 connected to another CH2, which is connected to an O. So like OCH2CH2CO something. Wait, or perhaps it's an ethyl ester. Let's think: if it's an OCOOR group, like an ester, then the ethyl group would have the CH2CO as a quartet. So maybe the 4.5 ppm is the OCH2CO part. So if the ethyl is -OCH2CH2CO-, then the protons next to the oxygen (OCH2) would be a quartet. Wait, but the 4.5 is a quartet, and the 1.20 is a triplet. That fits an ethyl group, where the CH2CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2, and the adjacent CH2 (OCH2-) would be a quartet around 4.5. So that makes sense for an ethyl ester group.

Then, at 7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H, and 8.0 ppm, another doublet, 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton each. In a
