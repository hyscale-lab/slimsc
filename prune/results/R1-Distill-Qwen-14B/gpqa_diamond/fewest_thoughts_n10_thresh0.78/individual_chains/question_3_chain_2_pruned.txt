Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So first, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured that observable many times on the system in the given state. The formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz + 5σx. Maybe I can split this into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. Then find the expectation value of each part separately and add them together. That should make it easier.

Wait, because the expectation value is linear, right? So ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, where A and B are operators. So that should work.

So first, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this might be straightforward.

The eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ is -1. Because σz|↑⟩ = +|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So the state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2 times the eigenvalue for |↑⟩ plus |b|^2 times the eigenvalue for |↓⟩.

Calculating |a|²: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 0.25 * (+1) = 0.25.

|b|²: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding these together: 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, multiply by 10: 10 * (-0.5) = -5. That's the expectation value for 10σz.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates aren't |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly compute the expectation value as I did for σz.

Wait, what do I know about σx? Oh right, σx is the spin in the x-direction. So for a spin-½ particle, the eigenstates of σx are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

But maybe there's another way without changing the basis. I remember that the expectation value of σx can be found using the components of the state. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula involving the coefficients a and b.

I think the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2 times the real part of (b* a'), but wait, let me recall the correct formula. Oh wait, for a two-level system, the expectation value of σx is given by ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 )? Or is it 2 times the real part of something else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. The operator σx in the computational basis (|↑⟩, |↓⟩) is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state ψ is in the form a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, so the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the trace of σx multiplied by the density matrix.

So, the expectation value can be calculated as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. Let's write out the components. The state ψ is [a, b]^T, so ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx is a 2x2 matrix:
[[0,1],
 [1,0]]

So, σx |ψ⟩ is [b, a]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* b + b* a*, because when you do ψ† σx ψ, it's the sum of the components after the matrix multiplication.

Wait, let's compute it explicitly. Let's compute:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a* , b*) [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [a; b ].

Multiplying σx and |ψ⟩ gives [b; a].

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (a* , b*) * [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

Since a and b are real numbers here (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, respectively), the complex conjugates are the same as the original. So it's a*b + b*a = 2ab.

So, a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2, so ab =
