Okay, so I have this question about qPCR that a scientist is doing. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my qPCR concepts, but I'll try to remember.

The question says the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted controls with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means each cycle doubles the DNA perfectly. The R² is 1, so that's a perfect correlation, meaning the curve fits the data really well. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that in qPCR, the slope of the calibration curve is related to the efficiency. The formula I think is slope = -3.3219 / efficiency. Since efficiency is 100% here, the slope should be -3.3219, which is close to what they have (-3.3). So that's correct.

Looking at the data: each concentration has three CT values. Let me list them out.

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average would be around 34.2. Each is about 0.3 apart.

At 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Again, about 0.3 apart.

At 1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Same pattern.

At 100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Again, 0.3 each.

At 10: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Hmm, that's a bigger jump. Wait, 20.7 to 21 is 0.3, but 21 to 21.3 is 0.3 again. So each replicate is about 0.3 apart.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies in the results. So the options are about why the CT values don't align with the copy numbers, perhaps.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not right; qPCR is used for quantification. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target amount. But the R² is 1, so the Ct values are perfectly aligned. So B might not be right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, wait. The idea is that each ten-fold dilution should change the CT by about 3.3 cycles because of 100% efficiency. Since the slope is -3.3, a tenfold reduction in copies should increase the CT by about 3.3. Let's see the data:

From 100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold dilution. The CT goes from ~34.2 to ~30.9. The difference is about 3.3 (34.
