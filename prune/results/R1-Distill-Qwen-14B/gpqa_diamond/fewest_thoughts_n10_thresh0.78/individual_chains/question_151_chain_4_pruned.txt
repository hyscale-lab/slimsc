Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum, but let's see if I can figure this out. So the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome.

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, wait, I think I misread that. Oh wait, no, the state is a column matrix, so it's a vector. So the vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T, I guess. Or maybe the way it's written is (-1, 2, 1), which probably is the same as a column vector.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. Let me look at the matrix elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, wait, but observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian matrices, right? Because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes. So I should check if P is Hermitian. Let me look: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), so the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, (1,3) is 0. The (3,2) is also 1/sqrt(2). So the matrix is symmetric. So P is Hermitian because it's equal to its transpose, given that all elements are real. So that's good, because the observable must be Hermitian.

The question is to find the probability that the measurement of P will yield 0. Hmm. So in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the projections onto the corresponding eigenvectors.

Wait, but wait a second. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible outcomes. Then, if 0 is an eigenvalue, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

Alternatively, if the state is |ψ>, then the probability is |⟨p|ψ⟩|², where |p⟩ is the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

But wait, I need to make sure that 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. Let me think about the matrix P.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Because P is a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues are real. Let me try to find its eigenvalues. Let's write out the matrix P.

P looks like this:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2),
