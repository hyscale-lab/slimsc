Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. 

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured to be θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 10^62, B) 10^59, C) 10^66, D) 10^65 J/K.

Wait, right, entropy for a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. I remember the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. Or wait, maybe it's (A)/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length? Let me think. Oh right, the formula in terms of area is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (1/k_B), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, no, let me get the exact formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B). Wait, actually, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (ħ c)/(k_B G), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is often written as S = (A)/(4 l_p²) where l_p is the Planck length, but considering the constants properly.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula in my notes. Oh wait, no, I can't do that right now. Let me think: the area A is π r², where r is the Schwarzschild radius, which is 2 G M / c². So, A = π (2 G M/(c²))² = 4 π G² M² / c^4.

But perhaps I can find M from the angular size. The angular size θ is given, but I think θ relates to the size of the event horizon. The event horizon's radius is r = 2 G M / c². Then, the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size (r) divided by the distance (d). So θ ≈ r/d.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first to make the units compatible. Let me compute θ in radians.

θ (radians) = θ (degrees) * (π / 180) ≈ θ_deg * 0.01745 radians. So for θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees, θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So, r = θ_rad * d. But wait, if the object is very far away, like a galaxy, the angular size is small, so the approximation θ ≈ r/d holds. So r ≈ d * θ.

Wait, d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to convert that into meters. I remember 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 pc = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So r ≈ d * θ_rad = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 radians = let me compute that.
