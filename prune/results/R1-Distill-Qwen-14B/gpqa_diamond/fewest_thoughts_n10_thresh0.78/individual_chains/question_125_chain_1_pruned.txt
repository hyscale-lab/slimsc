Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that the potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r², which is the harmonic oscillator potential. So, the particle is like a 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Wait, what's the energy levels like in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator? Oh right, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Or wait, sometimes it's written in terms of the principal quantum number. Oh right, another way: the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). So the total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ). 

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that right. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. 

So the ground state is when n_x, n_y, n_z are all zero. So the energy is (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would have one of them as 1, the others zero. So energy would be (3/2 +1) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Then the next excited states would have higher combinations.

But wait, the third excited state. Hmm. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of quanta. The ground state is n=0 (n being the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z? Or is that not the same? Wait, no. The total n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So ground state is n=0, first excited state is n=1, then n=2, n=3, etc.

Wait, no. Wait, the states are categorized by the total n. So for each n, the possible states are those where n_x + n_y + n_z = n. The ground state is n=0: E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. First excited state is n=1: E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited would be n=2: E = (2 +3/2) = (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3, so E = (3 +3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Oh, so the third excited state has energy (9/2) ħω.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because sometimes people count the ground state as the zeroth excited state. So ground state is 0th, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So yes, third excited state is n=3.

So the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω → 9/2 ħω. So that part is clear.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue? That is, for E = (9/2) ħω, which corresponds to n=3, what is the degeneracy, the number of possible eigenfunctions with the same energy.

The degeneracy comes from the number of ways n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. So I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

This is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 2) choose 2. So for n=3, that's (3 + 2 choose 2) → 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.

Wait, but wait: isn't there another consideration about the angular parts, like spherical harmonics? No, wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on the radial quantum number and the angular part is handled by the spherical harmonics. But in the case of the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are degenerate based on the angular momentum quantum number l as well. Wait, no, actually, in the isot
