Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry question here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about two chemists talking, and one says his compounds are "on top of each other." I need to figure out what that means in a chemistry context.

Hmm, I remember that when compounds are "on top of each other," it's often a term used in chromatography. Oh wait, right, in chromatography, compounds that have similar properties tend to interact more and thus have similar retention times. But wait—no, the question is about their physical state or interactions, not separation.

Wait, another thought—maybe it's about how well they can be separated by chromatography. If two compounds are on top of each other, perhaps they are eluting together because their properties are too similar. So the chromatographer can't separate them because their retention times are too close. But the question is about why they are on top.

Alternatively, think about the physical properties. If two compounds have similar polarities, they would interact in the same way with a stationary phase. So if they're both polar, maybe they stick together more, leading to issues in separation. Or perhaps in a mixture, they might form azeotropes if their boiling points are similar, making distillation tricky.

Wait, let me think. If two compounds have similar polarities, they might have similar solubilities. But the term "on top of each other"—maybe it's more about their physical interactions, like how they stack in a column or in a solution.

Oh, another angle: in crystal structures, if molecules have similar van der Waals interactions, they might stack on top of each other, making a crystal lattice. So maybe the compounds are bonding through non-covalent interactions, causing them to aggregate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Similar polarities. If they have similar polarities, maybe they have similar solubility in a solvent, but how does that make them stack? Or maybe in a mixture, they don't separate because their properties are too alike.

Option B: Bonding through non-covalent interactions. So if they have non-covalent (van der Waals) interactions, they might stick together, making their compounds form aggregates, hence being "on top."

Option C: Similar boiling points. If they have similar BP, they might not separate during distillation. But the term used in the question is about their arrangement in a lab setup, perhaps during a reaction or purification.

Option D: Similar optical rotations. That's more about chirality and their direction of rotation. Not directly related to physical stacking.

So the question is about why the compounds are on top of each other, which likely refers to their interaction. So, if the compounds have similar non-covalent interactions, they might bond together, causing them to be stuck or layered on top.

Alternatively, in a chromatography column, if compounds have similar affinities, they come out together. But the conversation is about synthetic organic chemistry—maybe it's about purification or separation. If during a reaction, the products don't separate because they interact too much, leading to a mixture.

Wait, another thought: when two substances have similar polarities, they may not separate well in a column. But the term "on top of each other" could also imply that in a thin-layer chromatography setup, the spots are close, making them hard to distinguish.

Wait, the reply is "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." So the issue is
