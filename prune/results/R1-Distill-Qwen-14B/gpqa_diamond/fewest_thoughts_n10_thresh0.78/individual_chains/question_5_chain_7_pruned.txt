Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin have eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues, and these eigenvectors represent the possible states of the system when measured along a specific axis.

The problem says the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

And the operator P is along n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n can be represented with its components in x and z. Let me think, the direction vector in x-z plane would have angles θ and φ. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would mean that the angle phi (the azimuthal angle) is either 0 or 180 degrees? Or maybe not, because the x-z plane could have any phi, but perhaps in this problem, the direction is at some angle in the x-z plane. Hmm, perhaps it's better to parameterize the direction vector. Let's say n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. But wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n = (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ). Wait, no, wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector in the x-z plane would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ), but that depends on the convention. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, perhaps I can express the operator P as a combination of P_x and P_z.

Wait, the general approach for finding the eigenvectors of an operator along an arbitrary direction is to construct the operator in that direction and then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The operator P is the vector operator, so along direction n, it's P ·
