Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron, maybe?) in a 1S0 state. Then, they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Hmm, I remember that Pauli statistics deal with identical particles. Since the nucleons are identical, their combined state must be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, the problem statement says something about the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to apply the condition T = S + L +1 mod 2.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0: 2S+1 =1, so S=0. L is S, meaning S=0. Wait, no—wait, the first part is 1, so 2S+1=1 → S=0. Then L is S, which is maybe a typo? Or wait, wait, the term is 1S0. Oh, right, the notation is (2S+1)LJ. So S is the spin of the system. So in 1S0, S is 0, so (2*0+1)=1, so the term is ^1S_0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The term symbol: 1S0. So that's (2S+1)LJ. So 1 is the (2S+1), meaning S=0. The next part is S, which is the orbital angular momentum. So L is S, but wait, S is not the same as orbital angular momentum. Wait, no, the notation is that the second part is the
