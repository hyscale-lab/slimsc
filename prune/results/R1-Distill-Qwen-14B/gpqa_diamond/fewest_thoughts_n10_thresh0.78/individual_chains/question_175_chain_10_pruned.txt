Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through. 

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees and what the form of f is.

Wait, so the first part is about the fraction of maximum power at a specific angle. The second part asks for the dependence of the function f on lambda.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of the angle theta. But I'm not exactly sure. Oh right! The radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). Wait, or was it (sin²(theta)) or something like that? Let me think.

No, wait. The radiation from a dipole antenna is maximum along the equatorial plane, so theta = 90 degrees. Because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis. Wait, but the problem says the charge distribution is along the z-axis. So the maximum would be at 90 degrees? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation is actually directed perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the maximum radiation is at theta=90 degrees. So the pattern depends on cos(theta), maybe.

Wait, another approach: The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is given by the square of the sine of theta. Or is it the square of the cosine? Let me think.

No, wait, the electric field in the far zone for a dipole is proportional to (1/r) * sin(theta) * e^{i(kr - ωt)}, something like that. So the intensity, which is proportional to the square of the electric field, would be proportional to sin²(theta). Wait, but wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, for a dipole varies as (sin²(theta)) times some function of wavelength
