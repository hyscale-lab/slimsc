Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy needed for a nucleus to reach 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem states that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has an atomic number of 3. So, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make the mass number A = 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, right? Because Li usually has 3 protons and varying neutrons. So the mass of this nucleus is important.

The question is about relativistic energy. The speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high. I remember that when objects approach the speed of light, their relativistic effects become significant. So I'll need to use the relativistic energy equations.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Calculating gamma: Let's see, v is 0.96c. So (v/c)² is 0.96² = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root
