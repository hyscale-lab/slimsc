Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about cobalt ions and thiocyanate forming complexes. I remember that stability constants are involved here. The question is asking for the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. 

Wait, the problem gives me the stability constants β1 through β4. Stability constant, right, that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. So higher β means more stable complex. 

The setup: the solution has Co(II) ions and SCN- ions. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. 

So, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm guessing the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands. Because I remember that Co with different ligands can have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ would have different colors based on n.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- . So each step adds another SCN-.

The stability constants are for each step. So β1 is the constant for the first formation: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ , β1=9. Then β2 is for adding another SCN: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0, with β2=40. Beta3 is adding another, so β3=63, and β4 would be adding the fourth, giving β4=16.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the stepwise constant. So the overall constant for each complex would be the product of the previous βs.

So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, the formation constant is β1 =9. The second step to [Co(SC
