Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so I'm guessing it's related to particle decay lengths.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula for that involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * v * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, c is speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But how do I get tau, the proper lifetime? Oh, right! The proper lifetime is related to the particle's width. The width Γ is the energy uncertainty, and from the uncertainty principle, Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let's get the units straight. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Gamma is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait wait, no, wait. Wait, Γ is the decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, that makes sense.

Next, I need the velocity v. To find v, I can use the relativistic energy relation. The energy E is the total energy, which is gamma times m c^2. So E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is E/(m c^2). But wait, E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², so perhaps I can compute gamma directly.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is
