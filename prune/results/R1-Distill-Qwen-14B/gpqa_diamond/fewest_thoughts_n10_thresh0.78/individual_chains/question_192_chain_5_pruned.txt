Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, with r being smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. So, this is a problem involving electrostatics and conductors. I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange. But wait, in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged. So, when we add a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's charges will redistribute to cancel the electric field inside the conductor material, right?

Wait, but since the conductor is uncharged, I think the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces must balance out. Let me recall: when a conductor is placed in an external electric field, the charges rearrange on the surfaces. But in this case, the charge is inside the cavity. Oh right, the conductor being neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity's wall) will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q.

Wait, so the conductor's total charge is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q to balance it. So, the outer surface's charge is +q.

But wait, I've heard something about the shell theorem. So, the electric field outside a conducting shell depends only on the charge enclosed within the shell. So for the conductor, any charge outside it doesn't affect the field inside, and any charge inside the cavity would have its effect felt as if it's outside. Hmm, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

In this setup, the conductor is a conductor, so the charges are free to move. The charge inside the cavity (the +q) will induce a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a +q. So when you are outside the conductor, the electric field you feel is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface's charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the conductor isn't a point charge, it's a sphere. So the field outside a conducting sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Oh right, that's the shell theorem. So if the outer surface has +q, then the electric field outside would be as if the charge is at the center.

But wait, in
