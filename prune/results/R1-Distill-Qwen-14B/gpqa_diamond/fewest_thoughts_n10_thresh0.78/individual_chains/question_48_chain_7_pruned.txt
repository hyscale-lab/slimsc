Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. The steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2.
3. Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3.
4. Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride to form product 4.

The question asks how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. Let me break down each step. 

First, cyclohexanone. That's a cyclic ketone, so a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Structure-wise, it's a chair conformation, but the actual structure might not matter at each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine. Wait, bromine adds to carbonyl groups? I think that's the case. Cyclohexanone has a ketone, so when bromine (Br2) is added, it probably undergoes an addition reaction. Oh right! The bromide would add across the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a diastereomeric dibromide. Wait, but I remember that cyclohexanone when treated with bromine (in a non-polar solvent maybe?) undergoes a ring-opening, right? Or wait, no, that's in the case of cyclic ketones reacting with HBr or other agents. Alternatively, another possibility is that cyclohexanone could undergo bromination via an enol mechanism, but that's more common with other reagents like HBr and HBrO, perhaps. Wait, wait.

Alternatively, could it be that cyclohexanone is undergoing a haloform reaction? Oh, but the haloform reaction usually requires multiple methyl groups on the carbonyl. Cyclohexanone has only a single methyl group attached (since it's a six-membered ring with a ketone). So haloform reaction probably doesn't apply here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Adding bromine to a ketone could form a bromohydrin. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's
