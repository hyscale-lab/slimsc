Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm. Let me think. The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember something about the energy of light and colors. Oh right, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to a specific color. And the color we see from a substance is the complementary color of what it absorbs. Because if a substance absorbs, say, blue light, the remaining colors (which include red and yellow) combine to look orange or something.

But wait, the question is about emission. Oh wait, no, the question says the dye emits light with that energy. So emission is when the molecule releases energy. But the key here is that the energy emitted is related to the energy absorbed. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the complementary colors. So if the dye emits a certain color, it must absorb the complementary color. Wait, no, that's for the color we see. Let me think again.

The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I should probably convert that to wavelength to find out what color it is. Because each color corresponds to a specific wavelength range.

I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So if I have E, I can find λ.

But wait, I should check the values. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since we're dealing with eV, there's a conversion factor. Oh right, 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 joules.

So E (in J) = 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = let's calculate that. 2.3393 * 1.602 is approximately 3.747 (since 2*1.6 is 3.2, and 0.3393*1.6 is about 0.5429, so total about 3.7429e-19 J).

Then E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

Plugging the numbers in:

h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide that by E (3.747e-19 J):

λ = 1.9878e-25 / 3.747e-19 = approximately 5.307e-7 meters, which is 530.7 nanometers.

Wait, 530 nm is in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, the options don't have green. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

E = 2.3393 eV → E_joules = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 = let's compute 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19, and 0.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 0.543e-19. So total E ≈ 3.747e-19 J.

h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ = (1.9878e-25) / (3.747e-19) = (1.9878 / 3.747) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.5305e-6 meters → 530.5 nm.

530 nm is green light. But the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow. Hmm, none of these is green. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not the emitted. Oh wait wait, I think I mixed that up.

Because when a substance emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. The energy it emits is the energy difference between its excited state and the ground state. But the absorption would correspond to the energy needed to get to the excited state.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy absorbed. So if the emission is 2.3393 eV, the absorption is that energy plus the energy difference between the excited states? Or is it the same?

Alternatively, perhaps emission is the energy difference between the two states, and the absorbed energy would be the same as the emission energy. Wait, no. The absorption would be the energy that the molecule absorbs, which then it emits. So when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy state to a higher one, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon with energy E.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states (the transition). So the emitted photon has energy equal to E. So the absorbed photon's energy is E, right? Or am I getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the absorption is when the molecule takes in energy, and then when it emits, it releases energy. But the energy of the emitted photon (E_emitted) would be less than the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorbed), because some energy is lost as heat or other processes. Oh, but in fluorescence and such, the energy emitted is typically lower than what was absorbed.

Wait, but in this problem, the question is about what color is absorbed. So the energy emitted is given. So if the molecule emits at 2.3393 eV, what is the energy it absorbs?

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the absorbed light is higher than the emitted. Because when the molecule absorbs a higher energy photon, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits a lower energy photon. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than the emitted.

But I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should think about the energy levels
