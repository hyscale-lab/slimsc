Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile is usually an enolate, and it adds to the beta position, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. 

The question has three parts, each being a Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Then, match them with the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. So, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In such conditions, it would deprotonate the alpha position of the carbonyl compounds to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. Its structure is (CH2COOEt)2, which is symmetric. The enolate would form at the central carbon. So the enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The acrylate is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2-CH-CO-OEt, but the double bond is between the first and second carbon. Wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but here, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so maybe the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but the p-tolyl group is at the third position. Hmm, maybe the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but in this case, there's a substituent on the acrylate chain. So, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but where is the p-tolyl group attached?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group attached to the double bond. Wait, no, because the name is 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The 3-position would be the CH2 end. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the substituents are on the double bond. Wait, in this case, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Oh, wait
