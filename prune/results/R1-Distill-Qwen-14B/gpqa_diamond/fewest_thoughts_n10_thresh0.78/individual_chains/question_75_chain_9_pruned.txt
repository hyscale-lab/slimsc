Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid to do this, and they've introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, but the protein isn't being overexpressed. They're looking for the reason why.

The problem is that the construct isn't working as expected. The options are A to D. Let's look at the DNA sequence they provided. The plus strand is given, right? So the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. I should check whether the reading frame is correct, any stop codons, or issues with the sequence.

Wait, let me think about each step. The person cloned the GADD45G gene with an HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA is added before the GADD45G coding sequence. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the cells. They selected for antibiotic resistance, implying the plasmid has a selectable marker. Once they started, they couldn't overexpress the protein.

Looking at the possible issues, the options are about why the protein isn't expressed. Let's think about each option.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If there's a mutation in the HA tag, it might affect purification. But the problem is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's not being purified. But maybe the HA tag isn't causing the expression issue. Alternatively, if the HA sequence is messed up, perhaps the construct isn't being expressed correctly. But I'm not sure.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean there's a premature stop codon somewhere in the sequence. Let's check the DNA for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons. The sequence is written as the plus strand, which is the coding (non-template) strand. So the mRNA is complementary to this, right? Wait, no. Wait, DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as the mRNA. So to find the codons, I need to look at the sequence in triplets, starting from the ATG.

Let me scan through the sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

The first codon is ATG, which is methionine, start. Then TAC is Tyr, then CC... Wait, let me write this out in triplets.

The sequence starts: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC C GGA AAG CAC AGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTG AGT TGC TGC TGC TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCG TCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCC AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGT GCT GCT GCG GTG AGG AGG AC CAG GCG ACG CGC GTG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACC TGC ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACA TCG AC A TAT GCG CGT GGG CGA TGT CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ACG TGG GCG CCC GCG GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAG TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA TCC CGC CTT GGA GAA GCT CAG CCG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAG GAC TGG GTG CCA GCA TCA CTC CCC CGG AGT GA.

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me go through each triplet to see any TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the mRNA sequence, which is the same as the plus DNA strand.

Wait, the DNA sequence is in the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA. So, looking for any TAA, TAG, TGA codons in the mRNA
