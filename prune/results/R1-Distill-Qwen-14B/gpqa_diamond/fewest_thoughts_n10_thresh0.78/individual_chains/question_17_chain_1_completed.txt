Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question says that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, the first thing I remember is that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, Kf, tells me about the stability of the complex. A higher Kf means a more stable complex.

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex (I think Ca-EDTA is usually like CaY²− where Y is the EDTA), the stoichiometry is 1:1. So, the formula would be CaY²−.

In solution, this complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But because Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. That means the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

The formation constant Kf is given by the equation:

Kf = [CaY²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Since the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that's [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− as x each because for every mole of CaY²− that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4− are produced. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4−] = x.

Plugging into the equation:

Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know Kf is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 which is 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait.

Wait sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root of 4 is 2. Square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-7)^2, no. Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 1e-13 is one order of magnitude smaller. So sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5 M is x.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7, because 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = approx 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That's matching.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the setup right?

The formula is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Since the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x each of Ca²+ and EDTA, that setup is correct.

So yes, the concentration of Ca²+ should be about 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\), is 0.02 M. Since the dissociation of the complex produces one mole of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and one mole of \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), their concentrations are equal, denoted as \( x \). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} = 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
