Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativistic mechanics. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so Lithium's usual isotope has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, right? Oh wait, no, the problem says 3 neutrons. So that would make it Li-6, because Li normally has 3 protons, so adding 3 neutrons gives mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

The problem asks for the energy of the nucleus in the collider. I think that refers to the total energy, which would be the relativistic energy since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m_0 * c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So I'll need to calculate gamma first.

Given v = 0.96c. Let me plug that into the gamma formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/(c^2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 minus 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Wait, no, wait, wait. Because sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that again. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check. 1/0.28 is 3.571428... approximately.

Wait, but wait, wait another thing. Let me think. 0.28 * 3.5714 is roughly 1. So yes, that's correct. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. I'm a bit shaky on exact mass values, but I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found using the atomic mass in atomic mass units (u), and then converting it into energy using the conversion factor 1 u = 931.5 MeV/cÂ².

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The mass of Li-6 is needed. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. Li-6 has 3 protons and
