Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? The second planet has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the first.

Options are A to D, with numbers around 7.5 to 37.5 days.

Hmm. So the first thing I need to understand is what factors determine whether a planet transits and occults. I remember that transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star (from our view, the star eclipses the planet). For both to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it passes in front and behind the star relative to us.

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to this? Oh, I think it's about the size of the orbit. The orbital period is given by Kepler's third law, which relates the period to the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits, which they are here). So for the first planet, we can find the semi-major axis, then figure out what's the maximum possible for the second planet.

But wait, both transit and occultation events require that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. So there's a condition on the orbital distance relative to the star's size.

Wait, another thought: For a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star. The transit impact parameter tells us how close it passes to the center. Impact parameter b is defined as the distance from the star's center at the time of transit, divided by the star's radius. Wait no, I think the impact parameter is the distance in units of the star's radius. So if the impact parameter is 0, the planet passes directly in front of the center. If it's 0.2, then the closest approach is 0
