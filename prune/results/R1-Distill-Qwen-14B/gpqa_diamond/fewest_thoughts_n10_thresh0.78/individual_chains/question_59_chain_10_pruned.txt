Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let's see what I can do.

The problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide). Hmm, that's a mix of acids and a strong base. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I should probably start by figuring out if there's a neutralization reaction happening here.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with the acetic acid: it's a weak acid. The formula for moles is Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). So for CH3COOH, it's 0.1 M * 0.5 L. Let's compute that: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Okay.

Next, the HCl. That's a strong acid. Its moles are 0.2 M * 0.4 L. 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. So 0.08 moles of HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit provides two OH- ions. Wait, so the moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives two hydroxide ions, the moles of OH- are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to figure out the reaction between the acids and the base. The total H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, providing 0.08 moles of H+. Acetic acid is a weak acid; it won't fully dissociate, but maybe I can treat it as contributing some H+ which I'll account for later.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so both OH- will dissociate completely, giving 0.18 moles of OH-.

So the total H+ from acids: CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, but since it's weak, it doesn't fully contribute. HCl is 0.08, strong so contributes 0.08. So total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) + some from acetic acid. Hmm, maybe I should consider the neutralization first, and then see if there's excess acid or base.

Wait, let's think. The base (OH-) will react with the H+ from the acids. So the OH- can neutralize the H+.

Let me calculate the total H+ and OH- available.

Total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH: HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. Acetic acid gives some H+; but since it's a weak acid, maybe I can approximate it as 0.05 moles? No, wait, that's not right. Because the dissociation isn't complete. Wait, but in this case, since we're mixing it with a strong base, perhaps the H+ from the acetic acid will react with the OH-, but I'm not sure if I can ignore it or not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, let's think about all the H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH: It's a weak acid, so
