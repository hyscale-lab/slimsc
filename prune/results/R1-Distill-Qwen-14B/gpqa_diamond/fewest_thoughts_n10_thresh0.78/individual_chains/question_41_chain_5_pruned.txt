Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when materials move, it affects how light propagates through them, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer? Or wait, same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer? Oh, no, the beam itself is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam—so both are moving towards the observer. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, let me read again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (so also towards the observer) at velocity v. Wait, but the beam is in the glass, right? So the glass is moving, and the light beam is inside it.

Wait, no—no, the light is propagating through the glass. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So, if
