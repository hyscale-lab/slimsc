Alright, so I've got this electromagnetism question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. Okay, the question is about finding the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember potentials are important in Maxwell's equations, especially when dealing with electromagnetic fields produced by charges in motion.

The setup: there's a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). At some earlier time tr, the charge was at a position, and now, at time t (which is after tr), we're observing the fields at point r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r.

Wait, so how do potentials work for a moving charge? I think when a charge is moving, it's not just the Coulomb potential anymore. Because the charge is moving, there are magnetic effects too. So the fields would involve both electric and magnetic contributions.

Right, the scalar potential V is related to the electric field, and the vector potential A relates to the magnetic field. The potentials are typically based on the retarded time, which is why the fields depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

Let me recall the expressions for V and A. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential but with a correction factor due to the motion. Oh wait, no, the Coulomb potential is when the charge is stationary. When it's moving, the potentials are affected by the retarded time.

Wait, the retarded time is when the fields are based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, such that the light (or the electromagnetic wave) from that time reaches the observer at time t. So the distance would be the separation d, which is r - (v * (t - tr)/c?), but maybe I should think in terms of the expressions.

I remember that for the scalar potential, it's given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1 over the distance, but with a term that includes the velocity. Oh wait, wait, the denominator is (d c - d·v), or something like that. Because d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So the denominator would be dc minus the dot product of d and v, all in the same units.

Wait, let me get the units straight. d is a distance, so it's in meters. v is in meters per second. So d·v would be (m^2/s), right? And c is the speed of light, m/s. So dc would be (m * m/s) = m²/s. So that makes the denominator have the same units as d·v. So that makes sense.

So for the scalar potential V(r, t), it's (q c) divided by (4πε₀) times (d c - d·v), right? Because I think the denominator is (d c - d·v) in the denominator. So the expression would be V = qc/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The scalar potential for a moving charge, using the
