Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the setup: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, so Lorentz factors are gamma here. For the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. Since the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is in the opposite direction of the electron. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the system is isolated, the total momentum must be conserved. Also, energy is conserved. Oh, right, in the case of annihilation, the rest mass of the electron and positron is converted into photons. But wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass. So the rest mass energy is 2 * m_e c², since each has m_e.

But wait, the particles are moving, so their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy will contribute to the total energy. So I need to calculate their relativistic energies.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each particle, their total energy is gamma * m_e c², and their momentum is gamma * m_e * v. Hmm, but since v is in terms of c, maybe it's easier to express momentum in terms of gamma and beta. Oh, right, beta is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Wait, no, actually beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, perhaps another approach. The four-momentum of each particle. The electron and positron are moving in opposite directions
