Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so things might get a bit more complicated than the usual Newtonian mechanics.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this 1D system. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know regarding relativistic oscillators.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic scenario, I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds approach the speed of light. The key here is that the total energy in relativity includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy, but I'm not sure exactly how that factors in.

The oscillator obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore because of relativity. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

At maximum speed, all the potential energy should be converted into kinetic energy. So maybe I should set the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy. Wait, but the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case might still involve the rest mass energy. Hmm.

Let me think: At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at that point.

Wait, but in the relativistic oscillator, the total energy isn't just the sum of rest and kinetic. The total energy is γmc². So when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential plus rest energy. But I'm not sure how that interconnects.

Alternatively, maybe the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the mass is at the equilibrium point, all of this energy is its total relativistic energy. So E = γmc². Therefore, γmc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, that seems like a plausible approach. Let's write that equation: γmc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

I can rearrange this to find γ:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

But wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can set up the equation:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to model the energy. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's the energy that's added to the rest energy. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc². And when the mass is moving, E is γmc². So:

γmc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Yes, that's what I wrote before. Now, solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Wait, but γ must be greater than 1, which it is because (kA²)/(2mc²) is positive. So that's correct.

Now, let's express γ as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²):

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it x for now. So x = (kA²)/(2mc²).

Then, the equation becomes:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + x.

But I need to solve for v. So let's square both sides:

1 / (1 - v²/c²) = (1 + x)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + x)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2].

Let me compute this expression. Let's write 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 as [ (1 +x)^2 -1 ]/(1 +x)^2.

Expanding (1 + x)^2 gives 1 + 2x + x². So (1 +x)^2 -1 = 2x + x².

Thus,

v²/c² = [2x + x² ] / (1 + x)^2.

But x is (kA²)/(2mc²). Let me plug that back in.

So numerator: 2x + x² = 2*(kA²/(2mc²)) ) + (kA²/(2mc²))^2

Simplify: 

= (kA²/(mc²)) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

Denominator: (1 + x)^
