Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I remember about binary stars and how to approach this.

So the question says we have two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the two stars around their common center of mass. So the period is the same as the orbital period for each system.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for each star in each system. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. So I think I need to relate the radial velocities to the masses. I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will be closer to the center, so it moves less, while the less massive star moves more. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

Oh wait, right! The mass ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio. So if star A has a velocity v_A and star B has v_B, then mass_A/mass_B = v_B / v_A.

But wait, each system is a binary, so the total mass is mass_A + mass_B. Let me think about how to find the total mass for each system.

Another thing I remember is Kepler's third law for binary systems, which relates the orbital period, the masses, and the size of the orbit. The formula is something like (P^2) * (M1 + M2) = (4π²/G) * a³, but I'm not sure if I need that here. Wait, maybe there's a way to relate the velocities and the period to find the masses.

Wait, since the velocity of each star is related to the size of their orbits, which are in turn related through the mass ratio. The orbital period is the same for both stars in a binary system because they orbit each other.

Let me think. The velocity of each star is given by
