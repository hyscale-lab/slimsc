Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question gives a density matrix rho, and I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinate triplets.

First, let me remember what a density matrix is. A density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |psi><psi|. For mixed states, it's a statistical mixture of projectors.

The given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). That looks familiar. Wait, I think this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a qubit system. Because when you have equal probability of being in |0> and |1>, that's a maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I'm trying to recall how density matrices are represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of qubit states. For a pure state, the state is on the surface of the sphere, and for a mixed state, it's inside.

The Bloch vector for a qubit is represented as a vector (x, y, z), where each component corresponds to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z).

So, let's expand our given rho. The given rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of Pauli matrices.

I remember that |0><0| can be written as (I + σ_z)/2, and |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. So when we add them, |0><0| + |1><1| equals [(I + σ_z)/2 + (I - σ_z)/2] = (2I)/2 = I. 

So substituting back into rho: rho = (1/2)(I). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors, their sum is the identity matrix for a single qubit? Oh wait, no, because |0> and |1> are orthonormal and complete. So |0><0| + |1><1| equals the identity matrix I for a 2x2 system. So rho becomes (1/2)(I).

But wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if rho equals (I)/2, that would mean r·σ is zero. Because I is the identity matrix, so (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0). Because all components x, y, z are zero. So the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, I can think about the diagonal elements and the off-diagonal elements. The given rho is diagonal with entries 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are zero. In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix is (I + r_x X + r_y Y + r_z Z)/2. The diagonal terms are (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2. Since both diagonal elements are 1/2, that implies 1 + r_z = 1, so r_z is zero. The off-diagonal terms would be (r_x ± i r_y)/2, but since they're zero, r_x and r_y must be zero too. So r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is the Bloch vector, and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we note that the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are both \( \frac{1}{2} \). This implies that the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must satisfy \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \), as all components of \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) vanish. Therefore, the density matrix corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
