Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about what happens when a certain compound reacts with hydrogen bromide. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Oh wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw it out mentally.

So, the structure is benzene with an ether group attached. The ether group is connected to a butenyl chain. Butenyl means there's a double bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 2 positions, so it's 2,2-dimethyl. So the chain is but-3-en-1-yl, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the numbering starts from the benzene. So the substituents are on carbon 2, which is the second carbon after the benzene.

Wait, let me get the structure right. The group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy attached to benzene. So butenyl has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Numbering from the benzene oxygen, the chain is:

O
|
O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2

Wait no, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2CH2C=CH? No, wait. Let's think: butenyl is four carbons, with the double bond starting at position 3? But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond from position 3 to 4? That can't be right because but only has four carbons. Wait, maybe but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. No, wait, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4? So structure is CH2
