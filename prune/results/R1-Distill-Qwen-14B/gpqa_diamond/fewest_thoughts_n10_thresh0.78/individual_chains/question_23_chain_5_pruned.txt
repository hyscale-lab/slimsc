Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question involves a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they check with TLC and see the reactant spot is smaller, and two new spots. So the reaction has proceeded, and there are two products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction, right? Like the H adds to one end and Br to the other, but wait, that's for alkenes. But in this case, the molecule is an ether, so maybe the HBr is acting as an acid catalyst or something else.

Wait, the structure is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that out. The benzene ring has an ether oxygen, connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure of the butenyl is: CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, wait. Wait, but the but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. Let me get that right. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- ? No, wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at the third carbon? Wait, numbering might be tricky.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3? No, wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2 something. Wait, butenyl groups can be 1, 2, or 3 positions. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but wait, the butenyl group is four carbons in total. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because that would make it similar to a 1-propenyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the but-3-en-1-yl group would have a four-carbon chain where the
