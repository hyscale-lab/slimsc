Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total mass is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through some tubes, and based on the weight changes, we need to deduce what's happening.

So, the setup is as follows: the gases go through three tubes. Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Tube 3 is red-hot copper. The weights of tubes 1 and 3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively. Tube 2 didn't change. And finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

Hmm. Let me think about each step. So, when the salts are heated, they probably decompose. Since it's without air, it's likely a decomposition reaction without oxygen or moisture. The products are gases, which are then passed through these tubes.

So, first, the gases pass through Mg(ClO4)2. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent and can react with water. But wait, it's anhydrous. So, if the gas has water vapor, Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. The weight gain in tube 1 is 3.60 g. That suggests that water was present in the gas mixture. Because when Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water, it gains mass equal to the water it absorbed.

So the first gas, let's say gas X, is water vapor.

Wait, but wait. Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, so if the gas had water, the tube would gain that mass. So, 3.60 g of water is absorbed here. So, the moles of water are 3.60 g / (18 g/mol) = 0.2 mol.

Next, the gases go through Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. If the weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 were present, it would react with Ca(OH)2, forming CaCO3 and water, leading to a weight gain. But here, the weight is the same, so no CO2 in the gas.

Then, the gases pass through red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. The most common is CO2, but wait, but earlier we saw that there's no CO2. Alternatively, maybe CO reacts with copper? Or perhaps another gas.

Wait, but red-hot copper in the presence of a gas could be reacting with something like sulfur dioxide? Or maybe it's about water again? Or perhaps the gas is something else.

Wait, when the gas passes through red-hot copper, the weight increases by 0.80 g. The product is CuO. So, let's think about what reacts with copper to form Cu
