Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Oh, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, so that fits. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, the compound probably has a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group. So maybe a benzoic acid?

Now, the NMR data. Let's parse this. 

The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably the O-H proton from a carboxylic acid. It's broad because of hydrogen bonding, and it's a singlet since there's no neighboring protons.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to 2H. That suggests two aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. So maybe two protons adjacent to substituents on a benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. This could be the other two aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituents are at the para positions.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet for 1H. Maybe a methine group (CH) adjacent to something electronegative, like a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to 2H. Could be CH2 groups near an electronegative atom.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet (or doublet?) integrating to 3H. A methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, likely a methyl at the end of a chain, like a ethyl group.

Putting this together, the structure must have a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see. The aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are each a doublet, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, two substituents are at para positions. Wait, but the doublets would be for adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a monosubstituted benzene with substituents in a way that causes two sets of doublets. Wait, no, para substitution would have two protons each on either substituent, but I'm getting a little confused here.

Wait, maybe the substituents are at positions 4 and 1. No, perhaps it's a para-disubstituted benzene. Let me think: in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other. So for example, two substituents on the benzene ring at positions 1 and 4. No, wait, para is 1,4 positions. So if a benzene has two substituents in para positions, the ring protons would be two sets of doublets. For example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 3, but that's meta. Hmm, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Wait, no, that would be the same as 1 and 4 being substituents, but how would that affect the aromatic protons?

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has a single substituent that itself has substituents, like a side chain. Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid, so the ring is attached to a COOH group. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The 10.5 ppm peak is likely COOH, so that's a carboxylic acid. Then, the aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are each doublets. Let's consider a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that is a carbonyl group. If the substituent is in the para position, then the ring would have two equivalent protons adjacent to the substituent on each side. Wait, but if the substituent is a -COOH group attached to the benzene, then the ring would have a substituent in one position (let's say position 1), and the next substituent is perhaps another group in position 4, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has a substituent that is a carbonyl group connected to another carbon chain. Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm peak is a multiplet of 1H, maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, the 1.7 ppm is two Hs in a multiplet, perhaps a CH2 next to a CH. The 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet) for 3H, so a CH(CH3) group. Oh, so maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl
