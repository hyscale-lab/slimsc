Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting can tell us about the structure. So, a triplet usually means each proton is split by two neighboring protons. Similarly, a quartet would be split by three neighboring protons.

Let me think about what structures could give this. The 6H triplet at 0.9 ppm sounds like two equivalent CH3 groups. Because a triplet for 6H suggests each CH3 is next to a CH2. For example, maybe a (CH2CH3) group, but let's see. Wait, waitâ€”each CH3 in a diethyl group? Or perhaps a cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane protons usually show up higher. 

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. So, if two ethyl groups are attached to something, each CH2CH3 would split into a triplet. But wait, the quartet comes from 4H. So, if the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like an ether. Oh wait, but 1.3 is a bit low for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 between two CH2 groups. Let me think: if you have a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's part of a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, another approach: the triplet for 6H is probably two CH3 groups. Each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. So, perhaps a structure like CH2CH2-C-something. Oh, maybe it's a diethyl
