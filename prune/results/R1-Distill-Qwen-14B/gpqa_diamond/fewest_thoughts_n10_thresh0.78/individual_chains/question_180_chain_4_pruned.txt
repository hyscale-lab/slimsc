Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The question says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I guess I don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, so this is an electrostatics problem, right? Because we're dealing with charges and electric potential energy. Since the system is isolated, the charges can't interact with anything else, so their potential energy is what determines the system's energy.

Hmm, the charges are all identical and have the same charge, 2e. So each particle has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup is that 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So, point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Wait, but each charge is 2e, so when calculating potential energy between two charges, it's the product of their charges divided by the distance between them, right?

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think this refers to the minimum potential energy, which occurs when the charges are arranged in a configuration that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P, but their positions relative to each other might vary. But wait, no, the problem says each is at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other could be anywhere on a sphere of radius
