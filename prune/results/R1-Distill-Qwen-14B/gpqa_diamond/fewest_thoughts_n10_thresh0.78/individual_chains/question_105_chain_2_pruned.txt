Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface, and the spots are cooler by 1000K compared to the star's effective temperature of 6000K. The setup is that these spots cause brightness variations as the star rotates, similar to how an exoplanet would transit in front of the star. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same brightness variation amplitude.

Hmm, so I think the key here is to compare the change in brightness caused by the spots to the change caused by a planet transit. Both cause dips in brightness, so we can model both scenarios and set their brightness changes equal to each other.

First, let's understand the star with spots. The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The dark spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so does that mean 20% of the entire star's surface? Because a hemisphere is half the surface. Oh, wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, the spots take up 20% of that half. So total area with spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar². But maybe I don't need to get into the exact area yet.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So Teff is 6000K for the star, and spots are at 5000K.

The brightness variation from the spots comes from the difference in their emission compared to the rest of the star. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing the observed brightness to dip. Similarly, a planet would block some of the star's light as it transits, causing a dip.

The goal is to find the planet radius Rpl such that the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as that caused by the spots.

Wait, but the problem says "if the star was not covered by spots!", so the brightness variation is due to the planet. So both the spot scenario and the planet scenario produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots and set it equal to the amplitude from the planet's transit, then solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Let me think about each case.

Case 1: Spots on the star.

The brightness variation occurs because the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the total emitted flux decreases. The variation in brightness (ΔF) is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

The star's total flux when all spots are visible (i.e., when the spotty hemisphere is facing us) versus when they are not.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's brightness variation depends on the rotation. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star rotates, the spots will come into and out of view. Let me model this.

The flux from the star without any spots: F0 = σTeff^4 * (Surface Area) * (Filling Factor? Wait, no, because without spots, F0 is just the total emission from the star.)

Wait, the star's luminosity is L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. But when part of the surface is cooler, the total emitted flux changes.

The spots have a lower temperature, so their contribution is less. The total flux when spots are visible is L = (L0) * (1 - F_spot), where F_spot is the fractional area covered by spots times the ratio of their flux to the star's flux.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the total flux from the star when spots are visible is:

L = L0 * (1 - F_spot * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)) ), where F_spot is the area fraction of the spots.

Wait, the spots are at T_spot = Teff - 1000K = 5000K. So the flux from each spot is σ T_spot^4, while the flux from the rest of the area is σ Teff^4.

So the total flux when the spots are on the visible side is:

L = (1 - F_spot) * σ Teff^4 * A_visible + F_spot * σ T_spot^4 * A_visible,

where A_visible is the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no, A_visible is the area of the star's surface (a sphere), but when you have a hemisphere, the area is 0.5 * 4π R² = 2π R². Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire star.

Alternatively, think in terms of the star's surface. The fraction of the surface covered by spots is F_spot_area = F_spot_hemisphere * area of hemisphere / total area.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So F_spot_area = (0.2) * (π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.2 * (1/4) ) = 0.05. So 5% of the total surface area is covered by spots.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each hemisphere is half the surface, so 20% of that hemisphere is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10% of the entire surface? No, wait, wait. Let's clarify.

The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², hemisphere is half that). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

The total surface area of the star is 4π R². So the fraction of the total surface covered by spots is 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, or 10%.

So F_spot_area = 10% = 0.1.

But wait, the star is rotating, so only the hemisphere facing us is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view as the star rotates. So when the star is in a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are contributing less flux. The variation in brightness depends on how much the spots' flux differs from the normal flux.

Wait, the star's brightness variation occurs as the spots rotate into and out of view. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is less than when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible
