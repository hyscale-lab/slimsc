Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So, the question is asking where this particular rho matrix is located in the qubit space.

The given density matrix rho is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because each of the basis states |0> and |1> are equally weighted, each with a coefficient of 1/2. So rho would have diagonal elements of 1/2 each and zeros elsewhere. So in matrix form, it would be a 2x2 matrix like this:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere, but this is a density matrix, not a pure state. So the Bloch sphere representation is for pure states, and density matrices are more general. How is the density matrix's position determined geometrically?

I think the Bloch vector comes into play here. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. The components of r correspond to the coefficients in front of the Pauli matrices.

Let me write out the equation. The density matrix rho can be expressed as:

rho = (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z) / 2

So the given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1| ) / 2. Let me compute this. Let's recall that |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Wait, so rho is (I)/2, because (|0><0| + |1><1|) is I.

So rho = I/2. Then according to the Bloch representation, rho = (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set rho equal to I/2, then I/2 must equal (I + r·σ)/2. So multiplying both sides by 2 gives I = I + r·σ. Subtracting I from both sides: r·σ =
