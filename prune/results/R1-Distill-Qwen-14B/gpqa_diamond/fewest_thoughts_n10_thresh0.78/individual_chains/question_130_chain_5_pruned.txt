Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my redshift and wavelength concepts, but I remember that redshift (z) relates to how much the wavelength of light is stretched as it travels through the expanding universe. The formula I think is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted wavelength.

So the Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, right? But in this case, the neutral hydrogen is absorbing that light, so the absorption line would be in the quasar's spectrum. Wait, but we're talking about when the quasar's light is observed through these clouds. So the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms if the cloud is moving away (since that's redshifted).

Wait, but the question is about detecting this absorption with an optical ground-based telescope. So the absorption must be in the optical range for the telescope to see it. Because if the absorption is in the infrared or beyond, ground-based optical telescopes can't see it. Oh wait, but wait, the quasar itself emits in the optical, but the absorption line is due to intervening hydrogen.

So let's think. The Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. If the hydrogen is at redshift z, then the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1+z). So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1+z) Angstroms.

Now, for the absorption line to be in the optical range. Wait, optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to about 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So 1216*(1+z) should be within that range.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. Oh wait, no, wait. If the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen
