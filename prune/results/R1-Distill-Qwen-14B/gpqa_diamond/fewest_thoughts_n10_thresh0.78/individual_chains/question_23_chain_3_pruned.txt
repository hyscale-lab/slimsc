Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC, and they saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. So I need to figure out what the products are from the options given.

Hmm, the starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me write that structure down. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a butenyl group. But wait, the butenyl is substituted: 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me visualize that.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. So numbering from the end where the oxygen is attached. So but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4, so actually, wait, that would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but it's 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So for the butenyl group, the substituents are on C2. So the structure is:

The butenyl group is -OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl: the position of the double bond is between C3 and C4, right? So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But with substituents. Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl, so on the second carbon.

So the butenyl group is:

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that doesn't fit the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

The butenyl group is: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4; but then with substituents at C2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe it's better to draw it.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot diminished, with two new spots. So I have to pick which products are formed.

Hmm. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction, probably via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. The starting material here is a substituted benzene ring with an ether group attached. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally.

The butenyl group is attached to the oxygen. So the substituent is O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No wait, wait. But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait, no. Let me correct that. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at positions 3 and 4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl group: the parent chain is butene, four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons. So 3-en would be between C3 and C4? But that's the same as 1-en if we number it the other way. Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C3? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm misnumbering. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at carbon 3? Wait, how can that be? Because four carbons, the double bond can be at 1,2; 2,3; or 3,4 positions? Wait
