Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. 

So, there's a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the position, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3, not outside that range. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding the particle in a certain region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 should equal 1 (because total probability is 1).

Wait, but the wave function given here has an imaginary component. Oh right, because it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So, ψ(x) is a complex function. Let me write that down: ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i.

The modulus squared of a complex number a + bi is (a)^2 + (b)^2. So, |ψ(x)|² would be [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2.

So, |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, I remember that wave functions must be normalizable. For the wave function to be a valid probability distribution, the integral of |ψ|² from all space (or in this case, the region where the particle exists) must be 1. So, in this case, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but if the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is as I thought, but wait, does this make sense? Because the wave function usually has a real and imaginary part. But in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Hmm, but when you square the modulus, it's (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). So, that's correct.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx equals 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, let's split the integral into two parts:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) ] dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of [0.25] dx = 1.

Compute the first integral: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So, evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral is a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 ∫ dx from 1
