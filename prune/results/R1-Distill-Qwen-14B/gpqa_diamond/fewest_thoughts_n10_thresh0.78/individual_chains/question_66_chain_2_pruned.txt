Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that encapsulates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries they must respect. Let me think this through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is a big one. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So all operators must transform properly under Lorentz transformations. That includes rotations, boosts, etc. So option 1 is definitely a yes.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But wait, the SMEFT is a field theory, which by definition is Poincare-invariant. Because field theories have local symmetries and Poincare is part of that. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is also a yes.

Now, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I think that in the Standard Model, some operators respect CP and others don't. Wait, but in SMEFT, do the operators have to respect CP symmetry? I'm not so sure. I think that SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry. Because some operators in the SMEFT can violate CP. For example, operators that change the strong CP might be present. Wait, but wait, the SM already has certain CP violation, like in the CKM matrix. But in SMEFT, when you include higher-dimension operators, do they automatically respect CP? I think not. So operators can violate CP. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry, so option 3 (CP) is not a must.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge-Parity-Time reversal symmetry. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, CPT must be a symmetry. Because of the way the theory is constructed, especially since it's quantized. So even if the theory doesn't respect CP, it must respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because Lorentz symmetry ensures that. So option 4 is a yes.

So putting it together: Lorentz (1) yes, Poincare (2) yes, CP (3) no, CPT (4) yes.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 1,2,4. So that's Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but I thought field theories are Poincare-invariant, so that's correct. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4. Which is option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, meaning all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1). Since SMEFT is a field theory, it is also Poincaré-invariant, as field theories inherently respect Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry and translations (2). Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry as well.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not a requirement for SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already includes CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry (3) is not a necessary symmetry for SMEFT operators.

Finally, CPT symmetry is required in any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, as it arises from the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) symmetries. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and a quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry (4).
