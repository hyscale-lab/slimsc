Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for various complexes.

Let me start by jotting down what I remember. Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The complexes have different stability constants, which tell us about their stability. The higher the beta (β), the more stable the complex.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, usually β is for each step. So, for each additional SCN- added, the β is the stepwise constant. So, the formation goes like Co(H2O)6^2+ + SCN^- → Co(H2O)5(SCN)Cl^- + ... and so on.

Wait, but sometimes the stability constant is given for the overall complex. Hmm, but in the question, the βs are given for each successive complex. So for each n, βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth step.

So the complexes would be:

Co^2+ (aq) → Co(SCN)1^2- : β1 = 9
Co(SCN)1^2- + SCN^- → Co(SCN)2^2- : β2 =40
Co(SCN)2^2- + SCN^- → Co(SCN)3^2- : β3=63
Co(SCN)3^2- + SCN^- → Co(SCN)4^2- : β4=16

Wait, wait, no, that might not be the case. Because β1 would be for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So the overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, the stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the overall K, which is the product of the stepwise β's. So, for example, β1 is the K for the first addition, β2 is the K for the second, and so on.

So the overall β for each complex is:

β_total_1 = β1 =9
β_total_2 = β1 * β2 =9*40=360
β_total_3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680
β_total_4= β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. Sometimes, the stability constant is given as the overall constant for the complex, not stepwise. But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16." So maybe each β is the overall constant for each
