Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of each product. The options are A to D, each with two values.

Hmm, right, I remember from my studies that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. After decay, the two particles (muon and neutrino) must have equal and opposite momenta because the total momentum must still be zero.

Wait, but the neutrino is massless? Or does it have a rest mass? I think in this context, the neutrino is considered massless. Or maybe it's treated as having negligible mass. That might affect the calculations. Or perhaps the problem gives the rest mass, but I don't see a rest mass for the neutrino here. The problem only gives the Pi and mu masses. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So, let's think about the energy and momentum conservation.

The initial energy is just the rest mass energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So E_mu = gamma * m_mu c^2, and E_nu = p_nu c, since the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

Conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Conservation of momentum: since the pion was at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Hmm, but wait, because the muon has mass, its momentum is related to its kinetic energy. Let me think. The total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). And the neutrino's energy is just E_nu = p_nu c. But since p_mu = p_nu, I can write E_nu = p_mu c.

So putting it all together:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ) + p_mu c

Let me let x = p_mu c, to make the equation easier.

So, equation becomes:
139.6 = sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + x

I can rearrange this. Let me subtract x from both sides:

139.6 - x = sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Now, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(139.6 - x)^2 = x^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:
139.6^2 - 2 * 139.6 * x + x^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2

I can subtract x^2 from both sides:

139.6^2 - 2*139.6*x = 105.7^2

Compute 139.6 squared and 105.7 squared.

Let me calculate:

139.6^2: let's see, 140^2 is 19600. Subtract (0.4)^2 and 2*140*0.4*(0.4)? Wait, no, wait. Actually, 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*(140)*(0.4) + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

105.7^2: similarly, I can compute 100 +5.7 squared. Or perhaps just multiply 105.7 *105.7.

105 *105 is 11025. 105 *0.7 is 73.5, so 11025 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7². Wait, no, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100² + 2*100*5.7 +5.7² = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 10000+1140 is 11140, plus 32.49 is 11172.49.

So putting back into the equation:

19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x = 11172.49

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 2 *139.6 x

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49:

Well, 19488 - 11172 is 8316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33. So 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 x

Compute 2*139.6 = 279.2

So x= 8315.67 / 279.2

Let me compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is just a bit more than 8315.67. So perhaps approximately 29.8.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = ?

279.2 *20=5584, 279.2*9=2512.8. So 5584+2512.8=8096.8. Now 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.784.

So x is approximately 29.784. Let's say about 29.78 MeV.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2 gives 8100. That's not right. Wait, perhaps better to do exact division.

Wait, maybe I can do this better.
