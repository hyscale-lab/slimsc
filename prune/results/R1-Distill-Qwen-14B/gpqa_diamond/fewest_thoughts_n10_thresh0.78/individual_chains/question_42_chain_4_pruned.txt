Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there are three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They give some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth. We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so that simplifies.

Wait, T_star is the effective temperature of the star, R_star is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. So the formula simplifies to T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * sqrt(1 - albedo).

But wait, since all three planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between planets should depend inversely on the square root of their distances from the star.

The problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as 1.4. Let's denote T1 as Planet1's temperature, T2 as Planet2's. So T1/T2 â‰ˆ 1.4. Since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2 a1)) * sqrt(1 - albedo), and similarly for T2. So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) * (sqrt(1 - albedo) for both planets, but since albedo is the same, it cancels out). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Therefore, (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Wait wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If T1 is the temperature of Planet1, and T2 Planet2, and T1 is larger than T2, that means Planet1 is closer to the star. Because the closer a planet is, the hotter it is. So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then Planet1 is hotter, so a1 is smaller than a2.

So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3
