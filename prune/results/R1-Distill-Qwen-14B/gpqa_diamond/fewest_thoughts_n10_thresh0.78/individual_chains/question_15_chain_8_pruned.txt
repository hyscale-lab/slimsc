Okay, so I've got this question about planets and the probability of detecting them via the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been found using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which is probably important because eccentricity can complicate transit probabilities.

The host stars are a bit different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, and Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, but same radii so that might not matter for transit probability directly.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, which is important because the researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit, given limited time.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula for the transit probability (P) is something like (R_planet / R_star)Â² multiplied by (a / (a + R_star)), but wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the main formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, the transit probability is actually the geometric probability, which is more about the alignment. The formula is: P = (R_p + R_s) squared... No, wait, no, the basic geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by another factor. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) multiplied by (R_p / R_s) and then something else. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is the product of the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size squared, and the (a/(R_s + a)) term. Or is it (R_s / (a + R_s))?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try
