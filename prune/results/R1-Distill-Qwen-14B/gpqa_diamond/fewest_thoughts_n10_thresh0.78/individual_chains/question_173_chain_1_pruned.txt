Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me see what it's asking.

The question is about the uncertainty in the energy of an electron. The electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is given as 0.1 nanometers. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, each a different order of magnitude.

Hmm, I remember something about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Oh right, it states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The principle is often written as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, in this problem, I have Δx. I can use this to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. But wait, how?

I think ΔE comes into play through the momentum-energy relationship. Since the electron has kinetic energy, and its momentum is related to its mass and velocity, maybe I can find an expression for ΔE in terms of Δp.

Let me jot down the formulas. The Uncertainty Principle says:

Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.

Given that, the minimum uncertainty in momentum would be Δp_min ≈ ħ / (2Δx). I'll take that as the starting point.

Next, I need to find ΔE. I recall that the kinetic energy (K) of a particle is given by K = p²/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So, if there's an uncertainty in p, Δp, then the uncertainty in K, ΔK, would depend on Δp.

But wait, since we're dealing with uncertainties, perhaps I can use a differential approximation. For small uncertainties, ΔK ≈ (dK/dp) * Δp. Since dK/dp = p/m, because K = p²/(2m), so dK/dp = (2p)/(2m) ) = p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, maybe I can express ΔE in terms of Δp and the momentum p itself. Because if ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, and E is the kinetic energy, then ΔE would be related to the derivative of E with respect to p times Δp.

But perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, since E = p²/(2m), taking the uncertainty, ΔE, would be approximately (p/(2m)) * Δp. Wait, that's because if E = p²/(2m), then dE/dp = p/m, so the uncertainty ΔE ≈ dE/dp * Δp = (p/m) Δp.

But I don't know p exactly, but I can perhaps relate it to the given velocity. Since p = m*v, and we know v is 2e8 m/s.

Wait, let me think again. So, I can write:

ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But p = m*v, so p/m is v. So substituting:

ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

So, putting it all together, ΔE ≈ v * (ħ/(2Δx)).

Because earlier, Δp_min is approximately ħ/(2Δx).

So, substituting in the numbers:

ΔE ≈ v * (ħ / (2Δx)).

Let me plug in the values.

v = 2e8 m/s.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the denominator 2Δx: 2 * 0.1e-9 = 0.2e-9 = 2e-10 m.

Then, ħ/(2Δx) is 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-10) = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = (1.05/2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25.

So, Δp ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Then, multiply by v (2e8 m/s):

ΔE ≈ 2e8 m/s * 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Multiply 2e8 by 5.25e-25: 2 *5.25 =10.5. Exponents: 1e8 *1e-25 = 1e-17.

So, 10.5e-17 J = 1.05e-16 J? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2e8 *5.25e-25 = 2 *5.25 * 1e8 *1e-25.

2*5.25 is 10.5. 1e8 *1e-25 is 1e-17. So 10.5e-17 J, which is 1.05e-16 J? Wait, wait, no. 10.5e-17 is the same as 1.05e-16, because 10.5e-17
