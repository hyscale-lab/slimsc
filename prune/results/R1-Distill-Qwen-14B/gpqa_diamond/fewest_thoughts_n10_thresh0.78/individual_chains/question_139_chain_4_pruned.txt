Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment leads to the formation of two different diketones. I need to pick the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds are treated with nitrous acid (which is formed from NaNO2 and HCl), they can undergo various reactions. One reaction I'm vaguely recalling is the conversion of amines to diazonium salts, but wait, that's more for aromatic amines. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Oh right! I think alcohols, especially those with adjacent leaving groups, can undergo some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's about the formation of a carbonyl group. Oh right! The Stephen reduction? No, that's for ketones to make alkanes. Wait, maybe it's the oxidation of certain alcohols. Or wait, another possibility: the treatment could be leading to the formation of a carbonyl via elimination, perhaps forming a diketone from a diol or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The products are diketones. Diketones have two ketone groups. So, the starting materials must somehow form two ketones upon treatment.

Oh! I think I remember something about the Beckmann rearrangement. No, that's for oximes rearranging into amides. Not this case. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the formation of a geminal diol, but that's when an alcohol is treated with something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the oxidation of alcohols. But then, if an alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, what happens? Oh! Wait a minute. Maybe it's the formation of a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, I recall that when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid under certain conditions, it can undergo elimination to form a ketone. Or wait, perhaps it's a pinacol rearrangement. Oh yes! The pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols (gem-diols or vicinal diols? Wait, pinacol is vicinal diol, like 1,2-diol). 

Right, the pinacol rearrangement: when a vicinal diol is treated with an acid
