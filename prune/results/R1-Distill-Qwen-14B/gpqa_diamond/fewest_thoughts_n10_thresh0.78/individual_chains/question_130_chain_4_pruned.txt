Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, okay, I remember that the Lyman-alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. It's in the ultraviolet range. But if these clouds are absorbing that light, then that light must be redshifted into a wavelength that optical telescopes can detect.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the redshift must be enough to shift the Lyman-alpha absorption line into the visible spectrum. Oh right, the visible spectrum is roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So, the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) after redshift must be longer than 4000 Angstroms, I think. Because anything longer than that is in the optical range detectable by ground telescopes.

The formula for redshift is z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1. The rest wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms for Lyman-alpha.

So, I need lambda_observed to be >= 4000 Angstroms. Wait, but wait, what's the lower limit? Because if the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms, that's the minimum required for detection. So the redshift would be (4000 / 1216) - 1.

Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 is approximately 1.216e3, 4000 is 4e3. 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So 3.29 minus 1 is about 2.29. So the redshift z should be approximately 2.29.

But wait, the options given are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Hmm, so 2.29 is close to option C which is 2.4, but maybe my initial assumption about the cutoff is wrong. Or perhaps the lower limit is such that the observed wavelength is just beyond the atmospheric cutoff.

Wait, I remember that the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), so maybe the observed wavelength needs to be above 300 nm to be detected. If that's the case, then using 3000 Angstroms instead of 4000.

Let me recalculate with 3000 Angstroms. So z = (3000 / 1216) - 1. Let's compute that: 3000 divided by 1216 is approximately 2.467. Subtract 1 gives 1.467. So z ≈ 1.47.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option B) 1.2 and D)1.9. Hmm, 1.47 is between B and D. But wait, perhaps the question is about the lower limit such that the absorption is observable. So the Lyman-alpha line must be redshifted into the optical window. If the observed wavelength is just beyond 3000 Angstroms, then z is about 1.47, but maybe the question is considering a higher redshift to make it into the visible (like beyond 4000 Angstroms), which gives z≈2.29.

Wait, but why would they pick 4000 or 3000? Well, the atmospheric cutoff for UV is about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So anything below that is absorbed.
