Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make things easier because I don't have to change the basis.

So first, I should write down the state vector. Let me denote it as |ψ⟩. The state is a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

In the P_z basis, the eigenstates are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively. So each component in |ψ⟩ represents the amplitude of each eigenstate.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I just need to compute the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since the basis is already the eigenbasis, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Let me compute each amplitude squared:

The first component is (-1/2), so |a1|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The second component is (1/√2), so |a2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. The third component is (-1/2), so |a3|² is 1/4.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ + 0 = 0. Oh wait, because the first component is for eigenvalue ħ, the third for -ħ, and the second for 0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the state is a vector in the basis of P_z. So each component is the amplitude for the corresponding P_z eigenstate. So the first component is for eigenvalue ħ, second for 0, third for -ħ.

So the |a1|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so contributes (1/4)* ħ. |a3|² is 1/4, which contributes (1/4)* (-ħ). The middle term is zero because it's multiplied by 0.

So putting it together: ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So the average of P_z is zero.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of each eigenvalue. So each eigenvalue squared would be (ħ)^2 for the first, 0 for the second, and (-ħ)^2 = ħ² for the third.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum over |amplitude_i|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue_i)^2.

So |a1|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by (ħ)^2 is (1/4) ħ². |a2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, multiplied by 0 is 0. |a3|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by (ħ)^2 is (1/4) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1
