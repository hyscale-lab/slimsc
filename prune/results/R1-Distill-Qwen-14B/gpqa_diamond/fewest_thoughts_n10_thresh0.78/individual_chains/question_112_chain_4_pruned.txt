Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but let's see.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So that's the standard basis for spin-1/2 systems. But the state is given in terms of these, so maybe I can write it as a vector.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I should probably normalize it first. Let's compute the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The normalization is the square of the modulus of each coefficient summed.

The modulus squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly, for (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the sum is 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1/sqrt(7)) ) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator A is given as Aij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait. So it's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, in the standard basis, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z. So the operator A is acting on these states. So what are the eigenstates of A?
