Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out the answers to parts A and B, then match the options. Let's start by breaking down each part.

The question says that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional and stereoisomers. But the actual question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism.

Part A: Determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift in the position of double bonds. For example, keto-enol tautomerism. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's a cyclic diketone. Can it tautomerize? Well, if either of the carbonyl groups can shift, but in a quinone structure, the carbonyls are conjugated. Maybe the structure isn't conducive for tautomerism because the quinone is already a stable, conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can't tautomerize because the positions are too rigid.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on the cyclohexane ring. So, structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a ring. Wait, no, 1,3,5-trione would have ketones at positions 1,3,5. So all adjacent carbons are carbonyls. Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each C is connected. So, 1,3,5 would be every other carbon. So each ketone is separated by a single-bonded carbon. Can this molecule undergo tautomerism? Well, for keto-enol tautomerism, a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl must be present. Let me think. In each of these ketones, are there alpha hydrogens?

Benzoquinone: each carbonyl is part of a six-membered ring. Each carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O. So each carbony
