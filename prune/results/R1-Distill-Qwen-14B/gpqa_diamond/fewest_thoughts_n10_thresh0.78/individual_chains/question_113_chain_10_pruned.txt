Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the given data. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry.

Starting with FTIR: There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol, maybe an -OH group. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something else. Alternatively, it might be an amide or another type of carbonyl. But considering the options, which don't include nitrogen, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in a conjugated system. So perhaps it's an ester with an alkene, or maybe a ketone with an alkene.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: There's a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think what that could be. Common fragments at 45 include the CH3O group (which would be 31, but wait, 45 is higher), or maybe a CH2O group? Alternatively, I remember that the fragment for an ethyl group (like -CH2CH3) is 29, but that's not 45. Wait, maybe the molecule has a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Like a methoxy group (OCH3). The molecular ion for OCH3 would be 31, but that's too low. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an ester group. For example, if the molecule is something like a methyl ester, the fragment could be the methyl group attached to the oxygen. Wait, maybe the 45 comes from the loss of a certain group. Let me think: m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which has a molecular weight of 46? Wait wait, no, (CH3)2O is C2H6O? Let me calculate: 2 carbons (12*2=24), 6 hydrogens (1*6=6), 16 for O: total 24+6+16=46. So m/z 46 would be the molecular ion. Hmm, but the fragment is at 45. So maybe it's something else. What about the CH3CO group? Let's see: CH3CO is 43. No, that's 29 (CH3) plus 14 (CO?), no, wait, CH3CO is C2H3O2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone group. Like the fragment could be a (CH3)2CO group losing something. Or perhaps the fragment comes from a CH2O group, but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment at 45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No, not that. Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion, but that's higher. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from the loss of an ester group. For example, if the molecule is something like an ester, like RCOOR', then during fragmentation, it might lose the R' part, which could lead to a fragment. Or maybe the RCOO- part
