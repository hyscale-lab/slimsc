Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

First, I think I need to write down the state vector. The given state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me double-check that: the first element is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2. So, it's a three-component vector.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make things easier because then the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal in this basis. Looking back, the matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So, P_z = diag(ℏ, 0, -ℏ).

Hmm, right. So, when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is just the sum of the probabilities (squares of the amplitudes) multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

But wait, the state is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh, but the uncertainty in P_z would involve finding the expectation of P_z squared and the square of the expectation of P_z. Let me outline the steps.

The uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²>.

Since the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenstates, the expectation value <P_z> should be straightforward. Each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

The state vector ψ has components a, b, c, so ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of each component. Let's compute |a|², |b|²
