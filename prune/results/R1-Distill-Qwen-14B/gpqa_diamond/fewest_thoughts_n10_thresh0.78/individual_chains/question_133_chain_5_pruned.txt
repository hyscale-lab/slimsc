Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters since 1000 cm³ is a liter. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so I don't think that affects anything here, but maybe constants are temperature-dependent, but I'll assume the given Ka values are correct for this temp.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. Wait, but I should remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH—like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is the H3PO4 form, but wait, sometimes it's the same as the unprotonated form. Wait, no, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. So I'm looking for [PO4^3-].

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So I need to figure out what's happening when these two salts dissolve in water.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its dissociation in water would be: KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-. So that gives H2PO4^- ions.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissociates, it would release 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. But when dissolved in water, the 2 H2O just become part of the solution, so the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but I'm being asked about PO4^3- concentration. Hmm. So how does PO4^3- form?

Wait, maybe I need to consider the acid-base equilibria here. H3PO4 is triprotic. Its dissociation steps are:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ +
