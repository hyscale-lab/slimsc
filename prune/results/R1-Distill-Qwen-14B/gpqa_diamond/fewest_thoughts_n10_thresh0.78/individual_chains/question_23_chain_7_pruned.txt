Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw the reactant spot diminish and two new spots appeared. We need to figure out what the products are from the given options.

Hmm, alright. I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction. But wait, the starting material is an ether with a substituted butenyl group. So the structure is benzene with an oxy group attached to a butenyl chain. The substituents on the butenyl are 2,2-dimethyl, right? So the structure is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Let me draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether oxygen connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-O-. Wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait no, butenyl would be four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C2 and C3? Or wait, butenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait, nomenclature. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH- but that doesn't make sense because butenyl has four carbons. Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C3? That can't be right because four carbons can't have a 3-enyl. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me think: butenyl is four carbons. The double bond is between C2 and C3, making it 1,3-butadiene? No, wait, but-3-en-1
