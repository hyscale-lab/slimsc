Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's propene or propylene, right? Because C3H6 can be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cyclic compound). But since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, I think it's more likely propene. Because bromination of alkenes usually involves addition, whereas cyclopropane bromination might be different. So, Compound A is propene, CH2=CH2CH3.

So, when propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, it's probably an addition reaction. The bromine adds across the double bond. Propene has a structure CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,2-dibromopropane, but wait, propene has three carbons. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the product would be BrCH2CHBrCH3? Wait no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, actually, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would make the dibromide as CH2BrCHBrCH3. So that's compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So in such conditions, elimination reactions occur. Since B is a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br atoms), the reaction with KOH (alcohol) would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. The base would abstract a Î²-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond.

So for 1,2-dibromopropane, the elimination would form propene again. Wait, because 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on C1 and C2. Eliminating H from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH3, which is propene
