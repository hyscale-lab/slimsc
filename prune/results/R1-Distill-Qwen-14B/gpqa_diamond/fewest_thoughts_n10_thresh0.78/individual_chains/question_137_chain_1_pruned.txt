Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle accelerators, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy. So, T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm, I remember that in cyclotrons and similar devices, the particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by electric fields. The frequency of the electric field has to match the particle's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant. Oh right, the magnetic field increases as the proton gains energy so that the cyclotron frequency remains in sync with the accelerating electric field. That's why it's called "synchronous".

Wait, but the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. Oh, I think that refers to the number of times the voltage changes polarity, or the number of times the proton is accelerated. Each time the voltage goes through a cycle, the proton is accelerated once. Or maybe each half-cycle? Because in a cyclotron, the voltage alternates, and each half-cycle provides a push. So for each full cycle of the electric field, the proton gets two accelerations. Hmm.

So the number of revolutions would be related to the number of times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron, which depends on the time it's in the accelerator and the angular frequency of its motion.

First, I need to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV. Then, using that time, calculate how many times it revolves.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact relation. Let me think: The kinetic energy of the proton increases from 0 to 950 MeV. The energy gained per revolution might be related to the voltage and how many times it's accelerated.

Wait, each time the proton goes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes, it gains some energy. The voltage is U(t), and the energy gain per passage is approximately e
