Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, n is a unit vector, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used in spin-1/2 systems.

Hmm, I think the eigenvalues of a spin operator in a certain direction are related to the spin components. Wait, each Pauli matrix σ_i (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you take a dot product with a unit vector, like σ · n, does that change the eigenvalues?

Oh right, the dot product σ · n would be a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since each of these has eigenvalues ±1, but when you combine them, what's the effect on the eigenvalues?

Wait, the Hamiltonian here is H = ε times that dot product. So the eigenvalues of H should be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Because the eigenvalues of a scalar multiple of an operator are the scalar times the eigenvalues of the operator.

But what are the eigenvalues of σ · n? Well, since the vector n is a unit vector, the trace of σ · n is zero, because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are λ and -λ, their sum is zero, so λ must be plus and minus something. The determinant would be (λ)(-λ) = -λ². But the determinant for σ · n, since each Pauli matrix has determinant -I, but when combined, wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the trace is zero, so the eigenvalues are a and -a. So sum is zero. The product is -a². What's the determinant of σ · n? Each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, but when you take a linear combination, it's not so straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the eigenvalues of σ · n are plus and minus 1, because the Pauli matrices are trace
