Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles produced in a decay reaction. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, I guess, because the product is written as nu. So the equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Wait, right, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays at rest, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But photons or neutrinos might have different considerations, but in this case, the neutrino is a lepton, maybe like a neutrino or anti-neutrino. Anyway, the main point is momentum conservation.

So, the pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is negligible, I think, so we can treat it as massless. That might simplify things.

The question is about finding the kinetic energies of the product particles. So, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy must be the sum of energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest energy plus kinetic energy. The neutrino, being massless, will have energy equal to its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is zero). So, the total energy after decay is (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu.

But since energy is conserved, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + E_nu.

Also, since momentum is conserved and the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

I remember that the energy of a particle is related to its momentum and rest mass. For the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, no, units-wise, energy is in MeV, so maybe I can write E
