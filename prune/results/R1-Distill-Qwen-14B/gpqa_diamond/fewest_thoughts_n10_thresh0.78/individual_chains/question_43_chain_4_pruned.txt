Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if one is at position 1, the others would be at 3 and 5. Hmm, maybe I should sketch this out.

Also, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh wait, the carboxylic acid is one substituent. So the hydroxyl (-OH) and the dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) are both ortho to it. That means they are attached to the carbons adjacent to the carboxylic acid. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino would be at positions 2 and 6, perhaps?

And para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is position 4 if the carboxylic acid is position 1. So methoxy is at position 4.

Wait, but the question also says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile (cyano) group must be in a position such that both the methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to it. Let me think about that.

If methoxy is at position 4, and the nitrile is meta to the carboxylic acid, which is position 1, then the nitrile could be at position 3 or 5. But the hydroxyl is at position 2 (if carboxylic is 1). So the nitrile needs to have both 4 and 2 as ortho substituents. Wait, let's think about the benzene ring.

Position 4 is para to 1. If nitrile is at position 3, then the substituents ortho to it would be 2 and 4. Wait, position 3's ortho positions are 2 and 4. Oh, so if nitrile is at 3, then 2 and 4 would be ortho to it. So that would match because the hydroxyl is at 2 and the methoxy is at 4. Oh! So that makes sense.

So let's assign the positions:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) is position 1.
- Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6): hydroxyl (OH) at 2, dimethylamino at 6.
- Para to COOH is position 4: methoxy (OCH3).
- Nitrile (CN) is at position 3 (meta to COOH).
- Then, the carbaldehyde (CHO) is another substituent meta to COOH. Since COOH is at 1, the other meta positions are 3 and 5. But 3 is taken by the nitrile, so the carbaldehyde must be at position 5.

Wait, let me confirm: The substitu
