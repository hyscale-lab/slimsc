Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of an operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvectors that correspond to states with definite angular momentum in a particular direction.

Wait, the operator P here is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P is a vector operator, like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2. Because each component is scaled by ħ/2, the operator P itself must be proportional to the Pauli vector multiplied by ħ/2. So P = (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z), where σ's are the Pauli matrices.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it has an angle θ from the z-axis. So the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along direction n would be P·n, which is the sum of each component times the corresponding direction component.

So, P·n = (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). Since I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2, I need to solve the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)|ψ⟩.

Let me write down the matrix form of P·n. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So substituting, P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]? Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, σ_x sinθ is [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]], and σ_z cosθ is [[cosθ, 0],[0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together gives [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. So P·n matrix is (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]. I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n - (ħ/2) I)|v⟩ = 0, where I is the identity matrix. So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2)[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - (ħ/2) I ) |v⟩ = 0.

Factoring out ħ/2, we get:

[ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1] ] |v⟩ = 0.

Wait, no, let's see. The subtraction is applied element-wise. So (cosθ -1) in the (1,1) element, sinθ in (1,2) and (2,1), and (-cosθ -1) in (2,2).

So the matrix becomes:

[ [cosθ - 1, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

We can write the equations for the eigenvectors:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0,

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0.

Let me take the first equation: (cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

We can solve for v2 in terms of v1: v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

Wait, but if sinθ is zero, that's a special case. But assuming θ is not 0 or π, since in those cases, the direction is along z, and the eigenvectors are easy to find.

So v2 = ( (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ) v1.

Now, the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2] = [v1, (1 - cosθ)/(sinθ) v1 ].

So, let's factor out v1, so the vector is proportional to [1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ].

I can write this as [1, (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] because 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = tan(θ/2).

So the vector is proportional to [1, tan(θ/2) ].

But since we're dealing with a two-component spinor, we can write it as [1, tan(θ/2)] or [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] because tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2). So, if we set the first component to cos(θ/2), the second becomes sin(θ/2). Let's see:

Because [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] is a normalized vector (since cos² + sin² = 1), that's a possible eigenvector.

Wait, but let me check. Let's compute the normalization. The vector [1, tanθ/2 ] has a squared length of 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) = 1/(cos²(theta/2)). So the normalized vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Yes, that makes sense. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait. The operator we formed is P·n, which we found to have this eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but it's written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is just option C.

But wait, the options also have some other factors. Let me check the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Hmmm, no, that doesn't fit with theta. So probably not.

Option B: ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

That looks like spherical coordinates, but our solution doesn't involve phi, so probably because the direction is in x-z (so phi=0). But the operator may have a phase, but the problem is about the eigenvector, which could have a global phase. Hmm, but the eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which doesn't directly match option B.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that matches.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmmm, this has factors sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which suggests a different normalization. Wait, why would there be a sqrt(2/3) factor?

Wait, the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is already normalized, right? Because cos² + sin² =1. So if the option has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), that's a different normalization.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvector calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The operator P is a spin-1/2 operator, and the eigenvectors for a spin in direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 are the spin-up states along that direction.

In the eigenbasis aligned with n, the state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], as I thought earlier. So this should be correct.

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that.

But wait, let me think about the given matrix components again. Did I make any mistake in forming P·n?

P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

But n is in the x-z plane, so n_y =0. So P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So:

P·n = (ħ/2)( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

Which becomes (ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [
