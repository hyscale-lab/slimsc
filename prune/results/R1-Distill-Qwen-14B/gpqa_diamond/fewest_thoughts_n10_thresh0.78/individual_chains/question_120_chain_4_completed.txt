Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let's see. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The formula is distance d (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax p (in arcseconds). So d = 1/p. 

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with p. Wait, so it's about the density of stars in terms of parallax. I think I need to figure out how the number of stars depends on p.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Oh, wait, no, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, does that mean their density in space is uniform? Or just their distribution on the sky? Hmm, I think it's the former. Uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So n is constant.

So if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density n is a constant. Now, we want to find out how the number of stars in a given parallax range changes as p changes.

Parallax p is inversely proportional to distance. So lower p means farther away. But since the stars are spread out in all directions, the number of stars we observe at a certain parallax depends on how the volume element works.

Wait, I think this is about the volume of a spherical shell at a distance d. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πr² dr. So for a given distance d, the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd. But wait, since p = 1/d, then d=1/p. So substituting, the volume shell in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 ( - (1/p^2) dp )? Hmm, maybe I need to do a substitution.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n * 4π d² dd. But we want this number as a function of p. Since p =1/d, so d = 1/p. So substituting, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p^2) dp ), but wait, the limits would change when you substitute variables. Alternatively, perhaps I should express dd in terms of dp.

Wait, let me try to change variables correctly. Let p = 1/d, so dp = -1/d² dd. So dd = - (1/(p²)) dp. But since we're integrating from a lower p to higher p, maybe the negative sign can be accounted for by swapping the limits. But in terms of number per unit p, perhaps I can relate the number per unit p interval.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax p is n * 4π d² * (dd). Substituting d=1/p, so d² =1/p², and dd= -1/p² dp. So the number of stars is n *4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, but the negative comes because as p increases, d decreases. So perhaps when integrating from p to p + dp, we can take the magnitude.

So, number N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p^2) dp. Wait, that's n *4π (1/p^4) dp. That would mean the number of stars per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I have a small range Δp, the number of stars in that range would be N = (n *4π (1/p^2)) * (Δd), and since Δd = Δp / p^2, because p=1/d so dp = -Δd / d². Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternative approach: The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd is n * 4π d² dd. Express this in terms of p. Since p =1/d, then d =1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. Substituting into the expression: n *4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) = n *4π (1/p^4) (-dp). The negative sign indicates direction, but since we're considering small increments, we can take the absolute value. So N = n *4π (1/p^4) dp. 

So the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of p decreases as 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars \( n \) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (from \( p = \frac{1}{d} \)), the number of stars in terms of \( p \) becomes:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} \, dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).
