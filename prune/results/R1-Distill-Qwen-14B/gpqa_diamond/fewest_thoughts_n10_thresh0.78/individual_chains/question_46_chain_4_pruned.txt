Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, what's racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene? Well, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule isn't chiral, wait no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond. Let me draw its structure.

The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent has five carbons. So 1-pentene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon. So let's see:

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-... Wait, perhaps I should count the carbons properly. Let's number from the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the chain continues. If it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon, which is C3, there's a methyl group.

So the structure is
