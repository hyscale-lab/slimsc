Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I'll need to compute both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but the state is given as a column vector. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So it's a 3-dimensional vector, which makes sense because all the matrices are 3x3.

The operator P_z is given. Let me write it down. P_z has the first row as (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ℏ). So it's a diagonal matrix with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z in the given state. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by P_z, then multiplied by the state vector. Since all the elements are real in the state, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

Let's denote the state as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]. So ⟨ψ| is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Multiplying P_z by |ψ⟩:

First element: ℏ*(-1/2) = -ℏ/2.
Second element: 0*(1/√2) = 0.
Third element: -ℏ*(-1/2) = ℏ/2.

So P_z |ψ⟩ is [ -ℏ/2 ; 0 ; ℏ/2 ].

Then, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the dot product of ⟨ψ| and P_z |ψ⟩.

So each component:

- First component: (-1/2)*(-ℏ/2) = ℏ/4.
- Second component: (1/√2)*0 = 0.
- Third component: (-1/2)*(ℏ/2) = -ℏ/4.

Adding them up: ℏ/4 + 0 - ℏ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? Hmm, that's interesting. So the average value of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just the square of each element in the diagonal matrix because it's diagonal. So P_z² has elements (ℏ)^2, 0, (-ℏ)^2, which is [ ℏ², 0, ℏ² ] on the diagonal.

So P_z² |ψ⟩ would be:

First component: ℏ²*(-1/2) = -ℏ²/
