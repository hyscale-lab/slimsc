Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: In a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Then they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are from A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, but wait, the exact formula is plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d gives N ∝ (d)^5 because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So they're probably asking for the rate of change of N with respect to r, like dN/dr or something similar.

Wait, no, maybe not exactly that. Let me think in terms of the relationship. Since N is proportional to d^5, and d is the distance, then if you're looking at the number of stars per unit distance, does that mean the derivative of N with respect to d?

Or perhaps it's looking for the number per unit volume, considering that the volume increases with distance. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a region could be thought of as the volume of the region multiplied by the number density of stars. Because as you go further, the volume increases, which would mean more stars if the density is constant.

But in this case, the number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. Let's express everything in terms of distance.

Since plx = 1/d (in parsecs), then 1/plx = d. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but wait, the number of stars in a volume would be proportional to the volume. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr
