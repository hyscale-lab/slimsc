Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational effects or anything like that. Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and the options are given.

Wait, wait. So the setup is that one charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. But wait, each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, so they're all at the same distance from the fixed charge. So what is the system's minimum energy?

I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their final positions. But since some of the charges are identical and placed in a symmetric way, maybe there's a formula I can use.

Each charge is 2e, so q = 2e. Let me think about all the interactions. The system consists of the 13th charge (fixed at P) and the 12 charges around it.

Wait, but wait a second. The 12 charges are each at 2 meters from P. So how are they arranged? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters? Or maybe arranged in some other way? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy.

Wait, but for point charges, the potential energy is calculated based on their pairwise interactions. So maybe the minimal energy occurs when all the charges are as far apart as possible, but in this case, the 12 charges are fixed at a distance of 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to the central charge.

Wait, but the 1
