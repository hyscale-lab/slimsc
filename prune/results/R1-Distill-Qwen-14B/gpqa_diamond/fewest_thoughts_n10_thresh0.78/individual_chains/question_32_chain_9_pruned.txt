Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. Li is lithium. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons. Wait, wait. Let me confirm. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 +3=6. So X is Li-6.

Next, I need to calculate the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Since it's relativistic, I should use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So the first step is to find the rest mass of Li-6. The mass number A is 6. The atomic mass in atomic mass units (u) can be calculated. Wait, but I think the atomic mass for Li-6 is about 6.013 u. Let me check my memory. Yeah, I recall that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1.007 u for protons and around 1.009 for neutrons. But maybe for Li-6, it's a bit more precise. Alternatively, I can look up the exact value, but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed with 6.013 u.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it from the number of protons and neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and a neutron is 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665). Let me calculate that:

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828
3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995
