Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson, specifically X, into fermions. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right?

The problem gives me the Lagrangian for the interaction between the bosonic field X and the fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that doesn't look quite right. Maybe I should parse it again. Oh, I see, it's -λ multiplied by some term involving ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about what this interaction implies. 

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to determine which decay channels are kinematically allowed. Kinematically allowed means that the mass of X must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because when a particle decays into two particles, the rest mass of each must be less than half the mass of the original particle, considering conservation of energy.

Wait, but wait, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So I need to consider the possible fermions that satisfy 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV, since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. 

So the question is: which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

I remember the approximate masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

- Electron (e): very light, about 0.0005 GeV. Negligible, so definitely allowed.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV, so also allowed.
- Tau (τ): much heavier, around 1.77 GeV. So 1.77 < 3, so allowed.
- Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Wait, the masses vary. Let me think. The up and down quarks are light, maybe around a few MeV each. So their mass is negligible compared to 3 GeV. The strange quark is heavier, around 100 MeV or so. Still way under 3 GeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV. That's under 3, so allowed. The bottom quark is much heavier, about 4.7 GeV. Wait, no, wait: that's when considering the mass of the b quark. Let me get this right. I think the mass of the bottom quark is around 4.5 to 5 GeV. Oh, wait, but if the X is 6 GeV, then for decay into b quarks, each b would have to be about 3 GeV, but the actual mass is higher. Wait, no. Wait, the X is
