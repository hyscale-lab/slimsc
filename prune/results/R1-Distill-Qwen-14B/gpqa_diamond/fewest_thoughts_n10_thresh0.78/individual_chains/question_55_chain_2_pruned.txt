Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. So first, I need to understand what the structures of these compounds look like and how their NMR spectra would appear.

Looking at the NMR data given: 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). Let me think about each of these signals.

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm. Singlets usually mean that the protons don't have any neighboring protons. A singlet with 3H suggests maybe a methyl group attached to something that doesn't allow splitting, like an oxygen. Oh wait, acetate esters have the structure OAc, where the acetate is O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Acetate is O-CO-OCH3. Because acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. So the methyl group from the acetate would be a singlet because it's attached to the carbonyl carbon. So that 2.1 ppm peak is probably the acetate methyl group. So that's the OCH3 in the acetate.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet with 3H. A doublet suggests two neighboring protons. 3H as a doublet might be a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2 or a CH group. Since it's a doublet, maybe it's attached to a CH that has two neighbors? Wait, for example, if it's a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal coupling? Not sure yet. Maybe it's part of the propenyl or butenyl group.

Then, the 5.5 ppm signal is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). Hmm, that's a bit more complex. 5.5 ppm is in the range for vinyl protons (protons attached to double bonds). So maybe this is a proton on a double bond, perhaps in an allyl or vinyl group. The splitting into a dq suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Let me think: if a proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, like in a trans or cis configuration.

And the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16.0 Hz. 16 Hz is a relatively large coupling constant, which is typical for coupling between protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. So that must be a trans coupling because cis coupling usually has lower J values, but wait, I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the coupling between protons on a double bond (vicinal coupling) is usually around 10-18 Hz. So 16 is definitely a vicinal coupling, so those protons are on adjacent carbons in a double bond.

So putting it together, the structure must have a double bond with two protons, one of which is at 7.0 ppm as a d (doublet), and the other as the 5.5 ppm signal with more splitting.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like an allyl group attached to the acetate. Let me think about the options: the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Let me consider each option:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: The structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3 but wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but as an ester, perhaps it's CH2CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH3-O-CO-CH2CH=CH2? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, no, the acetate is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, the propenyl group is attached to the oxygen. So it's O-CO-OCH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no: the ester would be R-O-CO-R', where R is the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the propenyl group is attached to oxygen.

Wait, but that's propenyl acetate: the propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3? Or CH3-O-CO-CH2CH=CH2? No, I think it's the latter. Because the ester functional group is O-CO-O, so the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again: the ester is formed from an acid and an alcohol. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) would esterify with an alcohol. So if the alcohol is propenyl alcohol, CH2=CHCH2OH, then the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Similarly, the butenyl acetate would be similar but with a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

So, structures:

- Cis-propenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3, where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the configuration is cis (but wait, propenyl is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond, so it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc). Wait, that's actually prop-1-enyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structures. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the given data, there's a doublet at 7 ppm (J=16), which is probably a proton on the double bond. The 5.5 ppm is another proton on the double bond, perhaps.

In the structure of the ester, the propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-O-) would have the double bond between the first and second carbons. So the protons on the double bond would be the CH2 and the CH.

Wait, but in propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, no, C1 is CH2, so the protons there are (CH2) connected to O. But wait, in that case, the CH2 group is next to the oxygen, so it's a CH2-O- group.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the protons on the double bond are on the second carbon (the CH) and the first (the CH2). Hmm, that can't be right because the first carbon in the propenyl group is CH2 connected to O.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Propenyl group is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-.

So, propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

So in this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The CH2 is on C1, and the CH is on C2. The CH2 is connected to O
