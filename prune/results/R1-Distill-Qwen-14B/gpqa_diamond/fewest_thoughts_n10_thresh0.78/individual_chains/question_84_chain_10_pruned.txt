Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function using fractional approximation. The options are A to D, each related to different mathematical concepts.

First, I remember that when dealing with heat equations, finite difference methods are used to discretize the partial differential equations. Higher-order approximations mean that the method is more accurate but might be more computationally intensive. Parallel splitting probably refers to techniques that allow the problem to be divided into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously, hence speeding up the computation.

The matrix exponential comes into play when solving systems of linear equations, especially those that arise from time-dependent PDEs. Matrix exponentials are often involved in the solution methods, especially in methods like the exponential time differencing or when using certain splitting techniques.

In sequential algorithms, the computations are done step by step. To make them parallel, we need to split the problem into parts that don't interfere with each other. This is where things like domain decomposition or operator splitting might be used. But how does this relate to the matrix exponential?

Fractional approximation might be a method used to approximate the matrix exponential more efficiently. I think fractional approximation methods, like using Padé approximants, can provide a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. These approximations often involve rational functions, which might have properties that help in parallelizing the algorithm.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: This is important for ensuring that the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. However, stability is more about whether the method works correctly, not necessarily about making it parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions can complicate the problem, but I'm not sure how they directly tie into parallelism. Maybe if the boundary conditions are nonlocal, it affects how the problem is split, but I'm not sure if this is the key factor.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations, such as those used in Padé methods, might have properties related to their roots. If the approximation's denominator has complex roots, the matrix might be diagonalizable or have certain symmetries that allow for parallel decomposition. For example, if the eigenvalues are such that the matrix can be split into independent parts, that could enable parallel computation.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fractions are used to decompose complex fractions into simpler terms, which can then be computed more efficiently. If the approximation can be broken down into a sum of simpler functions, each of which can be computed independently, that would facilitate parallel processing. For example, if the matrix exponential can be expressed as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices, each part could be handled by a separate processor.

Wait, another thought: the matrix exponential can be written as exp(A), where A is a matrix. If we can decompose A into a sum of matrices that commute, then exp(A) can be expressed as a product of exponentials of those matrices. However, I'm not sure if that's the same as a linear partial fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the fractional approximation allows the matrix to be diagonalized or simplified in a way that each component can be processed independently, which is ideal for parallel computing. 

But going back to the options, option D says linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. If the approximation can be split into linear parts, maybe that's the way to enable parallel computation. For example, if the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that don't interfere with each other, each term can be computed in parallel.

Another angle: the process of converting a sequential method into a parallel one often involves splitting the time or space into non
