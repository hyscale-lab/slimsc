Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A through D with different combinations.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n²) * E, where n is the quantum number. So each particle can occupy a state with n=1, 2, 3, etc., and their energy is proportional to the square of that number.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. But in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n and the spin. Oh wait, in 1D, the quantum state is determined by n and the spin (which can be +1/2 or -1/2). So each n can hold two particles, one with each spin.

So for four particles, they have to fill up the lowest available energy levels without overlapping. Let's think about how the states fill up.

The ground state would be the lowest energy possible. The first level (n=1) can hold two particles (each with opposite spins). The next level is n=2, which can also hold two particles. So if we have four particles, ground state would have n=1 filled with two particles, and n=2 filled with two particles. Hence, the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, but each particle is in a separate state. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of the energies of each particle. So for the ground state with two in n=1 and two in n=2, each contributes E*(1²) and E*(2²) respectively.

So let's calculate the ground state energy. Two particles in n=1: 2 * 1² E = 2E. Two in n=2: 2 * 2² E = 8E. So total E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, that's 10E. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. No, because each particle in the same n would have the same energy. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with spin up and down. Then the next two go into n=2, same logic. So each n=1 contributes 1E per particle, so two gives 2E. Each n=2 is 4E per, so two gives 8E. Total is 10E for the ground state. That's if all four particles are in the two lowest energy levels.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the particles are fermions and can't all be in the same state. So the ground state would be the lowest possible configuration where each has a unique set of quantum numbers. Wait, but in 1D, each state is determined by n and spin. So for n=1, two possible spins, so two particles. Similarly, n=2 can take two. So yes, four particles can be in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2) for a total energy of 2*(1²) + 2*(2²) = 2 + 8 = 10E. So ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but the options have ground state as 4E or 30E or 10E, etc. Wait, looking at the options:

Option C has ground state 4E, so that doesn't fit. Option B's ground state is 4E, which also isn't matching what I just thought. Option D's ground state is 10E. Option A's ground state is 30E, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the ground state. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each particle. The particles are fermions, so each must have a unique quantum state.

The lowest possible configuration is when the four particles occupy the lowest possible n and spin states.

Wait, but the particles are spin-1/2, so for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and spin down). So the possible states are:

n=1, spin up → E=1²E= E

n=1, spin down → E=E

n=2, spin up → E=4E

n=2, spin down → E=4E

n=3, spin up → 9E

n=3, spin down → 9E

n=4, ... etc.

So for four particles, the first four lowest energy states are:

n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So each of these contributes E and 4E.

So the total energy would be 2*E (for n=1) + 2*(4E) (for n=2) → 2E + 8E = 10E.

So the ground state of the system is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option D has the ground state as 10E. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E. Hmm, but that's the first three energies. Wait the question is about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the possible excited states.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible arrangement, which is all four particles in the lowest possible states. Then,
