Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product.

Let me first sketch the target molecule. The compound is ethan-1-one with a phenyl group substituted at the 1-position. The phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5: a bromine and a nitro group. So, the benzene ring has substituents in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, the numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1 (which is the same as position 2 in a benzene ring when looking at substituents), maybe? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the substituents' positions.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- something). So the structure is:

O
||
C-Phenyl group where phenyl has Br at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions are numbered such that the substituents are in the meta positions? Let me think: the point where the ketone is attached is position 1. Then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that. So, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and there's a Br at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. So, the substituents are meta to each other on the benzene ring.

So how do I get there starting from benzene? I need to perform a series of substitution reactions, probably through electrophilic substitution.

Let me think about the steps needed. The target molecule has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one), a bromine, and a nitro group attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene needs to undergo substitution reactions to get these groups.

The order of adding these groups is crucial because the directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent adds.

Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine (as a substituent) is a meta director as well. The ketone is an electron-withdrawing group and would also be a meta director. However, when the substituent is a strong activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions.

Wait, but the ketone group is a meta director. So if I have a ketone group attached, the next substitution would be at the meta position. Similarly, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating, meaning they deactivate the ring, making substitution harder but directing meta.

Bromine is ortho/para director when it's an activating group, but wait, bromine is a deactivating group (because it's an electron-withdrawing via induction) but it is ortho/para directing because it has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance (though it's more about the inductive effect here).

Wait, no. Actually, substituents can be either activating or deactivating and either ortho/para or meta directors. Let me correct that: 

- Activating groups (like -NH2, -O- (in ethers), -OH, alkyl groups) are ortho/para directors because they donate electrons, making the ring more reactive and directing incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

- Deactivating groups (like nitro (-NO2), carbonyl (-COOH, -COOR, etc.), sulfonic acid groups) are meta directors because they withdraw electrons, making the ring less reactive and directing incoming electrophiles to meta positions.

So, the ketone group (like a carbonyl) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Nitro is also a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine (as in Br2 addition) is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group because the Br atom is an electron-withdrawing via induction but can donate electrons through resonance (though in reality, the inductive effect dominates, making it deactivating but ortho/para directing).

Wait, no, I think I have this mixed up. For a bromine substituent attached to the benzene ring, it's actually an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because the inductive effect (-I) is stronger than the resonance effect (+R). So, the overall effect is deactivating, but the directing is ortho/para.

So, let's plan how to add these substituents. Since the target has nitro, bromine, and a ketone. Let me see: which substituent is added first, second, third.

Wait, but the ketone is an ethan-1-one group, so perhaps it's an acetyl group. So, how do you introduce an acetyl group onto benzene? Through Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts requires the benzene ring to be activated, as the acylium ion is a strong electrophile. So, the ring must be activated (like having activating substituents) to undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation.

But if I add a nitro group first, that would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So maybe the acylation should be done before adding deactivating groups.

Wait, that's a key point. The order matters because once you add a deactivating group, the ring becomes less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, if I add the acetyl group (Friedel-Crafts) first, then the ring is activated (since acyl groups are meta directors but the ring is activated only if the substituent is activating. Wait, noâ€”the acyl group is deactivating, so adding it first would make the ring less reactive for subsequent substitutions. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is possible only on an activated benzene ring. That is, the ring must be activated towards electrophilic substitution. So if I have a benzene ring that's already been activated by an activating group, then Friedel-Crafts can proceed. But if I add a deactivating group first, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the acylation is done after adding activating groups, but in this problem, the target molecule has no activating groups; all substituents are deactivating.

So this suggests that the acylation must occur early when the ring is still relatively activated.

Wait, but benzene is not very reactive for Friedel-Crafts unless it's strongly activated. So maybe I need to add an activating group first, do the Friedel-Crafts, then add the deactivating groups.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are Br and nitro, which are deactivating. So perhaps the acylation needs to be done before adding any deactivating groups.

Alternatively, maybe the order is: first acylation (Friedel-Crafts), then nitration, then bromination. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ring needs to be activated. Benzene itself is not very reactive for Friedel-Crafts unless it's strongly activated. For example, if I have a methyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para director, then benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see any step that adds a methyl group. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Steps i) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation), iv) HNO3 (another nitration?), v) Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, perhaps the key is to determine the correct order of nitration, bromination, and acylation so that the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Wait, the target molecule has substituents at 3 and 5 positions on the benzene ring when the acetyl is attached at position 1. So the acetyl is at position 1, nitro at 5, and Br at 3.

So, the benzene ring would look like:

1 (acetyl)
|
3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) substituents.

So, the acetyl is at position 1. Then, the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl. The Br is at position
