Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions, specifically starting with cyclohexanone and going through several transformations. And the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm.

Alright, let me break down each step one by one. I think I'll need to draw the structures as I go along to visualize what's happening. So, starting with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group, so the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group.

The first reaction is treatment with bromine. Wait, cyclohexanone reacting with bromine... Oh, right! That's probably an addition reaction. Cyclohexanone has a ketone, and when you add bromine (Br2) in a dihalogenation, it likely adds across the carbonyl group. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Oh, wait, noâ€”adding bromine to a ketone would typically lead to the formation of a dibromide. So the ketone group (C=O) becomes C-Br2, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably adding across the carbonyl group. Let me think. Oh, I think it forms a bromohydrin, but wait, no, bromine in a different solvent? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation via a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: bromine can undergo addition to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a vicinal dibromide. But wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group, which is an electrophilic site. So when bromine (Br2) is added in a diaddition, it would add across the double bond. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond; it's a ketone. Oh wait, maybe it's a bromination via a different pathway. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a bromoketone? Or maybe it's an enolate formation? No, that's with bases.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, cyclohexanone can undergo a haloform reaction, but that requires multiple halogenations. Wait, the haloform reaction typically uses X2 (like I2 or Br2) in basic conditions
