Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, let me think about what exactly the question is asking.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ which is equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). They're asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors like (1,1,0), (0,0,1), etc.

Wait a minute, I think I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of a qubit state, where any state can be written as a vector (x, y, z) such that x² + y² + z² = 1. So the density matrix must relate to this somehow.

But how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector? Oh right! For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. For a mixed state, it's more complicated, but the given ρ seems like a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors each multiplied by 1/2 — so it's a classical mixture of the |0> and |1> states.

Wait, the general form of a density matrix for a mixed state of two pure states might be written as ρ = p |0><0| + (1-p)|1><1|, right? So in this case, p is 1/2, so it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>.

Now, the Bloch vector for a mixed state that's a classical mixture of |0> and |1> would be a combination of their Bloch vectors. The |0> state is at (1,0,0) on the Bloch sphere, and |1> is at (-1,0,0), I think. Because the Bloch sphere has the z-axis corresponding to the σ_z operator, so |0> is along +z and |1> is along -z.

So when you take a 50-50 mixture of these two, what does the Bloch vector become? Let me think. Each state contributes to the density matrix in terms of their Bloch vectors. The density matrix ρ can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector r as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let's write that out. The density matrix for a state with Bloch vector r is:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So, for our given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let's compute it.

First, I know that |0><0| is (I + σ_z)/2, because:

|0> = [1, 0]^T, so |0><0| = [[1,0],[0,0]]
Similarly, σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so (I + σ_z)/2 is [[(1+1)/2, 0], [0, (0-1)/2]] which would be [[1,0],[0, 0.5]] but wait, no, wait. Wait, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and (I + σ_z)/2 is (1/2)([[1,0],[0,1]] + [[1,0],[0,-1]]) )= [[1,0],[0,0]], which matches.
