Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ions attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right?

Wait, but wait. The options mention percentages, so I think I need to calculate the fraction of Co in each possible complex and then sum them up. Then, the percentage would be the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex multiplied by 100.

So, the possible complexes are Co(SCN)_1^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4^4- I suppose? Wait, no, the charge on Co(II) would change with the number of SCN^- ions. Let's think: Co^2+ with n SCN^- would have a charge of 2 - n*(−1) each SCN is −1. Wait no, wait: SCN^- is a monoanion. So each SCN contributes -1. So if Co is +2, and each SCN is -1:

Co(SCN)_n would have a charge of 2+ - n*(−1) → 2+ + n. Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula for the complex would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). So Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- is −1. So for n SCN, the total charge would be +2 - n*(−1) → Wait no, wait: each SCN is a ligand contributing -1. So the overall charge would be +2 - n*(-1) → +2 + n.

Wait, but that can't be right because the charge on the complex depends on how many SCN it has. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ would have n=1: 2+ + (−1) = +1? Wait, not exactly.

Wait, the charge of the complex ion is calculated as the charge of the metal plus the sum of the charges of the ligands. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{m}, m = charge of Co + n*(charge of SCN). Since Co is Co^2+ (charge +2), and each SCN is −1, so m = 2 + n*(-1) = 2 - n. So the charge is 2 - n. Which would be positive for n=1 (charge +1), n=2 (charge 0), n=3 (charge -1), n=4 (charge -2). But I'm not sure if all these complexes are possible here, but the problem gives four stability constants, so I guess all four complexes exist.

The stability constant βn is
