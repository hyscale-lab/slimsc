Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³ or 0.040 L. 

The dilution formula is C1V1 = C2V2, right? So C2 = (C1V1)/(V1 + V2). Wait, no, more accurately, the moles of acetic acid remain the same, so:

Moles of acetic acid before dilution = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. So we're adding NaOH to the acetic acid. The reaction should be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will equal moles of acetic acid. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach that point.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume (V) needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point being reached yet. It's about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. Since the equivalence point is at 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, that's where the 25% titration mark is.

Wait, but wait, actually, 25% titration might refer to 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized. Let me clarify. Oh, wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So 25% of that volume would mean 25% of the NaOH needed for equivalence has been added. So yeah, 2.5 cm³ added.

So, for the 25% titration point (which is also known as the first equivalence point if you're considering in terms of stoichiometry), we have to calculate the pH at this point. Similarly, we need to find the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the pH at 25% titration (2.5 cm³ NaOH added).

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). So the solution is a buffer solution containing both acetic acid and acetate ions.

To find the pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

But wait, let's make sure I get the concentrations right.

So, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.025 * 0.
