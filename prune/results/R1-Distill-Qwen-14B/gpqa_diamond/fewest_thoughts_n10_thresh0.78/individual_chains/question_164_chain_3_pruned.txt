Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read it again.

Alright, the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periodsâ€”the time between two primary eclipses. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. So system_1 takes twice as long to orbit as system_2.

Then, they mention spectroscopic observations showing radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. And the mass of each system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Wait, so how do I approach this? I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to detect the Doppler shifts caused by the stars orbiting their common center of mass. The amplitude of the RV curve depends on the mass of the companion. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it's moving less in the system.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass. Because the more massive star will have a smaller orbit around the center of mass. So the less massive star moves more, hence higher RV amplitude. So the star with the higher RV amplitude is the less massive one.

Right, so the primary star (the brighter one) usually has a smaller RV amplitude because it's more massive. But here, we have both stars' amplitudes given. So for system_1, star A has 10 km/s, star B 5 km/s. So their masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M_A / M_B = V_B / V_A. Wait, no, because according to Kepler's third law for binary systems, the mass function relates the velocities. Or perhaps a better approach is to consider the mass ratio.

The mass ratio (q) is q = M_secondary / M_primary. And the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So V_primary / V_secondary = M_secondary / M_primary = q. So V_primary = q * V_secondary.

Wait, let me think. If M1 and M2 are the masses of the
