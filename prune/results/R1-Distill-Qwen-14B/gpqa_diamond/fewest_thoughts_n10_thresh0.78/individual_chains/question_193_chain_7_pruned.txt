Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given relation is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Oh wait, wait, no, actually, it's written as 1 over plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Or is it (1/plx)^5? Wait, the way it's written is "1/plx^5", which I think is 1 divided by plx^5, so N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. The formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So if I solve for r, r = 1/plx. That makes sense.

So the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance (r). So I need to relate N to r.

First, express N in terms of plx. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Then, substituting plx with 1/r, since plx = 1/r.

So plx = 1/r → 1/plx = r. So when I substitute, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (1/plx)^5, which is r^5.
