Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². So the force here follows Hooke's law, which makes sense because the potential is quadratic in r.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. I need to find which option is correct from A to D.

Wait, so first, let's think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in 3D, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), or sometimes written as E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Because it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, but wait, I think in 3D, another way to write the energy is E = ħω (2n_r + l + 3/2), but that's when considering the radial and angular momentum parts. Or is that for the hydrogen atom? Because for harmonic oscillator, it's a different approach. Oh right, for the 3D harmonic oscillator, each direction contributes a quantum number. So each quantum number in x, y, z directions are n_x, n_y, n_z, all non-negative integers. The total energy is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Now, the energy depends on the sum n. So for the ground state, n=0, E = (3/2) ħω. First excited state would be n=1, E=(5/2) ħω. Second excited would be n=2: E=(7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3: E=(9/2) ħω. So the energy should be (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, options A and C have this energy. So the first part is either A or C.

Now the second part is the number of eigenfunctions, or the degeneracy, for this energy level. The degeneracy in 3D harmonic oscillator comes from the number of ways n_x + n_y + n_z can sum to a particular n. So for n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there where each is a non-negative integer and their sum is 3.

I think the formula for the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2), but wait, no, that's for the number of ways in two variables. Wait, for three variables, the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (
