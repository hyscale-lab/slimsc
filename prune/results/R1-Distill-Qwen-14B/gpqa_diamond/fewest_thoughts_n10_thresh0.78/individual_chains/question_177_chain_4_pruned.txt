Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Alright, let's see what the problem says.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2's. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger for Star_1.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = (b) / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9e-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Could there be any other factors? No, because Wien's Law for black bodies directly ties peak wavelength to temperature. So same λ implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Now, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the question is about the stars' intrinsic properties, so when calculating luminosity, we should consider the actual temperature, not the observed due to Doppler shift. Because when we compute luminosity using black body radiation, it's based on their rest frame properties.

Wait, but the question says that the stars are radiating as black bodies, and the astronomers computed their luminosities. So perhaps the radial velocities are a red herring for this part of the calculation. Because for luminosity calculation, it's about the intrinsic properties (radius, temperature), and the Doppler shift affects observed quantities like brightness and wavelength, but the actual luminosity is an intrinsic property.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same. But because of the Doppler effect, their actual temperatures might be different. Oh, because if a star is moving towards us, its emitted wavelengths would be blueshifted, and vice versa.

Wait, but the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 (so no Doppler shift) and 700 km/s for Star_2. Let me think: if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light would be redshifted. So the observed wavelength of maximum emission (λ_max observed) would be longer than the intrinsic λ_max. But in the problem, they say that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So if Star_1 has zero radial velocity, its observed λ_max is equal to its intrinsic λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is moving away, so
