Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down each step and see what we can figure out.

First, let's list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones.

Let me think about each reaction and what functional groups are involved.

Starting with compound A. When it reacts with HCN, it produces B. HCN is typically used in the formation of cyanohydrins or maybe nitrile compounds. But wait, the reaction of a carbonyl with HCN usually gives a cyanohydrin—so if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a ketone and a cyanide group attached. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, but then the product would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about what each step does. Let's consider the overall process.

Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst, so this is hydrogenation. If B has a nitrile group, upon hydrogenation, it would become an amine? No, wait, nitriles (CN) when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst like Pd become amines (CH2NH2, but if it's under more specific conditions, maybe it's a primary amine). Alternatively, if B has a ketone group, but then the hydrogenation would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but if A is a ketone, B would have a cyanide group. Let's see.

So, let me outline the possible structures step by step.

Let’s consider the first step: A + HCN → B.

Assume A is a ketone. The reaction of a ketone with HCN forms a cyanohydrin. So, the product B would have a hydroxyl group and a cyano group attached to the same carbon. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be cyclopentane-1,2-diol cyanohydrin or something like that. Wait, no. Cyanohydrin formation adds a hydroxyl and a cyano group to the same carbon as the carbonyl. So, if A is a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone, B would be a cyanohydrin—so a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons? Or wait, the cyanohydrin adds both groups to the same carbon where the carbonyl was. So, for cyclohexanone, the product would have an OH and CN on the same carbon, making it a secondary alcohol and a nitrile.

Then, when B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd), the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but under what conditions? Wait, Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Nitriles (RCN) upon
