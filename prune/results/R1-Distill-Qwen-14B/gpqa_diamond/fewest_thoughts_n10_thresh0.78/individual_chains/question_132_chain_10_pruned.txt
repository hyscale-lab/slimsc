Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

First, I need to figure out what each of these compounds looks like and their expected NMR signals.

Starting with the aromatic region: 6.7 ppm. Aromatic protons usually appear between 6.5-8.5 ppm. So two singlets here, each integrating for a certain number of protons.

Wait, but each compound has a 1:1 ratio, so the two signals at 6.7 each must come from each compound. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Let me think about each option's structures.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

The first has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, benzene has six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions. So maybe it's like 1,2,3,4-tetra, which leaves positions 5 and 6 free. Wait, no, wait, the first compound is 1,2,3,4â€”so adjacent positions 1,2,3,4. The second is 1,2,3,5.

Wait, the first compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene): four methyl groups in a row. So the structure would have two adjacent pairs. Let me draw it mentally. Positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the benzene would have methyl groups on adjacent carbons. So the structure is like 1,2,3,4-tetra. So when you have four methyl groups in a row, what does the aromatic
