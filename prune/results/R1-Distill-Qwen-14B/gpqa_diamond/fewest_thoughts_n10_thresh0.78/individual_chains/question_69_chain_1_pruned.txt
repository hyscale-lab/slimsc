Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The formula is tau = gamma * tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the resolution needed? Oh right, the resolution probably refers to the minimum distance the particles need to travel for the decay to be observed. Because in the bubble chamber, the decay products are detected when they ionize the chamber's medium. So, if the decay occurs too far apart, maybe it's hard to detect, or if they move too quickly, they might not ionize enough, but I think that's more about detection efficiency. Wait no, the problem is about the minimum resolution, which I think relates to how close the decay points need to be detected so that we can see the decay happened.

But wait, if the particles are moving quickly, they will travel a longer distance before decaying, so the decay length has to be small enough for the chamber to capture it. Alternatively, if the lifetime is longer, they can move further. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, but in the lab frame, tau is longer. The lifetime determines how much distance the particles can cover before decaying. So the distance is v * tau. But to observe the decay, the particles must decay within a certain distance so that their paths can be distinguished. If the decay occurs too far, the two particles' paths would be too close together, making it hard to resolve. So the resolution is about how well the chamber can detect if the decay happened or not, which depends on the decay length.

Ah, right, the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the decay length is too long, the particles move apart more, but perhaps if the resolution is too low, you can't tell if they originated from the same point. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe the problem is asking about the minimum possible decay length needed for at least 30% of the decays to occur within a certain distance, which the chamber can resolve.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So, the resolution is the smallest distance that can be measured (like the detector's spatial resolution). We need that 30% of the decays happen within a certain distance so that the detector can see them. Or perhaps the opposite: the number of decays that happen within a certain length is 30%; the detector can observe those. So maybe we need to find the length L such that 30% of the particles decay within L, and
