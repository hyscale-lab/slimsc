Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The compound in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me draw that structure mentally. Wait, maybe it's easier if I count the number of each type of bond in the molecule because the problem gives me bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I can use Hess's Law here, which involves calculating the bond energies in the reactants and products.

Wait, but wait. To find the enthalpy of formation, I might need to calculate the difference between the bond energies of the reactants (the elements) and the products (the compound). But wait, the problem gives bond energies for various C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H bonds. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Atomization is the process of breaking bonds in an element to form isolated atoms.

So, maybe I should think about the formation of this molecule from its constituent elements, which are carbon and hydrogen. So, the reaction would be something like C
