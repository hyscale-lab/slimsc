Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, each involving a different Michael addition. I'll need to figure out the products for each, and then match them with the options given.

Starting with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH to form product A. Okay, so I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically enolate, but sometimes other nucleophiles can act as well.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile in Michael reactions because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. When treated with a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it deprotonates to form the enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon, making it a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that is CH₂=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let's think. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be p-tolyl attached to the middle carbon of the acrylate. So it's CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. So structure would be CH₂-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO- substituents, so when it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(OOCH3)-CH(p-tolyl)? No, wait. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, maybe not. Let me get this right. The acrylate group is CH₂=CHCOO-; so numbering the carbons as 1, 2, 3: 1 is the first CH₂, 2 is the double bond CH, 3 is the COO- group.

So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the p-tolyl is on the third carbon. Wait, but the third carbon is part of the carbonyl. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the substituent is on the alpha position. Maybe the structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait
