Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value for an observable. Alright, let's break it down.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors in a Hilbert space, and they need to be normalized, right? So first thing I should check is whether this state is normalized. Because if not, I'll have to normalize it before proceeding.

The state vector is a 3-dimensional vector since there are three components. To find its norm, I'll calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. So let's compute that:

(-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

So the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. So I need to normalize this state. The normalized state would be the original vector divided by sqrt(6).

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Maybe I should just proceed because the observable is calculated using the given state regardless. Or perhaps the given state is already normalized? Let me double-check. The squared values add up to 6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. Hmm, but maybe the observable's eigenvalues and eigenvectors are such that the state's normalization doesn't affect the probabilities? Or perhaps it's given as a state vector regardless of normalization, but I think in practice, we always normalize. So I think I should proceed with the normalized vector.

Wait, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. To find this probability, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0. Then, the probability will be the square of the amplitude (the inner product) of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 with the state vector.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me recall. For an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Then, check if 0 is one of them. If it is, find the corresponding eigenvector. Then, compute the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector, square its magnitude, and that's the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the observable's matrix P is diagonal? Wait, no, looking at the matrix P:

Row 1:
