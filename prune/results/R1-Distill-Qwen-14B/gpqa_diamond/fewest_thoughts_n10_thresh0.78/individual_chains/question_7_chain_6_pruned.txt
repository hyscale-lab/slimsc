Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, the question is about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by this process. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs.

Let me start by recalling what I know about this. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has photons with a certain energy, and these can interact with high-energy gamma-rays. When a gamma-ray with enough energy interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. This process is called photon-photon annihilation.

So the problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. I remember that the energy density of the CMB is a key factor in determining the interaction rates. Also, the process is probably limited by the inverse Compton scattering or something similar, but wait, no, this is a different process.

Wait, the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into e+ e- is probably the thing I need. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction. I think the cross-section increases as the center-of-mass energy increases. So when the energy is high enough, the interaction becomes more likely.

The lifetime of the gamma-ray is determined by the probability of this interaction. The mean lifetime would be the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate depends on the cross-section, the flux of CMB photons, and the velocity of the gamma-ray. But since we're dealing with high-energy gamma-rays, their velocities are close to the speed of light, so maybe I can approximate that as c.

The interaction rate per unit volume would be the product of the cross-section (σ), the CMB photon density (n), and the relative velocity (v). So the rate Γ is roughly σ * n * v.

Now, the cross-section for this process depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. The center-of-mass energy (s) squared would be (E_gamma + E_CMB)^2, but since E_CMB is much smaller than E_gamma (given that E_CMB is about 1e-3 eV and the gamma-rays are in the GeV range), E_gamma ≈ E_gamma.

Wait, no, actually, E_gamma is much higher. Let me think: E_gamma is on the order of GeV, which is like 1e9 eV, and E_CMB is 1e-3 eV. So E_gamma is about 1e12 times higher. So when calculating the center-of-mass energy, the CMB photon's energy is negligible compared to the gamma's. So the approximate center-of-mass energy is about the gamma's energy.

But wait, to be precise, the cross-section for e+ e- production when a gamma and a photon collide is given by the formula σ ≈ (4π/3) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (y^2) / (1 + y^2), where y is the ratio of the two photon energies. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Another approach: the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by σ = (4π α^2)/(3 m_e^2) * (E1 E2)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy squared. Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the threshold condition.

The threshold for pair production is when the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c^2. So the minimum energy for the two photons is when they are each at least m_e c^2. But in our case, one photon (the CMB) is much lower energy than the gamma-ray.

Wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma, so the combined energy is dominated by the gamma. So the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E_gamma + E_photon)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_photon c)^2 ) ), but since E_photon is much less than E_gamma, we can approximate sqrt(s) ≈ E_gamma.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the condition when the two photons can produce an electron-positron pair. The condition is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c^2.

But since the CMB photon energy is much lower than the gamma, the minimum condition is that the gamma's energy E_gamma must be at least m_e c^2. But that's always true for gamma-rays, right? So probably, the cross-section starts becoming significant once the gamma has enough energy to interact with the CMB photons to reach the threshold.

Wait, maybe I should think about the cross-section scaling with energy. For photon-photon interactions, the cross-section is proportional to (E1 E2)/(s),
