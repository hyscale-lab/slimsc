Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I guess I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Wait, but wait, some of these are strong acids and bases, while others are weak. So I have to handle them differently.

Let me list out the components:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. 
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely.
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

So the plan is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution, then see if they neutralize each other. If not, determine what's left and find the pH based on the excess.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Let me calculate the moles for each component.

First, for CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, I can't just multiply by H+; I'll have to handle that separately after neutralization.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume=400 mL=0.4 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 *0.4=0.08 moles. Since it's a strong acid, it will donate 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity=0.3 M, volume=300 mL=0
