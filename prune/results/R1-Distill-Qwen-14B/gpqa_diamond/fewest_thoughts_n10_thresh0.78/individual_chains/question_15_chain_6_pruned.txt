Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts here, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets were already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, and both have the same mass. 

Wait, what's the RV method again? Oh right, radial velocity detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. But here, we don't need to worry about the RV method's specifics; we just know their masses and orbital periods.

So, Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. That means Planet_1 is much closer to its star since orbital period relates to the distance from the star (Kepler's third law). The shorter the period, the closer the planet is.

Both have circular orbits, which is important because eccentricity affects the probability of transit, but since both are circular, that part is the same for both.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So more massive star, same radius—maybe it's a younger star or a different spectral type, but I don't think that matters for the transit probability.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But more specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to edge-on relative to us. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_p / a) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so the probability simplifies. Wait, no, I think the formula for the probability is P = (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e²)) ) but since e=0, it's (R_* + R_p)^2 / a². Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Another approach: The probability of a planet transiting is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis (which is the distance a), but more accurately, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance (a). Or wait, the probability is roughly (R_* / a), but that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be aligned with our line of sight. For a randomly oriented orbit, the probability is proportional to (R_* / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I remember that for a circular orbit, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, no,
