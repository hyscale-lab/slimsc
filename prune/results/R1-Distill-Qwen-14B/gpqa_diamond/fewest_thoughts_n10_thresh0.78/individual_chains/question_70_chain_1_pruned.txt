Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions involving different compounds, and then determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are named based on their molecular structures, like tetrahedral, octahedral, etc. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I'll need to think through this.

Let me break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C also reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, used as a solvent.

So, I need to figure out what each of these compounds could be. Let's start with the reactions.

First, reaction 1: A + 8B → C. Since B is a gas and used in large equivalents, maybe it's something like O2 or another diatomic gas. Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. If A is a metal, maybe B is something like Cl2? Or maybe another diatomic gas.

Wait, another thought: If A is a metal and B is oxygen (O2), then reacting with 8 equivalents could form a metal oxide. But let's think about the color. C is bright red. Hmm, bright red products... I'm trying to remember which compounds are bright red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but maybe not bright red. Oh! Maybe it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, think about other compounds. Oh wait, maybe C is sulfur trioxide (but that's colorless). Alternatively, perhaps it's a different oxide.

Wait, another approach: reaction 3 says that C reacts with water to give A plus two acids, F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or HNO2.

So when C (which is a solid) reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. That suggests that C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. One strong, one weak. So maybe C is a sulfite or something else.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a metal sulfide, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into a strong acid and a weak acid. Let's think about what salt could do that.

Wait, what if C is a nitrate of some sort. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate of a metal, but when it reacts with water, it doesn't produce two acids.

Wait, another angle: reaction 4 says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. If D and B are gases reacting to form a solvent, perhaps D is CO2 and B is something else? Or maybe D is something like H2O?

Wait, B is a gas. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H
