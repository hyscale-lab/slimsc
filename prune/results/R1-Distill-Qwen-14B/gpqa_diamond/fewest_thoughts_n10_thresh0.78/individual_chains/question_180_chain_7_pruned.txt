Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out which one is right.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges depends on their configuration. Since the system is isolated, we're probably dealing with electric potential energy. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but wait, this is a system of multiple charges. So each charge contributes to the potential energy based on its interaction with every other charge. But how do I calculate the total potential energy for a system with multiple charges?

Oh right! For a system of multiple point charges, the total electric potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So I need to calculate all the possible pairs and add them up.

But wait, in this case, there's a charge fixed at point P (let's call this charge Q), and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from Q. 

So maybe I should split the problem into two parts:

1. The potential energy between Q and each of the 12 charges.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Because each of the 12 charges is at the same distance from Q, the first part should be manageable. And for the second part, since all 12 are at the same distance from each other, perhaps arranged in some symmetrical way, like uniformly on a sphere or something. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, only that they're each 2 meters from P. So I guess they could
