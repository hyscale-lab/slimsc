Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, so the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But I remember that in solution, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The various K_a values will influence how much of each form is present.

So first, let's figure out the moles of each salt we have. Because both salts are sources of phosphate, but in different forms.

Starting with KH2PO4. The formula is K(H2PO4). So the molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that: 1/136.09 is approximately 0.007337 mol. Wait, no, 136.09 is about 136 g per mol, so 1g is about 0.00734 mol. So approximately 0.00734 mol of KH2PO4.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. That's about 0.00561 mol. Wait, let me be precise. 177.99 is approximately 178 g/mol. So 1g is 1/178 = approximately 0.0056179 mol. So roughly 0.005618 mol of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Wait, but what are these salts dissociating into?

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na+ and HPO4^2-. Wait, no, the formula Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water, but in solution, the 2H2O is just the water of crystallization and doesn't affect the ions. So the main ions are 2 Na+ per formula unit and HPO4^2-.

So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.00734 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005618 mol.

But wait a second, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So we
