Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about reactions involving solid A, gas B, product C, gas D, and others. And the final part is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that's related to molecular geometry and point groups. So I need to figure out what E is first, right?

Let me read the reactions again:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So A + 8B → C.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So C + H2O → A + F + G.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D + B → H.

I think I'll start by figuring out what each substance might be. Let's go one by one.

Looking at reaction 4: D + B → H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often something like water, alcohol, maybe something else. But since B is a gas, what gases react with other gases to form solvents? Maybe B is something like Cl2 (chlorine gas), but wait, D reacting with B in 1:1. Let me think. If B is Cl2, then perhaps D is something like NaOH? Wait, NaOH is a solid, though. Or maybe D is NH3? No, NH3 is a gas. Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, their reaction would form NH2Cl, but that's not a common solvent. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, another possibility: D is H2O, but then reacting with B. If B is Cl2, then H2O and Cl2 can react, but that usually forms HCl and HOCl. But that's a reaction in water. Wait, but in reaction 4, D and B form H, which is a solvent. So H could be something like hydrochloric acid, but that's not a solvent. Or maybe H is something else. Alternatively, maybe D is SO2 and B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, but I'm not sure. Another approach: considering reaction 3, where C reacts with water to form A and two acids. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces strong and weak acids. For example, if C is NaNO3, then it would hydrolyze to give HNO3 (strong) and maybe another acid? Wait, no, NaNO3 hydrolyzes to give HNO3 and NaOH, but that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if C is a nitrate salt of a metal that when hydrolyzed in water produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfite or sulfide? Wait, let me think about reaction 1: A + 8B → C. 8 equivalents is a lot. So maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, if A is copper (Cu), and B is Cl2, then 8 equivalents would form CuCl4^2-? Wait, but copper typically forms CuCl2 or CuCl4^2- depending on conditions. Let me check, for example, copper reacting with chlorine gas. The reaction is 2Cu + Cl2 → 2CuCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2. Oh wait, but if it's in excess Cl2 and under certain conditions, maybe it forms CuCl4^2-? Or maybe A is another metal.

Wait, another angle: product C is bright red. That's a clue. What compounds are bright red? Maybe something like Fe(OH)3, but that's usually reddish-brown. Wait, perhaps it's a nitrate or some other compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound? Or perhaps it's a sulfide? Wait, I'm not recalling a bright red solid immediately. 

Alternatively, let's think about reaction 3: when C is hydrolyzed, it forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So perhaps C is a nitrate (like KNO3 or Cu(NO3)2), which when hydrolyzed in water would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and maybe another acid. But wait, if C is a nitrate, then A would be the corresponding hydroxide? Or maybe C is a salt of a weak base and strong acid. Wait, for example, if C is NH4NO3, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid) and NH4OH (which is weak, so F would be HNO3, G would be NH4OH). But then A would be NH4OH, which is a liquid, not a solid. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, but sulfides usually react with water to produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But H2S is a weak acid, so maybe that's G, and F would be the other acid? Wait, but then A would be the metal hydroxide. So let me think: for example, if C is FeS, then FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 (which is A, a solid) and H2S (which is G, a weak acid). But where does F come into play? Because the reaction should produce two acids. Wait, but FeS is a sulfide. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2: when it reacts with water, it forms NH3 (a weak base, which would produce a weak acid when in water) and Ca(OH)2. But then F would be a strong acid? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: C is a nitrate salt. For example, suppose C is Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 (which is A, a solid) and HNO3 (a strong acid F) and maybe another product. Wait, but the reaction equation would be: Cu(NO3)2 + H2O → Cu(OH)2 + 2 HNO3. That would give F as HNO3 and G... Wait, that's only two products, but the question says two different acids. So perhaps the salt is something else.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed salt. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that produces two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, perhaps C is a sulfite or carbonate
