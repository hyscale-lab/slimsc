Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, right, expectation values. Okay, I think I know how to approach this.

First, I recall that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state vector. So for this problem, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz + 5σx) |ψ⟩.

I think I can break this down into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then I'll sum them up.

Let me write down the state ψ. ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2.

I remember that σz has eigenvalues for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Specifically, σz|↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value of σz for ψ would be |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1).

Wait, let me compute that first. |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the expectation of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) = -5. That's the first part.

Now for σx. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but rather the superpositions. So I can't directly say what σx does to |↑⟩ or |↓⟩. Instead, I think I need to compute the expectation value using the standard formula.

The operator σx is represented by the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So when you have a state ψ, the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it expressed in terms of probabilities and amplitudes. Let me think: for a spin-½ particle in state ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2Re(ab*), where Re is the real part. Wait, is that right? Or maybe another formula.

Wait, let me compute it explicitly. The expectation value ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

So ψ is [a, b]†, right? Because |↑⟩ is [1, 0], |↓⟩ is [0, 1
