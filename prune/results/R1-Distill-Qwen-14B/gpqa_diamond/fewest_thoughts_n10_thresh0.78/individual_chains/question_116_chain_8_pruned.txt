Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it slowly because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring Hs, and a quartet suggests three neighboring Hs.

So, the 0.9 ppm triplet for 6H makes me think of methyl groups attached to something. Since it's a triplet, each methyl is next to a CH2 group. Wait, but wait, 6H as a triplet—so maybe two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. Like maybe a (CH3)2CH group? Or perhaps a di-substituted structure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like two separate CH3 groups attached to the same carbon or adjacent carbons.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—quartet implies each H is next to a CH3 group, perhaps? Because quartet splitting is usually due to coupling with three equivalent protons. Wait, no, wait: each H in the quartet is next to a group with 3 Hs. So, if it's a quartet, each proton is adjacent to a CH2CH3? Like, maybe a CH2 adjacent to a CH3. Because, for example, in ethyl groups, the -CH2CH3 would have the CH2 as a quartet (split by the three Hs of the CH3). So for the quartet, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3.

Putting these together: Compound A has two sets of Hs. The triplet (6H) suggests two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. The quartet (4H) suggests two CH2 groups, each attached to
