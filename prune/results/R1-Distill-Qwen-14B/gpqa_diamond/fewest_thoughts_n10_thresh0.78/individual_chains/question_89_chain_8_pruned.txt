Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromo would mean bromines are on two bridgehead carbons that are opposite each other, I think.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. In such conditions, especially with dihalides, elimination reactions are common. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to an elimination product. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty bulky molecule. So perhaps when KOH is added, it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But because it's a dihalide, two elimination steps might happen, but wait, no, KOH in such conditions is more likely to cause one elimination. Or maybe two eliminations, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Hmm.

The product after KOH treatment is product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably a -OCH2- group. Because OCH2 is typically around 3.5-4.5 ppm. The integration is 2H, so it's likely a methylene next to an oxygen. Then the other peaks: 2.41-2.23 (10H), that's a lot of protons, probably from the adamantane structure, like CH2 groups. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2, maybe a bridgehead or something else.

The IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 has a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination would form a double bond, but then how does that relate to a carbonyl? Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. Wait, but dibromide plus KOH—could it be a nucleophilic substitution? Wait, but in a dihalide, substitution would require two steps. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric. So perhaps each bromide is replaced by an OH group. But that would give 1,3-diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's more like an epoxide or a ketone.

Wait, but if it's KOH, maybe it's a double elimination. Oh, wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could lead to a double elimination, forming an alkene. But then, how come the IR shows a carbonyl? Maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps there's another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double elimination, but perhaps it leads to a ketone. But how? Wait, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond, but in this case, they're on 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. Oh wait, in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are across from each other. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, but that would give 1,3-diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Wait, but the product's NMR has OCH2, which suggests an ether linkage. Wait, maybe KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an epoxide? But I thought epoxides come from dihalides with epoxidation. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, if you have a dihalide and you eliminate two equivalents of HBr, you could form an epoxide. But how? Oh, wait, the reaction of a dihalide with a base can form an epoxide. The base would deprotonate, and the two leaving groups (Br-) would leave, forming a double bond, but wait, that's elimination to form an alkene. Alternatively, for epoxide formation, you need an electrophilic oxygen. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. KOH has OH- ions. So, if the dihalide reacts with OH- in a substitution, but for each Br, you substitute with OH. So product 1 would be 1,3-diol. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which wouldn't be present in a diol. So that
