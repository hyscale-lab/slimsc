Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction uses 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

There are four options for reagents A and B, so I need to figure out which pair works for both reactions.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism typically involves the formation of an enolate or something similar because the ketone is a good electrophile.

Wait, but NaCN provides the CN- ion. So, in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is where the attack happens. The CN- would add to the carbonyl, but wait, if the carbonyl is attacked, won't that form a cyanohydrin? Oh right, yes. A cyanohydrin is formed when a nucleophile like CN- adds to a ketone, resulting in a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the adjacent carbon.

So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense because the ketone would be (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but how does the reaction proceed? I think it's a two-step process. The ketone first reacts with the cyanide ion. But wait, sometimes the reaction can be influenced by conditions like acidic or basic.

Wait, the reaction of ketones with HCN (or CN-) typically forms the cyanohydrin. But the reaction is usually done under basic or acidic conditions. Let me recall: In
