Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each energy level depends on the quantum numbers in each spatial direction. But wait, in 3D, the states are usually described using the principal quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, no, I think it's the other way around.

Wait, the 3D harmonic oscillator can be considered as three independent 1D oscillators (in x, y, z directions) due to the potential being separable. So the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Each n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

But wait, another approach is to use the quantum number n, which is the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy can be written as E = ħω (n + 3/2). So for each energy level, n can be 0,1,2,... etc. So n=0 is the ground state, n=1 is the first excited, n=2 the second, and so on.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. So let's clarify: the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy is E = ħω (3 + 3/2) = ħω (9/2). That gives (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, option A has this energy, and option C also has this energy. So the energy part is either A or C.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue for this state. Oh right, for a given n, the number of eigenfunctions is the number of ways you can write n as the sum of n_x + n_y + n_z, where each n_i is a non-negative integer.

Wait, that's a combinatorial problem. The number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that their sum is n. For n=3, it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.

I think the formula for the number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1), which is (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, that's (5 choose 2) = 10. Wait, is that right?

Yes, because for each dimension, the possible values are 0,1,2,3, etc. So for sum 3
