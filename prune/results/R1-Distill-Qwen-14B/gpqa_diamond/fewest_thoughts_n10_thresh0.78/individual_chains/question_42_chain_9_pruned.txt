Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're in a system, and their orbits are circular. Astronomers found the equilibrium temperatures ratios between them. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. Also, their mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's, given that all have an albedo of 0.3, which is like Earth's.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I recall is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the orbital distance, because the star's light spreads out over a larger area as you go further away. So, the temperature should go as T ∝ sqrt(L/(16πσ a²)) ), but maybe I can think in terms of ratios instead.

Wait, let's get back. The equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.25, but perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula T_eq = ( L (1 - a) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the orbital distance, a is the semi-major axis, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ and albedo (a) are the same for all. So, the equilibrium temperature would be proportional to (1/(a^2))^(1/4) ) = (1/a^(1/2)), so T ∝ 1/√a.

Wait, yes, because (1/(a²))^(1/4) is 1/a^(1/2). So, T ∝ 1/√a. So the ratio of the temperatures T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no, because T1 is proportional to 1/√a1, T2 to 1/√a2. So T1/T2 = (sqrt(a2)/sqrt(a1)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So if T1/T2 is given as 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
