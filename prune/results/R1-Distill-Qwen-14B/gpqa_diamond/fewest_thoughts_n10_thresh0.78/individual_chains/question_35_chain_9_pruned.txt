Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, okay, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Ay operator, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

First, I'll try to understand the setup. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So, S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
      [i, 0] ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and often used in spin operators. Oh wait, S here might be one of them. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me recall their forms. 

The σy matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which matches S exactly. So S is the Pauli matrix σy. That makes sense because the problem says S is a 2x2 matrix, which Pauli matrices are. 

So, the operator Ay is c * σy. Given that c is h/(4π), Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. 

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the equation Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Since S is σy, which is a Pauli matrix, I know that the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but with some factors. Wait, no, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by i for σy? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's compute the eigenvalues properly.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0. Since σy has eigenvalues ±i, let me check that. Wait, for the Pauli matrices, σx, σy, σz, each has eigenvalues ±1. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So σy is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real.

Wait, no, wait. σy is Hermitian because its conjugate transpose is equal to itself. Let me calculate σy's eigenvalues.

The matrix for σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, I compute the characteristic equation:

det(σy - λ I ) = 0

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -λ , -i ],
  [ i , -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i^2) 

But wait, i squared is -1, so determinant is λ² - (-1) = λ² +1 = 0. So λ² = -1 → λ = ±i. Oh wait, so the eigenvalues are i and -i.
