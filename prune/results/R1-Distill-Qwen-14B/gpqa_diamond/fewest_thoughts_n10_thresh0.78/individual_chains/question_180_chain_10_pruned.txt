Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an isolated system of particles with charge and calculating the minimum energy. I'm a bit rusty, but let me see.

Alright, so the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy contributions from them moving, I guess.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 13th is at the center, and the others are all on a sphere of radius 2 meters around it. Since they're constrained, I think they can't move closer or farther, so all are at that fixed distance.

The problem is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Energy in electrostatic systems is usually the potential energy between the charges, right? Because the system is isolated, I can ignore any external fields or work done by them. So I need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges.

Wait, but with 13 charges, how do I calculate this? I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for each pair of charges, I calculate U and then sum them all.

The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, since each pair is considered only once, I don't want to double-count, right. So how many pairs are there?

Total number of charges is 13. Each pair is two distinct charges. So the number of unique pairs is (13 choose 2). Let me compute that: 13*12/2 = 78 pairs. So 78 interactions.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters from P. So what about the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12? Each of those 12 is at 2 meters from P, so the distance between the fixed charge (at P) and each is 2 m.

But the other 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but what about the distance between any two of the 12? Are they all at the same distance from each other? Let's think: If each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, they are all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2m. The distance between any two charges on the sphere would be... hmm, depends on the angle between them. But wait, the question says the system is isolated, and the particles are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P.
