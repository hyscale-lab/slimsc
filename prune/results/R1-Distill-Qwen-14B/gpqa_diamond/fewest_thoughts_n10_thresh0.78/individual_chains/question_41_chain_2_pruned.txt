Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So I guess I need to account for both the glass's motion and the light's speed within it.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking: what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab?

The options are A to D, with B being 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. Hmm, but the glass is a medium, so normally light slows down in it. But wait, the glass is moving. Does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, I think I might be mixing up some concepts here. There's the refractive index which slows the light down, and then there's the medium's motion. I remember that when a medium moves, the speed of light in it as observed in the lab frame should consider both the medium's velocity and the light's velocity within the medium.

The speed of light in the medium (glass) is usually c/n. But when the medium is moving, perhaps I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula? Because if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light is moving at u in the glass’s frame, then in the lab frame, the speed is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and in this problem, c is taken as 1. So let me think in terms of units where c=1.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n = 1/n. Because the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n. So u = 1/n.

So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me make sure I get the directions right
