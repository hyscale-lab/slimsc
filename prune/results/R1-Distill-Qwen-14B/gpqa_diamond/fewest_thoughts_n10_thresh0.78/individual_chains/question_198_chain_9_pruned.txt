Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that when a metal ion like Co(II) is in solution with a ligand like SCN-, they form complexes. The stability constants (β) tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem gives me four stability constants: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, right? But here, β3 is the highest. So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)1, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4? Or wait, perhaps the numbering is different. I think the common complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n+, with n being the number of SCN- ligands. So β1 would be for the monomeric complex, β2 for the dimer, etc. Or maybe β1 is the first ionization step, like adding one SCN. Hmm, I need to clarify what the β values represent.

Wait, the stability constant β for a complex is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for each step, each additional ligand contributes to the overall β. So the overall β for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise βs. Or wait, no, the stepwise βs are for each addition. So the overall formation constant K for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. Or maybe each β is for the nth complex. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, the standard approach is that β1 is for the first complex, say Co(SCN). Then β2 would be for the second complex, Co(SCN)2, and so on. So the stability constant for Co(SCN)₂ would be β1 * β2. But wait, no, I think each β is the formation constant for the nth complex. So βn is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_n is the product of β1 through βn. Or wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe each β is the overall formation constant for a specific complex. Like, β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)₂, β3 for Co(SCN)₃, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄. So each β represents the overall K for that complex. That would make sense because the problem lists four βs, probably for complexes with 1 to 4 SCN- ligands.

So, the four complexes would be:

1. [Co(SCN)]⁺: β1 = 9
2. [Co(SCN)₂]⁰: β2 = 40
3. [Co(SCN)₃]^-: β3 = 63
4. [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β4 = 16

Wait, but the charges are a bit tricky. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So Co²+ plus n SCN⁻ would be Co(SCN)_n^(2 - n). So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But I'm probably getting ahead of myself. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN⁻ ligands. So that would be the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ complex, which is complex 2 with β2=40.

Wait, but the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". I think the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, which is the dithiocyanato. So the problem is to find the fraction of this complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, relative to all cobalt species.

But how do I approach this? I think I need to calculate the distribution of each cobalt species based on their stability constants and find the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex.

Since the solution contains Co²+ and SCN⁻, there's a series of complexes formed, each with a different number of SCN⁻ ligands. The distribution of these complexes depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻.

The general approach is to consider all the possible complexes and calculate their relative concentrations. The percentage is the mole fraction of the desired complex (dithiocyanato) multiplied by 100.

But wait, there are four complexes, so I need to calculate their concentrations and sum them up. The key is to compute the fraction each complex contributes to the total.

I think I should consider the formation of each complex step by step. Let me outline the steps:

1. Start with the most stable complex. The highest β would indicate which complex is dominant. But wait, since each β is for a specific complex, the overall stability of higher complexes depends on the product of the βs. Wait no, each β is the overall stability for that specific complex. Or am I getting that wrong?

Wait, no. I think each β is the stepwise formation constant. For example, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the formation constant
