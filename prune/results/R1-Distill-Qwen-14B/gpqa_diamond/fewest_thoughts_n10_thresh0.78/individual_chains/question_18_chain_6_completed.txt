Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if that matters for this particular question. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method. The data given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the photospheric composition of the Sun includes 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si,Star1 / n_Si,Star2).

First, I should remember what these abundance notations mean. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Which simplifies to log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X_sun/n_Y_sun)) ) = log( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) )

Wait, actually, the general formula is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ), right? So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X to Y compared to the Sun's.

So, let's break down the data.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log( (n_Fe/n_H)_star / (n_Fe/n_H)_sun ) ) = 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_star = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun. Because [Si/Fe] = log( (n_Si/n_Fe)_star / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) ) = 0.3, so (n_Si/n_Fe)_star = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But wait, I also have the Sun's data. The Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] would be... Well, we don't have [Si/Fe]_sun given, but perhaps we can compute it from the given data.

The Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, the Sun's nMg/nH is 10^(-5), because 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Wait, let's calculate that:

Sun's nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = 3.16e-5 (since 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-5 is 0.00001, so halfway between 4 and 5 is 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5).

Similarly, nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, the Fe/H ratio is the same as Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as Sun, which is 3.16e-5.

Next, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, (n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

We can compute (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun from the Sun's data. Since n_Si isn't given, but we have nMg/nH and other ratios. Hmm, maybe I should express all in terms of H and then relate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express each element's abundance in terms of H, and then find the ratio of Si in each star.

Let me think. For each star, I can express n_Si, n_Fe, n_Mg, etc., in terms of n_H. Because the ratios are relative to H.

Let me start with the Sun's data.

Sun: 

n_Fe/n_H = 3.16e-5 → n_Fe = 3.16e-5 * n_H.

n_Mg/n_H = 1e-5 → n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H.

We don't have n_Si, but perhaps we can find it using [Mg/Si]_2, but wait, that's given for Star_2. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 dex. So for Star_2, the Mg/Si ratio is higher than the Sun's by a factor of 10^0.3. So, (n_Mg/n_Si)_star2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But I don't know (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si] in terms of [Mg/H] and [Si/H], because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

Because:

[Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg/n_Si) - log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) ) 

= log( (n_Mg / n_Si) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) )

= log( (n_Mg/(n_Si)) * (n_Si_sun /n_Mg_sun) )

= log( (n_Mg/n_Si) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )

Which can also be written as [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H], because:

[Mg/H] = log(n_Mg/n_H) - log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun)

Similarly, [Si/H] = log(n_Si/n_H) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun)

So, [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]

Wait, let me check that:

n_Mg/n_Si = (n_Mg/n_H) / (n_Si/n_H) ) → [Mg/Si]_star = log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_star / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) )

Which is log( (n_Mg/n_H)_star / (n_Si/n_H)_star ) / ( (n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) )

Which is log( (n_Mg/n_H)_star * (n_Si_H_sun) ) / ( (n_Si/n_H)_star * (n_Mg_H_sun) ) )

Alternatively, it's [Mg/H]_star - [Si/H]_star - ([Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun )

Because [Mg/H] is log(nMg/nH) - log_sun, so for the star, [Mg/Si] would be ([Mg/H]_star - [Si/H]_star) - ([Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun) ) = ([Mg/H]_star - [Mg/H]_sun ) - ([Si/H]_star - [Si/H]_sun )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of each star.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log( (Fe/H)_1 / (Fe/H)_sun ) ) = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun = 3.16e-5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log( (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun ) ) = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

We can compute (Si/Fe)_sun from the Sun's data. Wait, but the Sun's data gives n_Fe and n_Mg but not n_Si.

Hmm. So perhaps I need to express everything in terms of H.

Let me define for each element X, [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun / n_H_sun )

But since the Sun's n_H is a constant, perhaps I can calculate the ratios.

For the Sun:

n_Fe = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

We are to find n_Si_sun. Hmm, perhaps I can find it from the given [Mg/Si] for Star_2, but that's a bit circular.

Wait, perhaps for Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0. So let's first process Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun → 1e-5.

Wait, no: [Mg/H] is log( (n_Mg/n_H) / (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) ) ) =0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) → same as Sun.

But wait, the Sun's n_Mg/n_H is 1e-5, so for Star_2, n_Mg/n_H is also 1e-5.

So, n_Mg = 1e-5 * n_H for Star_2.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )

We can rearrange to find n_Si in Star_2.

n_Si_2 = n_Mg_2 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) )

But wait, n_Mg_sun is 1e-5 * n_H_sun, and n_Si_sun is what we need to find. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express n_Si in terms of Mg and the ratio.

Wait, perhaps we can express everything in terms of the Sun's n_Si.

Let me denote:

For the Sun:

n_Fe = 3.16e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Mg =1e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun is unknown, but perhaps we can relate through Star_2's [Mg/Si].

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3. So:

log( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3 → (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun )

But n_Mg_2 is 1e-5 * n_H_2, since [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg_2 =1e-5 * n_H_2.

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 * n_H_2 ) / ( 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) )

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun)) ) * n_H_2

But n_Mg_sun is 1e-5 * n_H_sun, so:

n_Si_2 = (1e-5 / (10^0.3 * ( (1e-5 *n_H_sun) / n_Si_sun )) )) * n_H_2

Hmm, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I can instead express n_Si in terms of the Sun's n_Si.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express all ratios in terms of H.

Let me try to approach each star separately.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun )

Wait, because (Fe/H)_1 = (n_Fe1 / n_H1) / (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) =1 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

(Si/Fe)_1 = (n_Si1 /n_Fe1 ) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun ) ) = 10^0.3.

So,

(n_Si1 /n_Fe1 ) =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun )

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) * n_H1 → so,

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe1

But n_Fe1 is (n_Fe_sun ) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )

Wait, perhaps substituting that:

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) * (n_Fe_sun * n_H1 /n_H_sun )

Simplify: n_Fe_sun cancels. So,

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun ) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )

Wait, so n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun ) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )

But I don't know what n_H1 is relative to n_H_sun. Do I have any information about the overall abundance or the star's composition? Or perhaps, since the question is about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, the H factor might cancel out.

Wait, because when I take the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2, the n_H factors might cancel.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to compute n_Si for both stars and then take the ratio.

Let's try Star_1 first.

Star_1:

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

n_Si1 = (n_Si_sun) * (n_H1/n_H_sun ) * 10^0.3

Wait, from earlier.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 /n_H_sun )

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg2 /n_Si2 ) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun )

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Mg2 ) / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) )

Substituting n_Mg2 from [Mg/H] data:

n_Si2 = (n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun )) / (10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) )

Simplify:

n_Si2 = (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) would be:

[ 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun ) * (n_H1/n_H_sun ) ) ] / [ (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun ) / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

(n_Si1 /n_Si2 ) = [ 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun ) * (n_H1/n_H_sun ) ] * [ 10^0.3 / ( (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun ) ) ]

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

The numerator is:

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun )

Denominator is:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / 10^0.3

So, the ratio is:

(10^0.3 * n_Si_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun )) / ( (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) )

Cancel terms:

n_Si_sun cancels.

(n_H1 /n_H_sun ) / (n_H2 /n_H_sun ) ) → (n_H1 /n_H2 )

10^0.3 / ( 1 /10^0.3 ) ) → 10^0.3 * 10^0.3 = 10^0.6.

So, the ratio becomes:

(10^0.6 ) * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2. Wait, but both stars are in LTE, and using the EW method for elemental abundances, but I don't think that affects the hydrogen quantity. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that both stars have the same number of H atoms? Or perhaps not, because they have different masses. Wait, but their masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but I don't know how that relates to the number of hydrogen atoms. The mass depends on the total number of particles (if all are H, but heavier elements contribute less), but I don't think we can directly relate the mass to the number of H atoms without knowing the composition.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of n_H in each star is determined by their overall metallicity. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars. But no, that's probably not a valid assumption.

Hmm, I'm stuck here because I don't have enough data to find n_H1/n_H2. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of silicon is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = (n_Si1 /n_H1 ) / (n_Si2 /n_H2 ) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Which is [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 + log(n_H2/n_H1 )

Wait, but I don't know [Si/H] for Star_2. Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star using the given data.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H] =0, and [Si/Fe]=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 = 0 +0.3=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H] =0, and [Mg/Si]=0.3.

So, [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H] for Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-(-0.3)} } = 10^{0.3} / 10^{0.3} )=1.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_H1) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )=0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3: log(n_Si2/n_H2) - log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun )= -0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) = 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} } =10^{0.6}.

Because:

(n_Si1/n_H1) = (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{0.3}

(n_Si2/n_H2 )= (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *10^{-0.3}

So, (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) )= 10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}.

Thus, (n_Si1/n_H1 ) = 10^{0.6} * (n_Si2/n_H2 ).

But the ratio we need is (n_Si1)/(n_Si2) = [ (n_Si1/n_H1 ) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si2/n_H2 ) *n_H2 ] 

= (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

So, (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) =10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, this doesn't help. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio of H atoms is determined by the overall abundances. Or perhaps, given that the stars are in LTE and we're using the EW method, the H abundance doesn't change? Or maybe the problem assumes that the total number of H atoms is the same for both stars, but I don't think that's a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H is determined by the star's metallicity. Wait, no, because metallicity is about elements heavier than He, and H is the main component.

Wait, another thought: the mass of the star is given. But the number of H atoms depends on the star's mass and composition. But without knowing how much of the mass comes from H, I can't compute n_H1 and n_H2.

Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that the total number of hydrogen atoms is the same in both stars? That might not be a correct assumption, but maybe that's what the question expects.

If that's the case, then n_H1 =n_H2 → (n_Si1/n_Si2 )=10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So that would be the answer.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident if this assumption is correct. Because the stars have different masses, their total number of H atoms would likely be different.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the definition of the abundance in terms of number density.

The problem gives [Fe/H]_1 =0, which means Fe abundance in Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, so Mg is same as Sun.

But for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3, meaning that Si is more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun by 10^0.3.

But how does that translate to the overall abundance of Si?

Wait, [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 → 0 +0.3=0.3. So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3, which is [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2=-0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2 )=10^0.3 /10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}.

But n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H2/n_H1 )

I don't know this factor. Hmm.

Wait, but all the options are scalar values, so perhaps the H factors cancel out, or are considered the same. Because if the stars have the same metallicity, perhaps their H abundances are the same. Or perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H variation, assuming that the [X/H] is relative to the Sun's H, so the H in each star is scaled accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the Si abundance in each star relative to the Sun, and then find the ratio.

Let me think:

Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{ [Si/H]_1 } = n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Star_2:

n_Si2 = n_Si_sun * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 } = n_Si_sun * 10^{-0.3}.

So, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

So that would be approximately 4. But the options have option A as ~3.9, which is close.

But wait, why is this approach ignoring the H scaling? Because the [X/H] already accounts for the H abundance in each star.

Wait, perhaps because [X/H] is defined as log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X_sun/n_H_sun ), so n_X = (n_X_sun * 10^{[X/H]} ) * (n_H /n_H_sun )

So, n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

n_Si2 = n_Si_sun * 10^{-0.3} * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

So, the ratio:

(n_Si1/n_Si2 ) = (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But again, without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, we can't compute this.

Wait, unless I'm supposed to assume that the number of H atoms is the same in both stars. Because in that case, n_H1 =n_H2 → ratio is 10^{0.6}.

But why would the H number be the same? Well, perhaps the problem expects that, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same as the Sun, but that seems unlikely because stars can have different metallicities.

Wait, let's consider that the number of H atoms is proportional to the star's mass, but that's probably not correct because the mass includes all elements. But given that the masses are given, perhaps we can use the mass to find the ratio.

Wait, but I don't see how mass relates to the number of H atoms. If a star has more mass, it could have more H, but if it's more evolved, perhaps it's lost H. But without knowing the exact composition, I can't make that connection.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think differently. The problem gives [Fe/H]_1=0, which means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0.

So, for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_H1/n_H_sun )

For Star_2:

n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

n_Si2 =n_Si_sun *10^{-0.3} * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

Ratio:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^{0.3} * n_H1 ) / (10^{-0.3} *n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Hmm, but without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't compute this.

Wait, but perhaps the mass of the star is related to the number of protons, assuming that the mass is dominated by H and He. Let's see: the mass of a star can be approximated as the sum of the masses of each element: M ≈ sum(m_X * n_X), where m_X is the mass per particle.

But H has a mass of about 1 u, He about 4 u, etc. But without knowing the composition, it's hard to make a connection between mass and n_H.

Alternatively, perhaps each star has the same number of H atoms, but that's an assumption I can't justify.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the H scaling factor and just take the ratio of [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, which would give 10^{0.6}.

But why? Because [Si/H] is the logarithm of (n_Si/n_H), so the ratio is 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Wait, (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2 )=10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Which in this case is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}.

So, the ratio of (n_Si1/n_H1 )/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) is 10^{0.6}.

But the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms, n_Si1/n_Si2.

Which is (n_Si1/n_H1 *n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 *n_H2 )

= (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2 ) * (n_H1/n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But again, without knowing (n_H1/n_H2 ), I can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe the ratio of H atoms is the same as the ratio of the star's masses. That is, n_H1/n_H2 = M1/M2.

Because if each star is mostly H, then the number of H atoms is proportional to mass.

So, n_H1/n_H2 = (M1)/(M2) =1.5 /1.2 =5/4=1.25.

So, putting it all together:

n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^{0.6} *1.25 ≈3.98 *1.25=4.975.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, this doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H atoms is inversely proportional to the metallicity. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2 ) is 10^{0.6} (about 3.98), which is option A.

Perhaps the question assumes that the H abundance is the same for both stars (n_H1 =n_H2 ), hence the ratio is 10^{0.6}.

But why would n_H be the same? Because the stars have different masses, but perhaps the problem expects you to ignore that and just take the [Si/H] into account.

Given that, the answer would be approximately 3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident because the H scaling could affect the result, but without more data, I think that's the intended approach.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Definitions and Data:
1. **[X/Y] notation**:  
   \[
   [\text{X/Y}] = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{X}}/n_{\text{Y}}}{n_{\text{X, sun}}/n_{\text{Y, sun}}}\right)
   \]
   where \(n_{\text{X}}\) and \(n_{\text{Y}}\) are the number densities of elements X and Y in the star, and \(n_{\text{X, sun}}\) and \(n_{\text{Y, sun}}\) are their solar values.

2. **Given abundances**:
   - For Star_1:
     - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\): The Fe/H ratio is the same as in the Sun.
     - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\): The Si/Fe ratio in Star_1 is \(10^{0.3}\) times that in the Sun.
   - For Star_2:
     - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\): The Mg/H ratio is the same as in the Sun.
     - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\): The Mg/Si ratio in Star_2 is \(10^{0.3}\) times that in the Sun.

3. **Solar composition**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5\).

### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Each Star
Using the relationships between abundance ratios:
- For Star_1:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Fe/H}]_1 + [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3
  \]
  This means \((n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}}\).

- For Star_2:
  \[
  [\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = [\text{Mg/H}]_2 - [\text{Si/H}]_2 \implies 0.3 = 0 - [\text{Si/H}]_2
  \]
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3
  \]
  This means \((n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_2}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}}\).

### Step 2: Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon number densities is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si, Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si, Star_2}}} = \frac{(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_1}}}{(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Star_2}}}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \((n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})\) in terms of solar values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si, Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si, Star_2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{Sun}}}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si, Star_1}}}{n_{\text{Si, Star_2}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Step 3: Interpretation of Options
The closest option to the calculated ratio \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\) is **A) ~3.9**.

### Conclusion
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
