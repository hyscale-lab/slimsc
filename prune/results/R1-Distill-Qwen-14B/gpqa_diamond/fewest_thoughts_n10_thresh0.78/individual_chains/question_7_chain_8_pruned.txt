Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with CMB photons. Hmm, let me start by understanding what's going on here. The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons, producing electron-positron pairs.

Wait, so the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. Right, and the CMB is a background of photons with a certain energy. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. The problem is asking what energy the gamma-rays must have so that their lifetime is limited by this process. I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions and maybe something called the optical depth or the probability of such an interaction.

I remember that the lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to the annihilation rate. The annihilation rate would depend on the cross-section of the interaction and the density of the target photons. So, if the rate is high, the lifetime is short because the gamma-rays are annihilating quickly.

The cross-section for pair production (γγ → e+e-) is probably important here. I think there's a formula for the cross-section when a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy photon. The cross-section might depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the target photon's energy.

Wait, the CMB photon has energy E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. Let me denote the gamma-ray energy as E. So the gamma has energy E, and the CMB photon has E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

The cross-section for pair production, σ, can be approximated. I think for this process, the cross-section increases as the energy increases, but there's a threshold. The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy for an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so for pair production, each photon must have enough energy such that their sum meets this threshold. But wait, in this case, the CMB photon is low energy, so the gamma must be sufficiently high to meet the threshold.

Wait, but wait. The process requires that the sum of the energies of the two photons is at least 2m_e c², because each electron has rest mass m_e c². So the threshold condition is E_gamma + E_c
