Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, labeled A to D, each with a series of steps. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully through each step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. The molecule is a benzene ring with three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2, and nitro in position 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. For benzene rings, the numbering goes in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So in 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So it's a meta arrangement between nitro and ethoxy, but wait, actually, let's think about their positions. Let's imagine the benzene ring with positions 1, 2, 3 in a clockwise manner. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the substituents. The target has three groups: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. The substituents' positions are 1, 2, and 3, so they are adjacent. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the synthesis starts from benzene. Each option gives a series of reactions. The reactions involved are likely electrophilic substitutions, such as nitration, sulfonation, alkylation, etc.

I need to figure out the order of introducing these substituents. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups already present on the ring. Each substituent will direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions.

So, the substituents we have are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2). Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director) because it's an electron-donating group (being an ether). Nitro is a deactivating group (meta director) because it's an electron-withdrawing group. The tert-butyl group is an activating, bulky alkyl group, which is an ortho/para director but bulky, so it tends to direct incoming groups more to the para position if possible but can be influenced by steric factors.

Wait, but since the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, the order of adding them would affect where the next group goes. Let me think about the order in which these groups are added.

I think the key is to determine which group is introduced first, second, third, considering their directing effects. Also, some reactions may require certain conditions, like whether nitration is done before or after sulfonation, because sulfonic acid groups are strong
