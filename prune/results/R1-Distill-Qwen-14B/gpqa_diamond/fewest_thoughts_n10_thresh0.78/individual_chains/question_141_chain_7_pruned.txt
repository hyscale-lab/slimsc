Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-dâ€”I think that's another way of writing o-bromobenzene. So the bromine is attached to the benzene ring in the ortho position relative to another substituent. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the formula written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, no, that might actually be 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So the substituents are a bromine and a deuterium on adjacent carbons.

So the structure would be benzene with Br on carbon 1 and D (deuterium) on carbon 2. So, adjacent to each other. Now, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, and in such conditions, especially when using a dehydrohalogenation, it can lead to elimination reactions, forming alkenes.

Wait, but wait a second. Benzene is a stable aromatic compound. So when a halogen is attached, like bromobenzene, under certain conditions it can undergo elimination. But wait, elimination usually requires a leaving group and adjacent H's. But in benzene rings, the substituents are on the aromatic ring, so how would
