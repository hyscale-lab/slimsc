Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |psi><psi|), and mixed states are statistical ensembles, hence the density matrix being a convex combination of projectors.

Wait, wait, the given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Oh right, that's a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So rho is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because the diagonal entries are both 1/2, and the off-diagonal are zero. Right, because |0><0| has 1 in (0,0) and 0 elsewhere, and same for |1><1|. Adding them gives 1 in (0,0) and (1,1), and zeros elsewhere. Multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal entry is 0.5, and off-diagonal are zero.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, for a single qubit state, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (like coordinates) with magnitude <=1. So when r is (0,0,0), rho is I/2, which is the completely mixed state. That's exactly what our rho is because (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 equals I/2.

Wait, let me write that down. The identity matrix I for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So (I)/2 is diag(0.5, 0.5), which matches our rho. So in Bloch sphere terms, r must be (0,0,0) because when r is zero, the density matrix is I/2.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option B is (0,0,1), which would correspond to rho = (I + |0><0| - |1><1| )/2, which would have diagonal entries (1,0)/2 and (0,1)/2 added to the identity, wait no, wait, the general form is (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2. So when z is 1, the diagonal would be 1/2 + 1/2 *1 and 1/2 -1/2 *1, so (1,0). But our rho has both diagonal entries equal to 0.5, so all x, y, z must be zero.

So the correct position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is in a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. The density matrix can also be written as \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. 

In the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector with magnitude \(\leq 1\) and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. When \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\), the density matrix simplifies to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. This matches the given \(\rho\) exactly, as both diagonal entries are \(0.5\), and the off-diagonal entries are zero.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) and **Option D** (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) correspond to mixed states with non-zero components, which do not match the given \(\rho\).
- **Option B** (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) corresponds to a density matrix with unequal diagonal entries, which also does not match \(\rho\).
- **Option C** (\(r = (0,0,0)\)) corresponds to \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which matches the given density matrix exactly.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
