Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means it has two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The ring itself is six-membered, so each substituent is on adjacent carbons or in some positions, but wait, the total number of carbons is 8. Oh wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons? Or maybe each substituent contributes some. Wait, let me calculate.

Wait, benzene is six carbons. The substituents would add more. So the di-substituted means two substituents attached, each possibly containing extra carbons. So the total is 8 carbons. So 8 -6 = 2 carbons in substituents. Or maybe one substituent has more than one carbon. Wait, but substituent groups can be like -OCH3, which is one substituent with one oxygen and three hydrogens but only one carbon. Hmm, maybe in this case, the substituents are each something that adds to the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Because the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and aromatic-halogen (like -X, where X is Cl, Br, etc.). So two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen.

Wait, but di-substituted benzene can have substituents in various positions. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl (C=O) stretch and an aromatic-halogen (like C-X). So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but wait: a carbonyl group would be something like -CO- or -COOR, or a ketone, or an aldehyde. Or maybe a carbonyl in an aromatic substituent, like a carbony
