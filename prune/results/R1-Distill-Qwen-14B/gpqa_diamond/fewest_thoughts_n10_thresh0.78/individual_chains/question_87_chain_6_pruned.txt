Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X).

Hmm, let's break this down. So, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents on the benzene. The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents. Each substituent would contribute a certain number of carbons.

Wait, the substituents: one of them is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, maybe. But wait, wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so that substituent is probably an acyl group, like a ketone (C=O) or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes have higher wavenumber in IR. Also, di-substituted benzene rings with substituents in either para or ortho positions would have different NMR signals.

But let me think about the substituents. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. So benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents. Let me calculate the carbons in substituents.

Wait, substituents could be groups attached to the benzene. Let's say each substituent has a certain number of carbons. For example, one substituent is a carbonyl group, which could be like a ketone (like -CO-R), and the other substituent might be something else, like a halogen, maybe. Wait, but the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait a second. The IR has peaks for both carbonyl and aromatic halogen. So two substituents: one is -X (halogen), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. So what could the substituents be?

Another possibility is that one substituent is a ketone (like -CO-R), and the other is a halogen. Let me count the carbons. The
