Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about expectation values for a spin-half particle. Spin-half, so like electrons I guess. The state is given as a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The particle is in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operator is 10σz +5σx. Oh, right, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices for spin in the z and x directions, respectively. The expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So expectation values are linear, right? So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx should be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier because I can calculate each expectation value separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. 

The state is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me denote this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. 

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Because when you measure σz, the state collapses to |↑⟩ with probability |a|^2 and to |↓⟩ with probability |b|^2. So the average would be the weighted sum of the eigenvalues.

Calculating |a|^2: (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|^2: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Next, I need to compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier because its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. I recall that σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value directly using the definition.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Let me write out σx. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, in terms of the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, σx is represented by this matrix.

So, ψ is [a, b] = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Let me compute ψ† σx ψ. Wait, but actually, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector [a*, b*], where * denotes complex conjugation. But since the coefficients are real here, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying ψ† * σx gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Then, multiply this by ψ:

[sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T ?

Wait, let me get that right. No, wait. When you multiply a row vector on the left by a matrix, you get a row vector. Then, multiplying by the column vector ψ should give a scalar.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value using the formula:

⟨σx⟩ = (a a* + b b*) when considering the operator? No, wait, no. Let's think about it. The expectation value is ψ† σx ψ.

Let me compute it step by step.

σx in matrix form is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

So, the state ψ is a column vector [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, σx ψ is [b; a] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† σx ψ = [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

Since a and b are real, their complex conjugates are the same. So, ψ† σx ψ = a b + b a = 2ab.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check. So, σx is applied to ψ, giving
