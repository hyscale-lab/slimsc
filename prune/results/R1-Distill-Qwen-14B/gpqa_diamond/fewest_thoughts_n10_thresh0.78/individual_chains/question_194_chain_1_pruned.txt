Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, so it's a model where each pair of spins interacts with each other. The Hamiltonian is like the negative J times the sum of the products of each pair.

The goal is to find the partition function Z. The partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and compute the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.

Each spin has two options, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list all the possible states and compute E for each.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Because the spins are symmetric, maybe I can group them by the number of +1 and -1 spins or something like that.

Wait, each spin can be ±1, so the state is determined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). Let's think about the possible values of S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, because that's what's in the energy.

Let me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.

Wait, so E = -J H, so the exponential term in the partition function would be exp( β J H ), because Z is sum exp( -β E ) = sum exp( β J H ).

So, for each possible state, compute H, and then exp(β J H). Then sum all those terms.

So the first thing is to find all possible values of H for all 8 states.

Let's list all possible states. Since each spin is ±1, the 8 states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Okay, let's compute H for each.

1. State 1: all +1. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. H=1+1+1=3.

2. State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S
