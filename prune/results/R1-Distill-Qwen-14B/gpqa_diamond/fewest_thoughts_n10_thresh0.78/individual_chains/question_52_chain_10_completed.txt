Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm. It's about stars, their effective temperatures, spots, and something about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

So, let me break it down. The star has some parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait, how does that happen? Spots are cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the star, the total observed Teff would decrease because a fraction of the surface is emitting less. But in this question, the change in Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So they've already computed that, and I don't need to calculate it again.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots. The problem states that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet or maybe extreme ultraviolet? Wait, 1448 angstroms is about 144 nm, which is in the vacuum UV, I think. So probably not something we can observe from the ground, but in space telescopes maybe.

The question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. I remember from the Boltzmann equation that the ratio of populations in two energy levels depends on temperature and the energy difference between the levels. The formula is (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy. But wait, the exact ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference. Here, level 1 is probably the lower energy level, and level 2 is the higher one, so E2 > E1.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler. So when the star has spots, part of the surface is at a lower temperature. But the question says to examine the ratio in the stellar photosphere. Hmm. Wait, the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light. So when spots cover parts of the photosphere, those regions are cooler. But how does this affect the overall photosphere? Or are we assuming that each part of the photosphere is at a certain temperature? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K? Or maybe the spots are 5500 K and the rest are 6000 K. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere when the star has spots. Alternatively, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when there are spots. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when the star has spots, the average Teff is lower. Maybe the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions, but the problem is probably treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when there are spots. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's how to approach it.

So, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels (n1 and n2), when there are no spots, is higher than when there are spots. Because when Teff is lower, the ratio decreases.

The factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio_without_spots) / (ratio_with_spots). So, I need to compute this factor.

Wait, the ratio is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So, the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T. Because when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. So, when Teff is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K), the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K. Since the ratio is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) / exp( (E2-E1)/(k T') ), where T is 6000 and T' is 5500.

But wait, I need to compute the ratio (n2/n1) for both temperatures, then take their ratio.

So, the factor is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T') ) ] ) = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T' - 1/T) )

Because (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so when you take the ratio, the (g2/g1) cancels out, and you're left with the exponential term.

So, the factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spot - 1/T_clear) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. Without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K.

(n2/n1)_clear / (n2/n1)_spots = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_clear) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spot) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_clear) - 1/(T_spot) ] )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, no, because 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative, which would make the exponent negative, so the ratio would be less than 1. But wait, the factor is clear over spots. So if the ratio decreases when there are spots, the ratio (clear ratio)/(spot ratio) is greater than 1. So, in this case, the exponent would have to be positive.

Wait, let's double-check. Without spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K). So (ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. So exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is larger. So (n2/n1)_clear is higher than (n2/n1)_spots. So when we take (clear)/(spots), it's larger than one. So the factor is greater than 1.

So, let me compute the exponent:

ΔE/(k) [1/T_clear - 1/T_spot] = (ΔE/k)(1/6000 - 1/5500) = (ΔE/k) * (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) )

Which is (ΔE/k) * (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = (ΔE/k) * (-1/66,000 )

Wait, that gives a negative exponent, so exp(negative) is less than 1. So the ratio would be exp(negative), which is less than 1, implying that (n2/n1)_clear is less than (n2/n1)_spots, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent. Let's think again. The formula for (n2/n1) is [g2/g1] * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, for a higher T, the exponent is less negative, so exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So, higher T leads to higher (n2/n1). So, when T is 6000 K, (n2/n1) is higher than when T is 5500 K. So, without spots, the ratio is higher.

So, the factor is (n2/n1)_clear / (n2/n1)_spots = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spot - 1/T_clear ) )

Because (n2/n1)_clear = [g2/g1] exp( -ΔE/(k *6000) )

(n2/n1)_spots = [g2/g1] exp( -ΔE/(k *5500) )

Dividing, [g2/g1] cancels, and we get exp( [ -ΔE/(6000k) + ΔE/(5500k) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Yes, that makes sense. Because 1/5500 is bigger than 1/6000, so the exponent is positive, so the ratio is greater than one, which aligns with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So the factor by which the ratio changes (clear over spots) is exp( (ΔE/k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Now, I need to compute this exponential term. But I don't know ΔE. However, I can compute it using the wavelength given. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448 angstroms or 1.448e-7 meters.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is wavelength.

So, ΔE = hc/λ.

Compute ΔE:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.448e-7

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m

So ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, that's per photon. Since each atom's energy level transition corresponds to a photon of this energy, so the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/λ.

Now, let's compute this energy in terms of eV or something more manageable, perhaps? Because k (Boltzmann's constant) is often in eV/K.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So perhaps it's better to calculate ΔE in eV.

Compute ΔE in eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1e-10 m) ? Wait, no, wait. 1 Å is 1e-10 m, so 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 m, as I had before.

So, ΔE in J is 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So,

ΔE (eV) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s.

hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ=1448e-10 m (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m). Wait, no, 1448 Å is 1.448e-7 meters. So,

ΔE = hc/λ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Yes, same as before.

So, ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon. Now, in eV, that's 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV. So about 8.57 eV.

Hmm, that seems quite high. Wait, but 1448 angstroms is in the near UV, right? So the energy is higher than visible light, which is about 1.5-3 eV. So 8.5 eV is in the UV range. Okay, makes sense.

So, now, putting it into the exponent:

(ΔE / k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

First, compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000 ) = 1 / 66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So, the exponent is:

(ΔE / k) * 1.515e-5

ΔE is 8.57 eV, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So,

(8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) = approx (8.57 / 8.617e-5 ) K^{-1}.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, ΔE is 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (ΔE) / (k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ) ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approx 100,000 (exact calculation: 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 100,000 ish?)

Let me compute it:

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.57 * (1 / 0.00008617) ≈ 8.57 * 11602 ≈ approx 100,000.

Wait, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617. So 1/0.00008617 is about 11,602. So 8.57 * 11,602 ≈ 100,000.

So, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 K.

So, (ΔE / k ) = 1e5 K.

Now, multiply by (1.515e-5):

1e5 K * 1.515e-5 = 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515.

So, the exponent is 1.515.

So, the factor is exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^0.5 is about 1.648. Let's compute e^1.515.

Alternatively, 1.515 is approximately 1.5, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, e^1.5 is approximately 4.48.

But let me compute 1.515:

We can approximate as follows:

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504. Because ln(4)=1.386, ln(5)=1.609, so ln(4.5) is around 1.504.

So, e^1.504≈4.5.

Our exponent is 1.515, which is a bit higher. So, e^1.515 is about 4.5 * e^0.011.

e^0.011 ≈ 1 + 0.011 + (0.011)^2/2 ≈ 1.011 + 0.0000605 ≈ 1.01106.

So, 4.5 * 1.01106 ≈ 4.54977.

Approximately 4.55.

So, the factor is approximately 4.55. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which seems to match.

But let me check the calculations again. Because perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, back to the exponent calculation.

ΔE in eV is 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, (ΔE/k) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617.

Let me compute 8.57 / 0.00008617 precisely.

0.00008617 is approximately 8.617e-5.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = let's compute 8.57 / 8.617 = approx 1 (since 8.57 ≈8.617) → 0.994.

So, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 = 0.994 * 1e5 ≈ 99,400 ≈ 9.94e4.

Ah, so I had approximated 1e5, but it's actually about 9.94e4.

So,

(ΔE / k) = 9.94e4 K.

Now, (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(33e6) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 )= 5/(33000) ≈ 1.515e-4.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the (1/5500 - 1/6000) calculation.

Wait, 1/5500 is approximately 0.0001818, and 1/6000 is 0.00016667.

So, 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.

Which is 1.515e-5.

Ah, right. So,

(ΔE /k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )= (9.94e4) * (1.515e-5) )

Multiply 9.94e4 by 1.515e-5:

9.94e4 = 99,400.

1.515e-5 = 0.00001515.

99400 * 0.00001515 = ?

Let me compute 99400 * 0.00001515.

99400 = 9.94e4.

0.00001515 = 1.515e-5.

Multiply 9.94e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.94 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.94 * 1.515 ≈ Let's compute:

10 * 1.515 = 15.15.

But 9.94 is 0.06 less than 10, so 15.15 - (0.06 * 1.515) = 15.15 - 0.0909 = ~15.059.

So, 15.059 * 0.1 = 1.5059.

So, the exponent is approximately 1.506.

Hmm, wait, so the exponent is 1.506.

So, e^1.506 is about, let me think.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504, so e^1.504 ≈4.5.

Here, exponent is 1.506, which is a little higher, so e^1.506 ≈ 4.5 * e^0.002.

e^0.002 is approximately 1 + 0.002 + (0.002)^2/2 ≈ 1.002 + 0.000002 ≈1.002002.

So, 4.5 * 1.002 ≈4.509.

So, the factor is approximately 4.51, which is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So that should be the correct answer.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the populations depends exponentially on the inverse of the temperature.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{clear}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E \)
The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the transition wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The temperatures are \( T_{\text{clear}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The term \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{clear}}}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

First, compute \( \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \):

\[
\frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,400 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now multiply by \( 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
99,400 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.506.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.506).
\]

Using \( \exp(1.506) \approx 4.51 \). This matches option C, which is approximately 4.5.

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is approximately **4.5**.

Answer: C
