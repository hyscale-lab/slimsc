Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what product D is after a series of reactions. Let me look at the question again and try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 5-bromo-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I remember that these types of compounds are polycyclic, maybe something like a bicyclic system with multiple rings. 

The first reaction is with water, so probably a hydrolysis reaction. Bromides often undergo substitution reactions, like an SN2, but I'm not sure. Wait, the starting material is decahydro, so it's fully hydrogenated, meaning it's a bicyclic compound with all the hydrogen. So when it reacts with water, maybe it's a ring-opening or some kind of elimination? Oh, wait, if it's a bromide in a bicyclic system, maybe it's an example of a Friedel-Crafts type alkylation, but no, water would just remove the Br. Alternatively, it could be a di-elimination since there's a bridge.

Wait, another thought: the molecule has a bridge where the Br is attached. When it reacts with water, perhaps it undergoes an elimination step. Wait, no, I think that the addition of water would substitute the bromide. So the product A would be the corresponding alcohol. But wait, decahydro suggests that all the rings are hydrogenated, perhaps a ring is fully saturated. Maybe it's a norbornene derivative. 

Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure about the numbering here. Alternatively, cyclopenta fused with a cyclobutane ring? So the structure is a bit complex. But the first step is H2O, which probably substitutes Br to become an alcohol. So product A is 5-hydroxy-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydrocyclopenta[1,4]cyclobuta[1,2]benzene.

Next step, A is treated with PDC. PDC is pyridinium chlorochromate, which is a mild oxidizing agent. It's often used to oxidize alcohols. Primary alcohols to ketones? Wait, no.
