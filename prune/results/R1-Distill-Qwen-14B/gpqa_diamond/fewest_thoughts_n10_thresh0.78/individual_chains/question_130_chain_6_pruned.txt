Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting something using optical telescopes. Hmm, the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space and how they absorb light from background quasars. The wavelength mentioned is the Lyman alpha, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is at about 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Right, because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 * 0.1 = 121.6 nm.

So the question is about the redshift. Redshift is when light from a source is stretched to longer wavelengths because the source is moving away. The formula for redshift (z) is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. Or wait, no, maybe it's (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. Oh right, both give the same thing. So z = (λ_observed - λ_rest) / λ_rest.

The clouds absorb the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So if the quasar's light passes through a cloud that's moving away from us, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms. But wait, no, the quasar emits light. The hydrogen cloud between us and the quasar would absorb some of that light. So the quasar's light, when it reaches us, will have a part missing at the Lyman alpha wavelength, but if the cloud is moving, the wavelength we see the absorption at would be different.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects (the clouds) such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So the telescopes are optical, which means they can't see wavelengths beyond a certain point, probably into the infrared. Because for very high redshifts, the Lyman alpha line would be shifted into the infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't observe. So the lower limit would be the point where the Lyman alpha line is just at the edge of the optical range.

What's the typical cutoff for optical telescopes? I think the
