Okay, so I have this NMR question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Their molecular formula is C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, so I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture based on their NMR signals.

First, let me recall some NMR basics. Aromatic protons typically show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm, depending on substitution and electronic effects. Singlets mean no neighboring protons, so if the aromatic region has two singlets, each must be a set of equivalent protons that don't have any adjacent Hs.

Wait, but the aromatic signals are in a 1:1 ratio. Since the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes its own signals. So each compound must have a certain number of equivalent aromatic protons, and each contributes a singlet.

Wait, but each compound is contributing signals, so if each compound has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, but perhaps in this case, the mixture averages them? Or maybe each of the two compounds has only one type of aromatic proton, leading to two signals.

Wait, no: the problem says the spectrum shows two signals, each a singlet, so that suggests each compound contributes one set of aromatic protons. Because if each compound had two sets, we would see more signals, but perhaps they are overlapping. Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, and the signals are in 1:1 ratio. So perhaps each compound has only one equivalent set of aromatic protons, which when mixed, give two signals each at 1:1 area.

So each of the two compounds must have a single type of aromatic proton, each as a singlet.

Wait, but benzene rings with substituents usually have multiple sets of protons unless they're highly symmetric.

So which of the given options have only one type of aromatic proton (i.e., all equivalent)? Let's look at the structures.

The options for the compounds are:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
Structure: positions 1,2,4,5 have methyl groups. So the ring has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. The remaining positions are 3 and 6, which are adjacent to each other. Wait, no. Let me visualize benzene with positions 1,2,4,5 occupied. So positions 3 and 6 are empty. Are the hydrogens at 3 and 6 equivalent?

Wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at 1 and 2 (adjacent), and 4 and 5 (adjacent). So the structure would be like two adjacent methyl groups at 1 and 2, then another two adjacent at 4 and 5. So the ring would look like this: 1,2 are meta to 4,5? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a para arrangement?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it or imagine it. Let's number the benzene ring clockwise: position 1 at top, 2 to the right, 3 bottom right, 4 bottom left, 5 left, 6 top left. So substituents at 1,2,4,5. So in this case, positions 3 and 6 are empty. Are the Hs at 3 and 6 equivalent?

Wait, in such a substitution pattern, the ring is symmetric around the axis between 1 and 4. So position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, while position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. Wait, 3 has substituents at 2 and 4; 6 has substituents at 1 and 5. Hmm, but are these environments equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps because of the symmetry, the Hs at 3 and 6 are equivalent. But wait, let's think about the substituents. Each of positions 3 and 6 is adjacent to two methyl groups. Position 3 is next to 2 and 4 (both methyl), and position 6 is next to 1 and 5 (both methyl). So their environments are identical. So the Hs at 3 and 6 are equivalent, so they would be a singlet.

Wait, but also, what about the substituents on the ring? The methyl groups at 1,2,4,5â€”so the ring is symmetric. So the aromatic Hs would be only at 3 and 6, which are equivalent. So the NMR would show a singlet for these two Hs. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet around 6.7 ppm.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are in such a way that the ring is actually a para-substituted structure? Or perhaps a 1,2,4,5 substitution leads to a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the ring has methyl groups in a way that leaves equivalent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring looks like two adjacent pairs. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether the ring has any symmetry. If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, perhaps. So the Hs at 3 and 6 would indeed be equivalent.

So if that's the case, the aromatic Hs would be a singlet. So in the NMR, this compound would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region.

Now, looking at the other options. Let's see:

2. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So methyl groups at 1,2,3,4. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are the Hs at 5 and 6 equivalent?

Wait, 1,2,3,4 would be a ring with four consecutive methyl groups. So the ring would have substituents at positions 1,2,3,4, leaving 5 and 6
