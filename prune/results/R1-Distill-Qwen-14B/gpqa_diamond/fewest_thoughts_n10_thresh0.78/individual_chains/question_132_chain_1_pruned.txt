Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the options given.

Hmm, first, I should recall that the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For each molecule, the formula is CnHm. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m)/2. So n=10, m=14. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So each compound has 4 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3, as it's one ring and three double bonds in the structure) plus one more, which could be a double bond or a ring. Since all the options are tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes, they're all likely to have a benzene ring and some substituents.

Looking at the options, the compounds are:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene

Wait, but the molecular formula for each should be C10H14. Let me check each compound.

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: Benzene (C6H6) with four CH3 groups. Each CH3 brings +1 C and -3 H (since benzene has 6 H, each substitution replaces one H with CH3, so each substitution adds CH3: so each substitution is +1 C and -2 H (since benzene has 6 H, each substitution takes away one H and adds three from CH3: net 2 H added per substitution).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the formula. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is -(CH3), so adding four methyl groups: C6 +4*1 = C10, H6 +4*(3) but wait, each substitution replaces one H, so each methyl adds (3-1)= +2 H. So four methyl groups add 4*2 = 8 H. So total H would be 6 +8=14. So the formula is C10H14. That fits.

Same for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: same reasoning, four methyl groups, so C10H14.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: yes, same formula.

1,4-diethylbenzene: benzene (C6H6) with two ethyl groups (each C2H5). So each ethyl group has 2 carbons. So two ethyl groups would add 4 C, making C6+4= C10. For H: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl substitution replaces one H, so two substitutions replace 2 H. Each ethyl has 5 H (C2H5 has 5 H: because it's CH2CH3, so 2 in CH2 and 3 in CH3). So each ethyl brings in 5 H per substitution. So total H: 6 - 2 (replaced) + 2*(5) = 6-2+10=14. So formula is C10H14. Correct.

Now, the NMR data. The aromatic region has two singlets at 6.7 ppm, 1:1 ratio. Each is a singlet, meaning no neighboring Hs. Wait, in aromatic regions, singlets imply that the Hs are equivalent and not split by adjacent Hs. For example, if the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet.

Wait, but wait, in the aromatic region, the integration is 1:1. So each singlet integrates to the same number. Wait, but wait, the question says, the two signals (two singlets) are in a 1:1 ratio. So each is integrating to the same area. That suggests that each compound in the mixture contributes a single set of equivalent protons, each in 1:1 ratio.
