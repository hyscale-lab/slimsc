Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. After that, the product goes through several treatments, including aqueous sulfuric acid, SO3 with pyridine in DMSO, and finally heating at 150Â°C.

Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: Reaction with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide.

Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source. The starting material is a bicyclic diene, so maybe it's undergoing some Diels-Alder reaction? Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the dienophile part would be the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. But wait, the dienophile usually is something like a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups, right? So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would be the dienophile, and the bicyclo compound is the diene. So the bicyclo has two double bonds, but I'm not sure. Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the structure is a norbornene type structure, with two double bonds: between C2 and C3 (hepta-2,5-diene implies double bonds at 2 and 5? Or is it 2 and 5? Wait, hepta-2,5-diene would have double bonds at 2,3 and 5,6 positions.

Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1], right? So the structure has
