Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1 compared to star_2, that has something to do with their energy levels.

Wait, the question mentions that the energy difference between the specific energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, that's a specific value, but I'm not sure if I need to use it directly. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Since the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I should think about the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of atoms in different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is 2 in star_1. Let me denote that as n1_upper / n1_lower = 2. Similarly, for star_2, the ratio would be n2_upper / n2_lower. The problem states that star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, but wait, I need to clarify: is star_1 twice as excited as star_2's level? Or is star_1's level twice as excited as star_2's in the same energy level? Oh, the question says the energy levels have a fixed energy difference of 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE is the same for both stars.

So, for each star, the ratio of excited to lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, 2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, let's say the ratio is x = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Hmm, so perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the ratio in star_1 is 2 times the ratio in star_2. Let me read that part again.

It says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the same in star_2. Oh, so the relative excitation (the population ratio) is twice as much. So, for star_1, n_upper / n_lower = 2 * (n_upper' / n_lower') for star_2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for star_1, it's 2 times star_2's ratio.

So, let me write that down.

For star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

But from Boltzmann, each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)) for each star.

So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T
