Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, and each produces a different diketone. I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are involved in some kind of diazotization reaction, but wait, that's usually for aromatic amines, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Diazonium salts are typically formed from aromatic amines, but in this case, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Oh, perhaps it's the Stephen reduction or something else. Wait, no, maybe it's the production of carbocation via nitrous acid.

Wait, another thought: when alcohols are treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) or sodium nitrite in acidic conditions, I think it's the production of N-nitrosamines, but that's for secondary amines, not alcohols. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that ketones can undergo some kind of reactions with HCl and sodium nitrite. Oh wait, perhaps the Beckmann rearrangement? No, Beckmann is for oximes, and involves rearrangement to amides. But wait, the products here are diketones, so maybe the starting materials aren't oximes.

Wait, another angle. Diazonium salts are usually from aromatic amines, but if the starting material is an aliphatic amine, like a secondary amine
