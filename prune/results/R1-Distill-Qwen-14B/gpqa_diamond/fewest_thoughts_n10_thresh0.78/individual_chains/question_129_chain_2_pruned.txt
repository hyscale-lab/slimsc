Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, so I'll need to use those to figure it out. Let me list out the steps and the hints.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options given are four different ketones. So, E is likely a ketone, considering the IR peaks. The IR data suggests that A has a carbonyl group (since 1750 is typical for ketones, maybe esters, but probably a ketone given the later steps). E has a carbonyl as well, but maybe a different environment. 

Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN is usually involved in nucleophilic addition. If A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which would have an -OH and -CN group adjacent.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, HCN adds to form a cyanohydrin. But since A is giving a product when reacted with a phosphorous ylide, maybe A is a ketone. Let me think about that.

Wait, the hint a) says that A reacted with a phosphorous ylide gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. 

So, the product of the Wittig reaction from A is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's parse that structure. The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is the ylid part, like CH2-C(-)– something. So the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents at positions 1 and 2 (both methyl), and at position 4, a substituent that is a propenyl group attached as a ylid, perhaps as a double bond.

Wait, no, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has substituents at 1, 2, and 4 positions. Positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps CH2CH2C... Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So in the cyclopentane, position 4 has a substituent which is a propenyl group attached via a double bond. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring, with methyl
