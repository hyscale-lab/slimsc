Okay, I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the size estimate given. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Hmm, let me break this down.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the topology and the contributing factors in the amplitude. Each loop introduces a factor of integration, which often brings in factors of 4π from polar coordinates, and also depends on the coupling constants and energy scales.

Looking at the given expression: the denominator has (4π)^6. Wait, each loop typically contributes a factor of (4π)^something. For example, a one-loop diagram might have a term like (4π)^2 in the denominator because integrating over the loop momentum in 4D spacetime gives a volume factor of (4π)^2 (from the integral in d^4k, which includes a 4π from the angular part and the square from the radius squared). Wait, no, more accurately, in each loop integral, you get something like ∫d^4k/(2π)^4, so perhaps each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^2 factor? Or maybe each loop brings in a (4π)^something else.

Wait, let me think again. The integral over loop momentum in 4D is ∫d^4k/(2π)^4. When you do this, you get terms that involve factors like 4π when you change variables or use dimensional regularization. But more importantly, in the context of loop expansions, each loop usually contributes a factor of (4π)^2 in the numerator because the integral in four dimensions (loop momentum) leads to a term like (4π)^2 when you evaluate the integral, especially in the context of dimensional analysis or when you express the result in terms of loops and renormalization scales.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the general structure of loop integrals. For a one-loop integral in four dimensions, the result often involves terms like (4π)^2 * something. For instance, the integral ∫d^4k/(k^2 + m^2) might lead to expressions with (4π)^2 after computing it, especially in dimensional
