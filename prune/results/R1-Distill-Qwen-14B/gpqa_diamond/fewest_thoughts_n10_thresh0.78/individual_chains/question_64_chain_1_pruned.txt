Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question again.

An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200Â°C without air. Only a mixture of gases formed. Then, without cooling, the gas mixture was passed through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are:

- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gained 3.60g.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) didn't change.
- Tube 3 (Cu) gained 0.80g, and CuO formed.
- Only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temp and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the setup involves heating salts A and B. Since it's an equimolar mixture, moles of A and B are the same. The heating leads to gases being released. The tubes then react with these gases.

Let me think about each tube's role.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, used to absorb water. So, any water vapor in the gas mixture would be absorbed here. The weight gain of 3.60g is likely the mass of water absorbed. So, the gas after this tube would have lost any H2O present.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gases passed through cause a reaction, like CO2 reacting with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the problem states that the weight didn't change. That suggests that the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Which gases don't react with Ca(OH)2? Maybe nitrogen, oxygen, or perhaps an inert gas, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the gas that passed through was N2 or something else that doesn't react. Alternatively, perhaps the gas was CO, which doesn't react with Ca(OH)2 under these conditions. Or maybe it's a noble gas, but that's less likely in a reaction scenario.

Wait, but if the gas didn't react, that could mean that the gas is not acidic, like CO2. Because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2, producing a precipitate. But since the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2. Hmm. So maybe the gas is something else.

But then, what about tube 3? It's red-hot copper. So, any gases passing through that might react. The gas after tube 3 is passed through and then a certain weight is gained. Since Cu is present, perhaps the gas is CO, which would react with copper at high temperatures to form CO2 and Cu. Or maybe it's something else. Wait, let me think: if the gas is CO, when it passes through hot Cu, maybe it doesn't react? Or perhaps if the gas is H2, it would react with CuO but not pure Cu. Hmm.

Wait
