Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data, especially the NOESY spectrum, is key here.

First, I'll try to outline what each part tells me.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since the alkene is cis, when it dehydrates, it would form a cyclic anhydride. So the structure probably has two carboxylic acid groups connected by a cis double bond, which upon dehydration forms a five-membered ring (like maleic anhydride, maybe). 

The anhydride's NMR data is given: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. High upfield for an aromatic, but wait, maybe it's an alkyne or an alkene proton? Alternatively, the 7 ppm region is more typical of alkene protons, but a singlet suggests no neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring, but that would usually have more peaks unless it's something symmetrical. Wait, but the anhydride probably has a conjugated system. Let me think: if the anhydride is something like succinic anhydride, but with a double bond, maybe it's maleic anhydride. Wait, wait, no, maleic is an anhydride of maleic acid which has a cis double bond. The NMR of maleic anhydride shows a pair of protons as a quartet integrating to 4H each? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride in the problem has a single peak, so perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making all the relevant protons equivalent. 

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Carbon types: 137 is probably a carbonyl adjacent carbon (like in an anhydride, the carbons next to the oxygen would be around 130-140 ppm), and 165 is likely a carbonyl carbon, which is higher, like 165-220 ppm. So the anhydride has two carbonyls. But wait, the 13C has two peaks. So all the carbons except for the carbonyls are equivalent? Or perhaps the structure is symmetric, leading to fewer distinct carbons.

Wait, another way: the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR, suggesting all protons in the molecule are equivalent. So if the molecule is highly symmetrical. Maybe it's a
