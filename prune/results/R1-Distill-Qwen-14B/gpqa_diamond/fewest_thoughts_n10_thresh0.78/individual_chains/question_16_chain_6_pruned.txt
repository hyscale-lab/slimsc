Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that optical activity has to do with whether a compound has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. Let me think. So, each of these compounds listed will be evaluated for their chirality, right?

The question is asking how many of them exhibit optical activity. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when there's a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. So, each compound needs to be checked if it has such features.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is an alkene. The configuration is Z. But for optical activity, I think double bonds can sometimes affect it, but wait, do they cause chirality on their own? No, because the double bond is a planar structure. Unless there's a chiral center attached. Let's see the structure. The formula is CH2Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butene is CH2-CH2 groups. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but 1-chloro is on the first carbon. So, the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. The second carbon also has a methyl group. So, the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So, maybe more accurately, it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. Then 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second. So, the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No
