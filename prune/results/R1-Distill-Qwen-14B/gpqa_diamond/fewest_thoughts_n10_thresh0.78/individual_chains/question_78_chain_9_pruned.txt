Okay, so I've got this question about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that potentials are related to the fields, and when charges are moving, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and such. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says that a charge q is moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The vector d is from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

I think the potentials are determined by the retarded time concept. Because the fields (and potentials) depend on where the charge was some time ago, not where it is now. So the charge's position at the retarded time is what matters.

Wait, the scalar potential V and vector potential A are found using the retarded time. Right. The expressions usually involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time.

The scalar potential V is given by (1/(4πε₀)) times q divided by the distance to the charge at the retarded time. But wait, the distance here would be r' which is the position of the charge at tr, which is related to the vector d. Let me see: the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance would be |d|, but how exactly?

Wait, the vector d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to r. So the charge's position at tr is r - d. Wait, no, because d is r - r', where r' is the position of the charge at time tr. Because if the charge is at r' at time tr, then the vector from r' to r is d = r - r'. So the distance from the charge to r is |d|, which is the same as the distance from r' to r. So when we compute potentials, we use that distance.

But in the options, I see terms like (d c - d · v) in the denominators. Oh, wait, that's probably due to the longitudinal component and the effects of motion. Because when the charge is moving, the potentials can have terms
