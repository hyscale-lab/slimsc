Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So that means each of these three groups is positioned every three carbons apart. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. When substituents are meta, they're separated by two carbons. So, for example, if one substituent is at position 1, another meta would be at position 4, and the third would be at position 7, but wait, benzene only has six positions. Oh, right, so they're placed at positions 1, 3, and 5, which are all meta to each other in a six-membered ring. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me get this straight.

No, wait, being meta means each substituent is two positions away. So if one is at position 1, the next meta would be at position 3, and the third would be at position 5. So they're all in the 1,3,5 positions. That's correct because in a six-membered ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other.

But wait, let me make sure. The substituents are carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group, all meta. So they're in positions 1,3,5.

Next, the problem says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, the carboxylic acid is in one position, and two substituents are ortho to it. So let me think: if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then ortho substituents would be at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is one of the meta substituents. So, perhaps the numbering is such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then the other two substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) are at 3 and 5, or maybe 2 and 4? Wait, no, because they must all be meta to each other. So if
