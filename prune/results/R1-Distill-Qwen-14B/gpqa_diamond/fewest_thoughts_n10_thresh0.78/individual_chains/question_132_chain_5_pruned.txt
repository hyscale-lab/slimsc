Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds based on their NMR spectra. Both compounds have the molecular formula C10H14, which means they're derivatives of toluene, I think. Let me start by recalling what the molecular formula implies.

Wait, molecular formula C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees, which probably means one benzene ring (which accounts for 3) and one double bond or a ring and a double bond? Wait, no, four could be a benzene ring (3) plus a double bond (1) or another ring. But in context, since it's an aromatic compound, likely a benzene ring with substituents.

The question says it's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, and the NMR shows two singlets around 6.7ppm, in a 1:1 ratio. Also, three singlets at 2.2ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So, let me think about what these signals could mean. The aromatic protons usually appear around 6.5-8.5 ppm. Singlets in the aromatic region suggest that the protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. So if there's two singlets, each integrating in a 1:1 ratio, that might suggest each compound has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Or perhaps each compound contributes one singlet.

Wait, no. The mixture has two singlets, each as a singlet. So each aromatic region is a singlet. So in each compound, the aromatic protons are in such a way that each has only one set of equivalent H's. For example, compounds where all aromatic protons are equivalent would produce a single peak. But wait, that's not possible unless it's a highly symmetrical structure, like 1,2,3,4,5,
