Alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Okay, the question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene since it's a common alkene. Let me outline the reaction steps one by one.

First, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination of an alkene usually adds bromine across the double bond. So if A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), adding Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B. Wait, but wait—bromine can also do substitution in some cases. Oh, but propene is an alkene, so it's an addition reaction, not substitution. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction. So the two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons. Alcoholic KOH would deprotonate and eliminate HBr. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating HBr from each Br would form propene again? Or wait, no. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, should eliminate two equivalents of HBr. So the structure would lose both Brs, forming propene (CH2=CHCH3) again? Or wait, maybe the elimination is different. Oh wait, no—if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, losing HBr from each end. Wait, but that's actually two HBr molecules. So the product would be 1,2-dibromide eliminating to form propene? Wait, but wait, when you have vicinal dihalide (1,2-dihalide) and treat with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it usually undergoes dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to the formation of an alkene. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then C would be propene again. Oh, wait, but propene is CH2=CHCH3. So C is propene.

Wait, but wait, in the first step, A is propene, which brominates to form 1,2-dibromopropane (B), and then B is dehydrohalogenated to form C. So that makes C propene again? That seems a bit redundant, but maybe that's correct.

Moving on. Compound C is then passed through a red-hot iron tube. That sounds like a dehydrogenation reaction or perhaps a cracking. Wait, red-hot iron is often used in catalytic hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Oh, wait, more accurately, heating with iron might be a way to dehydrogenate alkanes or alkenes. Wait, propene (C) under such conditions—could it be dehydrogenated? But propene is an alkene. Wait, another thought: sometimes, alkenes can be hydrogenated to alkanes using a catalyst, but under different conditions. Alternatively, heating with iron might lead to some isomerization or maybe a diene formation. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Oh! Wait, when alcohols are heated with iron, it's for the oxidation of alcohols, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe C is an alkene, and passing through red-hot iron causes it to form an alkyne. Wait, no, that's more like using a nickel catalyst for hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the propene is being converted into something else.

Wait, wait another angle. If C is propene, and it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a process of dehydrohalogenation or dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction. Wait, but propene is already an alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is a catalyst for some kind of addition or elimination. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe after elimination, compound C isn't propene but something else. Let me re-examine step two. B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it's a dehydrohalogenation, which would eliminate two HBr molecules. So the product would be propene. So C is propene.

So then, moving on. C is propene (CH2=CHCH3). Passing through a red-hot iron tube. Red-hot iron is often used as a catalyst. Wait, propene is an alkene. Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is dehydrogenation. Heating propene with a catalyst can dehydrogenate it to form propyne (an alkyne). Or, alternatively, perhaps it's a process of forming an aromatic compound, but that would require more substitution.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: propene has the structure CH2=CHCH3. When you pass it through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a process of forming something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but that would add hydrogen, turning it into propane. But the description says "red-hot", which is more about a high-temperature process.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but since propene is already an alkene, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound C. Let me re-examine the previous steps.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. So, A is C3H6. Could it be cyclopropane instead of propene? Hmm, cyclopropane is a three-membered ring. Bromination of cyclopropane would probably open it up. But cyclopropane is less likely because propene is more common in such reactions. Let me proceed under the assumption that A is propene.

So, back to the problem. C is propene. When it's passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a process to form something else. Let me think of another reaction. Oh! Wait, maybe it's a process to dehydrohalogenate again, but I don't think so because we already did that. Alternatively, perhaps the iron is used in a reaction to make an alkyne. So, propene could be dehydrohalogenated twice to form 1-propyne. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, another approach: maybe the iron is used as a catalyst for some kind of elimination. Wait, perhaps propene is being converted into something else. Let me think: propene + heat with Fe might not change it much. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps the correct product is another compound. Let me think about what else could happen.

Wait another thought: propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, which is a setup for the formation of an alkyne. So, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation again, but wait, propene doesn't have halogens. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Wait, perhaps I messed up the earlier steps.

Wait, let me think again. Step 1: A (C3H6) is propene; bromination in CCl4 adds Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Step 2: B reacts with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming propene (C). Step 3: C (propene) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Hmm, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation. Dehydrogenation of propene to form propyne (the alkyne). So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) becomes HC≡C-CH3. So that would be compound D.

Wait, but wait, when you dehydrogenate propene, you'd remove H's to form an alkyne. So, for each alkyne bond, you lose two H's. So, propene (CH2=CH2) would become HC≡CH, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, dehydrogenation would take CH2=CHCH3 and form HC≡C-CH3 (propyne). So D is propyne.

Now, step 4: D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm, propyne is HC≡C-CH3. Reacting with two strong acids—maybe H2SO4 and H2SO3? Or perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3? Or I'm thinking of a hydration reaction. Hydration of an alkyne with strong acids can form ketones. Let's see. Propyne (HC≡C-CH3) would, upon hydration, form propan-2-one (acetone). So E would be acetone (propan-2-one).

Step 5: E (acetone) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form F. Iron and HCl... Hmm, that's a classic setup for a pinacol rearrangement? Wait, no, pinacol rearrangement is when a diol is treated with acid and heat. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoin condensation, but that's with cyanide. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that typically uses CO and HCl with a catalyst. Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, acetone (propan-2-one) with iron and HCl. Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of benzene from a ketone via some reduction, but acetone is a three-carbon ketone. Another possibility is the Birch reduction, but that uses ammonia and a metal like Na or Mg. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, acetone (propan-2-one) would be reduced to propane (CH3CH2CH3) via Clemmensen. So F would be propane.

Wait, but wait, Clemmensen requires an acid, like HCl, and a metal like zinc in the amalgam. So yes, if E is acetone, F would be propane. So F is propane.

Next, step 6: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid (HNO2) typically reacts with alkanes under certain conditions, but wait, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, nitrous acid is used for diazotization, but that's with aromatic amines. For alkanes, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe F is not propane but something else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's retrace. E is acetone. Reacting with Fe and HCl, what's that? Oh, wait! Maybe it's the formation of benzene via the Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of toluene from a ketone via some process. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach. Acetone (E) with iron and HCl could be undergoing a condensation reaction. Or perhaps it's forming something else. Wait, maybe it's the formation of isopropyl chloride via some mechanism. Or perhaps a different reaction altogether. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction. Wait, perhaps acetone is being reduced to isopropyl alcohol, but that would require a different catalyst. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's go back. If D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3), then E is formed by reacting with two strong acids. Another possibility is that D is propyne reacting with H2O under acid catalysis to form acetone. So E is acetone.

Then E (acetone) reacts with iron and HCl. Wait, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but Grignard reagents are formed from alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of an organometallic compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is being used in a Birch reduction. Wait, Birch reduction uses Li or Na in NH3, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps E is acetone, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it undergoes some alkylation. But I'm not recalling the exact reaction. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that requires an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps E is undergoing a Cannizzaro reaction, which is when a ketone without alpha hydrogens is treated with a strong base, but E has alpha hydrogens (acetone has two CH3 groups attached to the carbonyl). Hmm, so Cannizzaro isn't applicable.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps it's a reaction to form an alkyne again. But I'm not making progress here. Let me think differently. Maybe E is acetone, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it's being reduced. Wait, Fe and HCl is acidic. But I'm not sure about the product. Alternatively, perhaps it's being converted into something else. Maybe I'm wrong about E.

Wait, maybe D is not propyne. Let's reevaluate step 3. If C is propene, and passing through a red-hot iron tube leads to an elimination, but propene is already an alkene. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3.

Wait, maybe I should think that C is 1,2-dibromopropane, and when treated with alcoholic KOH, it eliminates to form 1-bromopropane? No, wait, no, elimination is more likely. Oh wait, when you have a dihalide, elimination of two HX's would form a double bond. So, for 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr's would form propene. So C is propene.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed, even if I'm a bit stuck on step 5. Alternatively, perhaps E is another compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps D is something else. Let me think again. If C is propene, and when passed through a red-hot iron tube, maybe it's a process to form something else. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, but that would require H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cracking process, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is propene, and passing through a red-hot iron tube is a way to form benzene via some dehydrogenation. Wait, but that seems unlikely because propene is only three carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a process to form a diene, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed and see if I can figure out the options.

So, assuming that F is propane, but then F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, but with alkanes, perhaps it doesn't do much. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, another angle: perhaps when C (propene) is passed through red-hot iron, it forms something else. Maybe it's a process to form acetone via oxidation. So, propene (C) is oxidized to acetone (CH3COCH3), making E acetone. Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl to form something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction sequence is such that after E is formed, F is formed via a different route. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in step 3. Let me think again about step 3. If C is propene, and when passed through red-hot iron, maybe it's a process to form something else. Wait, another possibility: propene could undergo dehydrohalogenation again, but that doesn't make sense as it already is an alkene.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me move to the options and see if I can work backward.

The options are about the products. Let's look at the options:

Option A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.
Option B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.
Option C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.
Option D) C is a flammable gas.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is propene, which is a gas at room temperature. Yes, propene is a flammable gas. So option D says that, so it's a correct statement, meaning the incorrect statement is not D.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3), its NMR would have protons on the terminal CH3. The structure is HC≡C-CH3. The CH3 group is a singlet because all three H's are equivalent and there's no neighboring H's. So one singlet. Wait, but wait, the alkyne is between two CH3 groups? No, propyne is CH3-C≡CH, right? Wait, no. Propyne is HC≡C-CH3. So the CH3 is attached to the carbon adjacent to the triple bond. So the CH3 group is a singlet, and the H on the other end (the HC≡C-) is a singlet as well. Wait, wait, no. The structure is HC≡C-CH3. The H on the triple bond (the sp-hybridized C) is a singlet because it's attached to a triple bond and has no neighboring H. The CH3 group is also a singlet because they're attached to the same C and have no neighboring H. So that would give two singlets in the NMR. So option C says that, which would be correct. So if D is propyne, option C is correct. So the incorrect statement is not option C.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is used in the benzidine test for phenols. Wait, no, actually, phenols give a yellow precipitate with FeCl3 because phenol can form a complex with Fe^3+ ions. Alternatively, if H is a phenol, then it would give a yellow color. So if H is a phenol, option B is correct. But I'm not sure about what H is yet.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, which is an alkane, I don't think it's used for dye synthesis. Dyes are more likely to come from aromatic compounds or conjugated systems. So if F is propane, option A would be incorrect. But if F is something else, like benzene, then option A would be correct because benzene is a raw material for many dyes.

Wait, but earlier I thought F was propane, but that led to a problem because F reacting with nitrous acid wouldn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to retrace the steps. Let me try to outline each step again:

1. A (C3H6) → bromination in CCl4 → B (1,2-dibromopropane)
2. B → alcoholic KOH → C (propene via elimination)
3. C → red-hot Fe → D (propyne)
4. D → two strong acids → E (acetone)
5. E → Fe scrap, HCl → F (propane?)
6. F → nitrous acid → G (what? If F is propane, then maybe it's not reacting. Alternatively, maybe F is benzene, but I'm way off track.)

Wait, perhaps step 5 is incorrect. Let me think again. E is acetone. When treated with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's undergoing a reduction. Acetone (propan-2-one) upon reduction would form propane via Clemmensen. So F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But I'm not sure what that would be. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about step 5.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is acetone, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it's undergoing a different reaction. Maybe it's the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that requires an alkyl halide. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps step 5 is a pinacol rearrangement. Wait, pinacol rearrangement needs a 1,2-diol. So maybe E is diol. But I don't see that happening.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps E is acetone, and when treated with Fe and HCl, it's forming something else, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But acetone isn't an alkyl halide, so that might not work.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think of each step again.

Step 6: F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. If F is propane, nitrous acid might not react. Alternatively, maybe F is something else, like a primary amine, which would react with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. But I don't see how F would be an amine.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's try to figure out what each compound is.

A: C3H6 → propene

B: 1,2-dibromopropane

C: propene (after elimination)

D: propyne (after dehydrogenation)

E: acetone (from hydration of propyne)

F: propane (from reduction of acetone)

Wait, but then F is propane. So step 6: G is formed when F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the reduction step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps step 5 is a Benzoin condensation, but that requires cyanide. Alternatively, maybe E is being used in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in step 5 is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but without an alkyl halide, I don't think that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps E (acetone) is undergoing a reaction to form something else, like isopropyl alcohol, but that would require a different catalyst.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think again. Maybe when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it forms something else. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation again, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps in step 3, the propene is being deprotonated and forms a metal acetylide. But that would require a different setup, like with sodium in ammonia.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe in step 3, propene is oxidized to form something else. Wait, propene can be oxidized to form ketones or other compounds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that D is benzene. Wait, how? Let me think: if C is propene and D is benzene, that would require a triple bond and some cyclization. But I don't see that happening.

Wait, perhaps step 3 is a dehydrogenation of propene to form propyne (HC≡C-CH3), which is D.

Then, step 4: D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids. Wait, maybe it's a hydration reaction. Propyne + H2O in acidic conditions forms acetone (CH3COCH3), so E is acetone.

Step 5: E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Maybe this is a reduction step, turning acetone into propane via Clemmensen. So F is propane.

Step 6: F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe nothing? Or perhaps I'm wrong about F.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in step 5, E (acetone) is being converted into another compound. Maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that would form a ketone oxide, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps step 5 is a benzilic acid rearrangement, but that requires a diketone.

Hmm. I'm stuck on step 5. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the sequence is such that G is a primary amine, and then when reacted with NaOH, it forms H. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form a phenol or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the options and see which ones are correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct. So the incorrect is not D.

Option C: D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR. If D is propyne (HC≡C-CH3), then the structure is CH3-C≡CH. The CH3 group would be a triplet? No, wait, wait. The CH3 is attached to the carbon adjacent to the triple bond. The CH3 group is a singlet because all three H's are equivalent and there are no neighboring protons. The H on the other end (sp-hybridized) is a singlet as well because it's attached to a carbon with no adjacent H. So in the NMR, there would be two singlets: one at around δ 1.5 ppm (CH3) and another around δ 2.5 ppm (sp H). So option C is correct, as D gives two singlets. So the incorrect is not C.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product when G reacts with NaOH. Let's think about G. G is formed when F reacts with nitrous acid. If F is propane, then G would be perhaps a nitro compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps F is something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think that F is benzene. Then, F (benzene) reacting with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with NaOH would form a phenol. But that doesn't fit with the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off track. Let me think about each step again.

1. A: propene → bromination → B: 1,2-dibromopropane.
2. B → alcoholic KOH → C: propene via elimination.
3. C → red-hot Fe → D: propyne.
4. D → two strong acids → E: acetone.
5. E → Fe and HCl → F: propane.
6. F → nitrous acid → G: ?
7. G → NaOH → H: ?

If F is propane, reacting with nitrous acid might not do much. Wait, but perhaps F is something else. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3: when propene is passed through red-hot Fe, it's a process to form something else, like cyclopropane? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form benzene, but that's not possible from propene.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think: if C is propene, and reaction with red-hot Fe leads to dehydrogenation to form propyne. So D is propyne. Then, D reacts with two strong acids (maybe H2SO4 and H2O) to form acetone (E). E is acetone. Then, E is treated with Fe and HCl. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: acetone (E) could undergo a Benzoin condensation, but that requires a cyanide catalyst, which isn't present here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Cannizzaro reaction, but that requires a strong base and a ketone without alpha hydrogens. Acetone has alpha hydrogens, so Cannizzaro isn't applicable.

Wait, perhaps E (acetone) is being used in a Grignard reaction, but without an alkyl halide, it doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps E is undergoing a reduction. Acetone could be reduced to propane via Clemmensen (Zn-Hg, HCl, heat). So F is propane.

Then F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with amines to form diazonium salts, but with alkanes, I'm not sure. Maybe nothing happens, but that would make G equal to F, which seems unlikely.

Hmm. I'm stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in step 3. Let's think again.

If in step 3, C (propene) is passed through red-hot Fe, perhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation, turning the alkene into an alkane. So D would be propane.

Then, step 4: D (propane) reacts with two strong acids to form E. Hmm, two strong acids. Maybe H2SO4 and HNO3. But what reaction would that be? Propane is an alkane, not very reactive. Maybe nothing happens, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and H2O, leading to an acid-catalyzed hydration, but propane doesn't have a double bond to hydrate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about step 3. Let me think: if C is propene, and step 3 produces D as propane via hydrogenation, then step 4 would have D (propane) reacting with two strong acids to form E. But I don't see a reaction for that.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a different reaction. Maybe C is propene, and upon passing through red-hot Fe, it forms something else, like vinyl chloride. No, that would require addition of HCl, which isn't part of the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a process to form an aromatic compound. But that seems too big a leap from propene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, it's unlikely. But if F is benzene, then option A is correct because benzene is used in dye synthesis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think: is there a way for F to be benzene?

Another approach:

1. A is propene (C3H6).
2. B is 1,2-dibromopropane.
3. C is propene.
4. C (propene) passed through red-hot Fe → D is benzene? That would require a lot of dehydrogenation and ring formation, which isn't feasible with just propene. So that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility is that after E is formed, which is acetone, F is formed via a different reaction. Maybe E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl to form something like benzaldehyde, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E (acetone) is undergoing a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that requires another ketone or aldehyde.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what each product could be.

Let me think of each compound:

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: propene.

D: propyne.

E: acetone.

F: propane.

G: ?

H: ?

So when G reacts with NaOH, it forms H. Let's think about G. If F is propane, and G is formed by reacting with nitrous acid, perhaps G is a primary amine, but that doesn't make sense because F is propane.

Wait, another thought: perhaps F is propane, and when treated with nitrous acid (HNO2), it doesn't react, so G is the same as F. Then, when G (propane) reacts with NaOH, perhaps nothing happens, making H = propane. But that doesn't fit any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about F. Let me think: perhaps when E (acetone) is treated with Fe and HCl, it forms something else. Maybe it's a reduction, but I don't see it.

Another possibility: E is acetone, and F is isopropyl chloride. But how? Without an alkyl halide, I don't see that happening.

Wait, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me try to go through each option and see which is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct. The incorrect statement is not D.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). So the CH3 is a singlet, and the H on the triple bond is a singlet. So yes, two singlets. So option C is correct.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H is the product of G reacting with NaOH. If G is a phenol, then H would be the same as G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if G is a diazonium salt, reacting with NaOH would give a phenol, which would give a yellow precipitate with FeCl3. So if H is a phenol, option B is correct.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, then option A is incorrect. But if F is benzene, it's correct. So the incorrect statement would be option A.

Wait, but according to my earlier steps, F is propane, making option A incorrect. So the incorrect statement is option A.

But wait, is there any way that F is not propane? Let me think.

In step 5, if E is acetone, and F is something else. Maybe E is being used in a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps step 5 is a Birch reduction, which would reduce acetone to something else, but Birch requires ammonia and metal, which doesn't fit the conditions (Fe and HCl).

Alternatively, perhaps E is being used in a Grignard reaction, but that would require an alkyl halide.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck on the earlier steps, but based on the options, the incorrect statement is either A or something else.

Wait, another thought: if F is propane, then F is an alkane. Alkanes aren't used in dye synthesis, so option A would be incorrect. Thus, the incorrect statement is option A.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C3H6), which is identified as propene. Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride adds bromine across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes two eliminations of HBr, regenerating propene (Compound C). Propene (C) is a flammable gas, making Option D correct.

When propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (Compound D). Propyne has the structure HC≡C-CH3, and its 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets: one from the CH3 group and one from the sp-hybridized H on the triple bond. This confirms that Option C is correct.

Propyne (D) reacts with two strong acids (likely H2SO4 and H2O) to undergo hydration, forming acetone (Compound E). Acetone (E) is then treated with Fe and HCl, which reduces it via the Clemmensen reduction to form propane (Compound F). Propane is an alkane and not typically used in the synthesis of dyes, making Option A incorrect.

Finally, propane (F) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), which does not produce a meaningful reaction under these conditions. When the product (G) reacts with NaOH, it forms Compound H. If H is a phenol, it would give a yellow precipitate with ferric chloride solution, confirming Option B as correct.

The incorrect statement is Option A, as propane is not used for the synthesis of dyes.

Answer: A
