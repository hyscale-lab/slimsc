Okay, I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease in white lupine. Let me read through the problem again and see if I can figure it out.

So, the setup is that we have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. When they tested the mutants for resistance to anthracnose, they got these results:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance (so more susceptible)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. And the question is about the interactions between these genes.

Hmm, the options are A, B, C, D. Each has something about which is the transcription factor, whether others show pleiotropy, redundancy, etc., and which is epistatic to whom.

Wait, I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. Epistatic genes are those whose products are downstream, I think. So, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. Like, if g2g3 is 0%, same as g2, then G2 might be epistatic over G3. Or maybe the other way around.

Let me list all the data again:

Single mutants:
g1: 75% (so some resistance)
g2: 0% (no resistance)
g3: 50%

Double mutants:
g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
g1g3: 10% (worse than either single)
g2g3: 0% (same as g2 and g3?)

Wait, but the double mutant g2g3 has 0% resistance. The single g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%. So when both g2 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance is 0%â€”same as g2. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to g3. Because if you have both mutations, the phenotype is the same as when only g2 is mutated. So, the pathway might be that G2 is upstream of G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate G3.

Wait, but let's think. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of downstream genes
