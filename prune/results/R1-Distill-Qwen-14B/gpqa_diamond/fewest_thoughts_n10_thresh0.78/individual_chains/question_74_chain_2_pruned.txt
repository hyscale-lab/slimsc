Okay, so I've got this physics problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with the topic. But let's try to think it through.

The question is about the probability of an atom decaying. So, the setup is that we have an atom that has a certain decay probability. We know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. But in this case, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're supposed to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes after the initial 100, making it 250 total, or the next 150 after the 50 that have already passed, making it 200 total? No, wait, no, the initial time given is 100 minutes, but 50 have passed. So the remaining time would be 100-50=50 minutes? Or wait, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes after the current time. So, if 50 minutes have passed, and we're now looking at the next 150, that's a total of 200 minutes from the start. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the half-life or the decay constant is determined based on that. But then, 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So now we're looking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So that would be the probability from time t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes from now.

But wait, another approach: In radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless. That is, the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So whether the atom was just created or has been around for a while, the probability of decay in the next interval depends only on the time remaining.

So, the decay probability given is 32% over 100 minutes. Let's model this. The decay probability is often modeled with an exponential function. The formula for the probability of decay is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

First, find λ. Because over 100 minutes, the probability is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Solving for λ:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ)
e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Take natural log on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = -ln(0.68)/(100)

Let me compute ln(0.68). Well, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, so ln(0.68) should be a bit lower, maybe around -0.385. Wait, I'm not good at exact numbers, but let's just keep it as ln(0.68) for now.

So λ ≈ 0.3856 / 100 ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, we need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability is P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no: the 100 minutes was a specific time period, but now we're looking for 150 minutes. That's the time starting from the current time, which is after 50 minutes. So the
