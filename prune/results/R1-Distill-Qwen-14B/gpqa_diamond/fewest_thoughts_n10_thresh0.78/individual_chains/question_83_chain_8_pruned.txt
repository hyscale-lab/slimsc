Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The setup is that we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Hmm. I remember that when you titrate an acid with a base, the pH changes based on how much of the base has been added. At 25% titration, that means we've added a quarter of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Let me think about how to approach each part.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution factor.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2.

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Wait, 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, that's correct because when you add equal volumes, the concentration halves. 0.05 / 2 is 0.025. Right.

Next, during titration, the NaOH will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present initially. Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.

The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (20 +20). So moles = M * V (in liters). M is 0.025 M, V is 0.04 L.

Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. The volume needed to reach equivalence can be found by moles NaOH = moles acetic acid.

Moles NaOH = 0.001 = 0.1 M * V → V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks for two points: 25% titration and equivalence.

25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, let's tackle each part.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So, moles of NaOH added = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00
