Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Let me start by looking at each piece of information provided.

First, the mass spectrometry data: there's a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. The other peak at 158 is 32%, which is a common fragment. I'll have to think about what those could be.

Next, the IR data. It shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretch. A broad peak could mean either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl stretch. What carbonyls absorb around there? Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. Alternatively, esters or amides also have peaks in that area. Wait, but the peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's an ester or an acid chloride? Or perhaps an aldehyde? Let me think. Aldehydes have lower wavenumbers, maybe around 1720-1710. Carboxylic acids typically are around 1700 but can vary. Or maybe it's an acid chloride, which has a higher carbonyl stretch, around 1800 or so. So 1720 is a bit lower than that.

The 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). 11 ppm is really high. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and phenol protons are around 7-8.5, but 11 is way higher. So a carboxylic acid seems likely. The broad peak in IR would fit with that, but wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches, which are usually around 3000-2500, but the IR says a broad peak from 3500-2700, which might include that. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H would also be a broad peak but maybe a bit lower in wavenumber? I'm a bit confused there.

Looking at the NMR: the singlet at 11 ppm is probably the -COOH proton. Then, the other peaks are the aromatic protons. 8.02 and 7.72 ppm are both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into a doublet each. So for example, if we have a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each substituent would give a doublet. Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl, OH, and CHO substituents on the benzene. But this would be a meta arrangement. Wait, no. Let me sketch it: positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 5 (CHO?) Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-hydroxy, 3-chloro, and the aldehyde in position 1? No, wait, benzaldehyde is position 1. So 3-ch
