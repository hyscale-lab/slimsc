Okay, let me try to figure out this organic chemistry problem step by step. So the question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a final product. There are five steps, each leading to a new product. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each reaction.

First, the initial reaction: benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that HNO3 with H2SO4 is a nitrating mixture. Benzene undergoes nitration, which is an electrophilic substitution where a nitro group is added. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. Wait, no, wait: when benzene undergoes nitration, the major product is nitrobenzene, yes. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 (nitrobenzene) is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Iron and bromine usually do a bromination via a substitution reaction. But wait, nitrobenzene is a meta director. So when you brominate nitrobenzene, the bromine adds in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So product 2 would be meta-bromonitrobenzene. Wait, but the structure would be 3-bromo nitrobenzene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Nitro group is at position 1. Hydrogen gets replaced by bromine at position 3 (
