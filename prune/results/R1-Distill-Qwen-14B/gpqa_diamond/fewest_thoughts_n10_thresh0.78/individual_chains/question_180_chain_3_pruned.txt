Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, which probably means we can ignore their kinetic energy or any relativistic effects. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about electric potential energy. Because when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. And since we're looking for the minimum energy, maybe it's the potential energy of the system in its most stable configuration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the particles are identical and all have the same charge. Since like charges repel, the potential energy should be positive, right? Because each pair of charges contributes positively to the total potential energy. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from the 13th charge, which is fixed.

So, the system consists of the 13th charge at the center and 12 charges arranged around it, each at 2 meters away. But wait, are the 12 charges all fixed at 2 meters from P? The problem says 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so maybe they're all at the same point? Or are they distributed in some way around point P? Hmm, I think the problem is considering each of the 12 charges to be at a distance of 2 m from P, but maybe they're all fixed at that position, perhaps in a spherical arrangement or something. But for potential energy calculations, maybe the exact arrangement isn't needed because all pairs contribute.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, the total potential energy U is the sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j)/r_ij.

In this case, all the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from the 13th. So, the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at r = 2 m from P.

So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge. So the potential energy from the 13th charge and each of the 12 is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) for each pair.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so we have 12 charges each interacting with the 13th. Each of these interactions contributes to the potential
