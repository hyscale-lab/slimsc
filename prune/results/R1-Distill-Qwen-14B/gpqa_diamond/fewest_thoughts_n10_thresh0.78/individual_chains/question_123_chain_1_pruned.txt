Okay, so I need to figure out the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with special relativity because we're dealing with different reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant speed.

Wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. So, I should probably consider the velocity between these frames and use the time dilation effect from relativity.

The ejecta sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That's like 6e4 km/s. Wait, but that's a huge fraction of the speed of light. Let me think about the speed of light, which is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light, right? So 0.2c.

Wait, no, wait: 60,000 km/s divided by 3e5 km/s is 0.2. So v = 0.2c.

But the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, how much time passes when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds?

Right, because time dilation occurs. The proper time (the time in the moving frame) is shorter than the time in the stationary frame. Or wait, waitâ€”what's the proper time here? In special relativity, the proper
