Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics and the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's think it through. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait. I'm not super familiar with this notation, but I think the Lagrangian describes how the boson X interacts with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion pairs X can decay into.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle. So, it's like X → f f̄; so 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, first, I need to know the masses of all the possible fermions involved here.

The Standard Model fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau). Also, for each quark, there's an antiquark, and for leptons, their corresponding antiparticles.

Let me list the approximate masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV? Wait, no, that's too light. Wait, no, I might be mixing up. Wait, actually, the up quark mass is around 2 MeV, down is about 4-5 MeV, strange is around 95-100 MeV. Charm is around 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV, top is about 173 GeV. 

For leptons: electron is 0.511 MeV, muon is about 105.7 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV.

So, X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, let's compute 2m_f for each possible fermion.

Looking at each option's possible decay products:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is larger than X's 6 GeV. That means X can't decay into b b̄, because 6 < 9, so it's not kinematically allowed. So option A can't be correct.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, c is charm, mass around 1.5
