Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8 × 10^-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The setup includes the energy in the bubble chamber being 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are four different distances, varying by orders of magnitude.

Alright, first, I need to think about what this minimum resolution refers to. I remember that in particle physics, the resolution of a detector relates to how well it can measure the position where a particle decays. The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime appears longer due to time dilation, right? So the observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but the problem is about observing the decay. I think the key here is that the particle has to travel a certain distance before decaying. The minimum resolution would relate to the minimum length the particle can travel for us to detect the decay products. Oh, right! The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, but when it's moving at high speed, its lifetime from our frame (lab frame) is longer.

So the first step is to find the speed of the particle X⁰. Since we know its energy and mass, we can find the gamma factor γ. Gamma is given by E / (m c²), right? Wait, but in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics, E = γ m. So here, the mass m is 3.41 GeV/c², and the energy E is 27 GeV. So gamma would be E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 7.918. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 3.41*7.9=27 (because 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.9=3.069, total 26.939). Oh wait, 3.41 *8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.918. So gamma is about 7.918.

Once I have gamma, the lifetime in the lab frame τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀. Then, the distance the particle travels before decaying is its speed multiplied by this dilated lifetime. The speed v of the particle can be found from the beta factor. Since gamma is 7.918, beta (v/c) is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, let me think again. The relation between gamma and beta is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me plug in gamma=7.918. 1/gamma² is about 1/(62.7) ≈ 0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 is 0.98404. Taking square root: sqrt(0.98404) is approximately 0.992. So beta is about 0.992, which makes sense because high gamma implies the particle is moving very close to the speed of light.

So now, the velocity v is approximately 0.992c. But let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 7.91
