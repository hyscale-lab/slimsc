Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula derived from the Miller indices (hkl). The general formula is d = a / sqrt((h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α))), but wait, wait... or is that something else? Oh right, that's when the unit cell is a rhombohedral (trigonal) system, right?

Wait, no, maybe I should recall the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where all edges are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal (α = β = γ). So the formula for interplanar distance is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

In this problem, the given angles are all 30 degrees, so α = β = γ = 30°. The Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

Wait, but wait, I think the formula might have a different sign convention. Let me double-check. Oh right, wait, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ). Or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice. 

The formula for interplanar distance in a cubic system is straightforward, but rhombohedral is more complex. Oh right, yes, in the general case for a crystal system, the interplanar distance formula is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²)) + (k²/(b²)) + (l²/(c²)) - 2hk cos γ/(ab) - 2hl cos β/(ac) - 2kl cos α/(bc
