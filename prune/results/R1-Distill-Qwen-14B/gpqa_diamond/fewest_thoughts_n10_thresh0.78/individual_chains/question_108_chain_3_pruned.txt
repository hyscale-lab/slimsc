Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question states that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE. The transition has a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series or something like that in hydrogen.

Wait, I remember that the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether m here is orbital or spin. Oh, the question says orbital, so m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which ranges from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

The paramagnetic coupling term H' would then be the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So H' = -μ·B. Since the field is along Oz, this simplifies to H' = -μ_z B. Substituting μ_z = -g μ_B m, we get H' = g μ_B m B. Wait, no, actually I think the energy term is -μ·B. So let me get that right. The energy is E = -μ·B. So for a magnetic moment aligned with B, the energy is lower. So E = -μ_z B. But μ_z is g μ_B m. So E = -g μ_B m B. But wait, actually, the paramagnetic term is usually written as H' = -μ·B = -g μ_B m B (since B is along z). Or wait, maybe it's H' = μ·B. I need to check the formula. Oh, I
