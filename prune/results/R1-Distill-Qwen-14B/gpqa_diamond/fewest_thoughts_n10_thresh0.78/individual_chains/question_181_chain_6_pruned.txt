Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I need to figure out the flux ratio between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Let me think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chains. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the question specifically stops the pp-III branch. So all other reactions continue as usual.

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of these reactions. The main ones are the electron neutrinos (Î½e) from the fusion processes. One of the key neutrinos is the Beryllium-7 neutrino, which I think comes from the pp-III branch. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions where Be-7 captures a proton to form two protons and helium-4, releasing a neutrino.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means the production of that specific neutrino (maybe the 700-800 keV band?) would suddenly drop. Wait, what's the energy of the neutrinos from each process? I remember that the standard solar neutrinos from the dominant pp-I branch (like the proton-proton chain) produce neutrinos around lower energies, maybe up to a few hundred keV. The higher energy neutrinos come from other processes, like the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle or the pp-III branch.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Let me think about the neutrino energies. The pp-I chain produces neutrinos with energies around 200-300 keV. The pp-III might produce higher, like 700-800 or more? Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. Hmm.

Wait, I recall that the dominant neutrino flux in the Sun comes from the proton-proton chain, which mainly produces neutrinos with energies around 500 keV or so. But wait, maybe the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. Or wait, maybe the Be-7 neutrinos have a higher energy. Let me recall: the main pp chain (pp-I) produces a neutrino when a boron-8 decays into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is about 15-20 keV, I think. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the Beryllium neutrinos with others.

Wait, another possibility: the primary neutrinos are from the decay of Beryllium-7, which occurs in the pp-III branch. The Beryllium-7 (Be7) captures a proton to become Boron-8 (B8), which then decays into two He-4 nuclei. The decay of Be7 produces a neutrino with an energy of about 700-800 keV. Oh wait, I think the Be7 neutrino is around 478 keV. Let me get this right. No, wait, the neutrino from the decay of Be7 is about 478 keV. Hmm, but that's in the 0.4-0.5 MeV range. Then the pp-III branch captures a proton, which emits a neutrino. So perhaps the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy, maybe in the 800 keV range or higher.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutrino energy bands. The question has two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So if the pp-III branch stops, which neutrinos are affected?

If the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in band 2 (8
