Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So if it's 20%, then 20% of the star's surface is spots. But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

The star's effective temperature, Teff, is 6000K. The spots are cooler, I assume, because they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000K. So the spots are either 5000K or 7000K? Wait, no, the spots are cooler because dark spots are usually cooler regions. So the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K. Because 6000-1000=5000.

Now, the scenario is that when this star is observed, because it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is covered, as it rotates, the brightness changes because the spots move in and out of the observed hemisphere. But the question says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. Because when a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. So the star's spots causing a similar dip as a planet would.

The question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star? So we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

So I think the approach is to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and compare it to the change caused by an exoplanet transit.

First, let's think about the star's brightness without any spots.
