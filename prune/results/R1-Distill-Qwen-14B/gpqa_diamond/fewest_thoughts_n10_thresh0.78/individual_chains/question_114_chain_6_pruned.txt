Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

The first reaction is: butan-2-one (which I think is methylacetone, (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile group, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. 

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with HCN usually gives cyanohydrins. The cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with HCN to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. But here, the reagent is NaCN, which is sodium cyanide. So perhaps the reaction is under acidic conditions because adding HCN is acidic.

Wait, but if you have NaCN and acid, maybe it's acting as a source of HCN when protonated. Because NaCN is a salt, but in acidic conditions, HCN would be formed. So in reaction 1, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN in acidic conditions (like H3O+). The mechanism would be the ketone attacking HCN, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid), which is option A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (that's a mouthful) reacts with reagent B and water to form the corresponding acid. So the nitr
