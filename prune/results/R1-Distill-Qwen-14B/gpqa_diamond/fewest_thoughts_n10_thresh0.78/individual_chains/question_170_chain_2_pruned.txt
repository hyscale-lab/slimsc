Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spin states and expectation values, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation probably means the spinor is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So the state ψ is [3i; 4]. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component spinors.

The question is asking for the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Oh wait, but S_y itself is an operator. The Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. Remember, the spin operator S is given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y.

Let me write down σ_y. From the note, σ_y is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the state ψ is [3i; 4]. Let me denote ψ as a column vector: ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

To compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ
