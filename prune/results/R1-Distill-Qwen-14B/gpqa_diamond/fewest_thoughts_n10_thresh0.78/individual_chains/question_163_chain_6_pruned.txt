Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these stoichiometry and solution chemistry questions. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so that might help if I get stuck.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would help me convert grams to moles. Fe has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- is 17 g/mol, so three of them would be 51. So the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Right?

So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol will give me the moles. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. So about 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Next, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. When it's dissolved in a strong acid, like HCl or HNO3, it should react. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will need 3 moles of H+ ions.

So for 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, I need 0.000936 * 3 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

The acid provided is monobasic and strong, so it should fully dissociate. Let's say it's HX, which contributes one H+ per molecule. The concentration is 0.1 M, so the moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.1 M * volume in liters.

Wait, but the volume I'm looking for is in cm³, which is the same as milliliters. So if I let V be the volume in cm³, then the moles of H+ is 0.1 * (V/1000) = 0.0001 * V.

So I need 0.0001 * V ≥ 0.002808. Solving for V: V ≥ 0.002808 / 0.0001 = 28.08 cm³. So the minimum volume is about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, let's see: option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. But wait, let me think—did I make any miscalculations?

Wait, 0.1 g divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Then 3 times that is 0.002808. The acid is 0.1 M, so the required volume is 28.08 cm³. So the closest option for the volume is C)28.05. But wait, perhaps I should double-check my molar mass.

Wait, Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(17.00) = 55.845 + 51.00 = 106.845 g/mol. So 0.1 g / 106.845 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 mol. Then 0.0009359 *3 = 0.0028077 mol H+ needed. The required H+ is 0.0028077.

The acid is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V (in liters). So V = moles / M = 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 liters, which is 28.077 cm³, approximately 28.08 cm³. So option C says 28.05, which is very close. Maybe it's due to rounding. So the volume is about 28.08 cm³. So option C is the closest for the volume.

Now, what about the pH of the resulting solution? Hmm. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ ions. The pH depends on the concentration of H+ in the solution.

Wait, but how much H+ is present? Initially, I added 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl (for example) to 100 cm³ of solution. Wait, wait, the total volume is 100 cm³? Or is the volume after adding the acid 100 cm³?

Wait, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So when I add V cm³ of acid to the solution, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Hmm, but wait, that might not be correct.
