Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. Let me think about the concepts involved here.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, no, wait—actually, the rigid rotor model treats the bond length as fixed, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, right? Or maybe I'm mixing that up. Wait, the question says it's the rotation-vibration model, which probably combines rotational and vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, both vibrationally and rotationally. So, the molecule is at the lowest possible energy. Now, when it absorbs a photon, it needs to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means it will move to the next higher energy state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational excitation. But wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy," which makes me think that it's the first possible excited state, probably the first vibrational level or the first rotational level.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, transitions are usually considered in terms of selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational transitions have specific selection rules. For vibration, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and for rotation, it's ΔJ = ±1. But the energy of the photon required depends on the energy difference between the states.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right! The photon's momentum is related to its energy. Since photons are massless and move at the speed of light, their momentum p is equal to E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light. So, if I can find the energy difference between the initial and final states, I can find the momentum.

But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. So, the initial state is v=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). When a photon is absorbed, it can cause either a vibrational transition (v increases by one) or a rotational transition (J increases by one). But which transition requires less energy? Because the question asks for the photon with the momentum that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So, I need to calculate the energy of the first vibrational state (v=1) and the energy of the next rotational state (J=1), compare them, and see which one is lower. The photon's energy would match the lower of these two, because that's the next possible state with the least energy increase.

Wait, no—wait. The fundamental state is when both vibrational and rotational are in their lowest states. To get the next state with the lowest energy, the molecule could either go to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which of these has lower energy?

I think the vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the vibrational angular frequency. Similarly, the rotational energy levels are
