Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs, ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question lists five stars, each with different properties. The key point is to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both spectrographs. From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, so apparent V magnitude less than 17. HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than 16.5, I think. Wait, no, wait. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO, meaning that if the apparent V is less than 17, it's observable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16, so less than 16.

Wait, no, wait. Magnitudes are tricky. Higher magnitude means dimmer. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16 (brighter than 16 mag), but wait the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Wait no, the question says: "ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag." Wait, that's confusing. Because in astronomy, a brighter star has a lower apparent magnitude. So if a star's V mag is 17, that's 17th magnitude, which is dimmer than magnitude 16. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means its apparent magnitude is <17.

So for ESPRESSO, the stars must have apparent V mag less than 17. For HIRES, the stars must have apparent V mag less than 16. So, for a star to be observed by both
