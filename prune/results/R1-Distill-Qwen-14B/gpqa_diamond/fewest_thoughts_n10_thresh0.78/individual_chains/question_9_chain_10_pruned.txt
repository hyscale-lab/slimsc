Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but let me try to work through it.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a certain kind of symmetry. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Wait, or is it a combination of rotation and reflection? I think C3h is part of the point group symmetries. Point groups include various operations like identity, rotations, reflections, etc.

So the molecule must have a three-fold rotational symmetry and also a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's that the molecule's symmetry includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal reflection. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions, but I'll try to think about each option.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. The structure is a trigonal bipyramidal? No, wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar maybe? Or maybe it's more about the structure. The boron is in the center, bonded to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is like CH(CH3)2. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Now, does it have C3h symmetry? Because if the three substituents are all the same and arranged symmetrically, then yes. Wait, C3h would require a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. Triisopropyl borate is symmetric with three identical groups around the central atom. So the molecule should have C3v symmetry maybe? Or C3h? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, C3h symmetry might involve a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. Wait, C3h in the point group is a combination of a C3 axis and an horizontal mirror plane. So for instance, the point group has a three-fold rotation and a σh. So the molecule should have a plane of symmetry and a three-fold axis. Let me think about triisopropyl borate. It's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Also, if
