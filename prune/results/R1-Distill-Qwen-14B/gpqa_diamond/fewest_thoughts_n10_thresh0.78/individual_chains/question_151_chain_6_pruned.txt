Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and they need to be normalized. Oh wait, but wait, are the given components the components of the state vector, or is it something else? Let me think. Oh, right, the state vector needs to have a norm (or length) of 1. So I should probably check whether this vector is normalized first.

The observable is given by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian operators, and P looks like it should be Hermitian. Let me check: the (1,2) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (2,1) element is also 1/sqrt(2), which is good. Similarly, the (1,3) and (3,1) are 0, so that's fine. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P yields 0. So, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator P. So first, I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of P.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the state is given, perhaps the measurement of P will give an eigenvalue, and the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and the corresponding eigenvector. Or wait, no, wait. The general approach is to find the eigenvalues of P, then for each eigenvalue, find the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenspace. The probability is the square of the norm of that projection.

But another approach is to compute the
