Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA's protonation or anything. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard conditions.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, what's the concentration of calcium ions? So, I'm trying to find [Ca²+]. 

I remember that when EDTA complexes with a metal ion, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given, which is the equilibrium constant for this reaction. K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Since EDTA is in excess, the concentration of free EDTA (EDTA^4-) is much higher than the calcium, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because K is so large (5e10), which means the complex is very stable and the reaction goes almost to completion.
