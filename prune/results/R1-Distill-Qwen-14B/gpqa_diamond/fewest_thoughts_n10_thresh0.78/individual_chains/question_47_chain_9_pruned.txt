Okay, so I need to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. Let's start by looking at all the information provided.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is zero. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and a double bond or a ring plus a double bond, or maybe an amide group.

Looking at the IR data: there are strong to medium bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. Since they are medium to strong, maybe it's an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide. Because amides have lower carbonyl wavenumbers, maybe around 1650-1700, but sometimes they can be a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester would have around 1720-1740, so that's a strong possibility.

Now, the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H) – this looks like a CH2CH3 group, maybe from an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests two neighboring protons, so perhaps (CH2)2.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) – this could be an OCH2 group, maybe in an ester or ether. Or perhaps a NH2 group, but the broadness suggests it's not an NH because in amides, the NH is usually a broad peak, but for OCH2, maybe. Alternatively, if it's an amine, but considering the IR has N-H, maybe it's an amide.

4.5 ppm quartet (2H) – quartet implies each proton has two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Perhaps an ester's OCH2CH2 or something like that. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the structure would be OCH2CH3. But wait, the ethyl group is usually split into a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. But in this NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is more like an OCH2, perhaps adjacent to something else.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the two doublets are each integrating 2H, probably ortho to each other. So the substituents are on the para positions. Wait, no, wait: if it's a para substitution, then the substituents are opposite each other. So the coupling would be between H on adjacent carbons. So two doublets, each 2H, probably in a para arrangement. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if the substituent is an OCH2CH3 group.

Wait, putting it together: the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests that they are adjacent to substituents. Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, the H's on either side would be equivalent. Let me think: if substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic H's would be in positions ortho and meta to the substituent. Wait, no—wait, if the substituent is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is para. So for a para-substituted benzene, the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be next to substituent at 1, and if the substituent is something like OCH2CH3, then those H's (2 and 6) would couple with each other and perhaps with another substituent.

Wait, but the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each have 2H. So maybe it's a substituent in the para position, but the actual coupling is between the two sets. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent in the para position, and the ring has another substituent adjacent to it.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position, and the ring is part of a di-substituted benzene. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let
