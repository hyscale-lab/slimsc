Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like after a series of reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are:

- At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group. So that's a -CH2OH attached to the cyclohexanone ring at carbon 3.
- At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as an isopropenyl group. So that's a CH2-C(CH2) group. Wait, no, actually, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-C=, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure is CH2-C(CH2-) with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the group is CH2-C(CH2-)=, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2C-, but with a double bond between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So, the prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at C1, but attached at C2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CH-CH2- attached at the middle carbon? Hmm, maybe I should just think of it as an isopropenyl group, which is CH2=C(CH2-)
