Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the reaction of ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene with hydrogen bromide. After the reaction, they checked using TLC and saw two new spots besides the diminished reactant spot. I need to figure out what the products are.

First, let me visualize the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So, the structure looks like this: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. But the but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait no, but that's but-1-ene, but but-3-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but that can't be right because but is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's actually impossible because the double bond can't be at position 3 in a four-carbon chain because that would be beyond the end. Oh wait, maybe I'm numbering wrong. Let me see: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Because but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that seems confusing. Let me draw it: the group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond from C3 to C4, but that's not possible because the chain is only four carbons. So perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Alternatively, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait. Wait, the structure is but-3-en-1-yl: the substituent is attached to the first carbon of but-3-en-1-yl, which is a four-carbon chain with double bond starting at 3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4, but but has only four carbons, so it can't have a double bond beyond the third. So maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3, which would make it but-1-en-3-yl or something else? I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me take a step back.

The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy benzene. So the substituent on the benzene is an ether group, O-(but-3-en-1-yl), and that butenyl group has two methyl groups on the second carbon. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but that doesn't make sense for the double bond. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that's not right either. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH-CH2, but that's not making sense. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the but-3-en-1-yl group as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4
