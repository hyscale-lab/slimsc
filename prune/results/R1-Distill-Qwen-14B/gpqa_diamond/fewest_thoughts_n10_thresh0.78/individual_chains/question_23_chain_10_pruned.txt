Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the options A to D are the possible products.

Hmm, so the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to draw that structure mentally. The benzene ring has an ether group (O) attached. The oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is 2,2-dimethyl, so the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, that's if it's a butyl. Wait, no, but in this case, it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but I think I might be getting the numbering wrong. Let me think. The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene? Wait no, wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that can't be right because but has four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the longest chain has four carbons, and the double bond starts at carbon 3. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait that can't be right because that would make it 1-3 but that's not possible. Oh wait,
