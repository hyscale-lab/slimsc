Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. 

The question says the astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip takes from their perspective. Wait, so we're dealing with proper time here, right? Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference, which in this case is the astronaut's perspective.

First, I need to figure out the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years. But wait, from the astronaut's frame, the distance would be contracted because of length contraction. Oh right, length contraction occurs in the direction of motion.

The formula for time dilation is T = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, since we're calculating time from the astronaut's perspective, maybe I should think about the proper time. Oh right, the proper time is the shortest time experienced by the traveler. So the time experienced by the astronaut (t') can be found using the formula t' = T / gamma, where T is the time measured in Earth's frame.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the time it takes to travel the distance at that speed from Earth's frame and then apply time dilation to find the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, let me think again. The distance is D, and the speed is v. From Earth's perspective, the time taken (T) would be D / v. But from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted, so the time they experience (t') is (D' ) / v. Hmm, or is it that the proper time is given by another formula?

Oh, right, the proper time tau (τ) is given by the equation:

τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

But wait, t is the time measured in Earth's frame, which is D / v. So tau = (D / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Alternatively, since tau is the proper time, we can compute it using the approximation for v ≈ c.

Wait, the speed v is 0.99999987 * c. That's extremely close to c. Let's compute gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's calculate v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.00051. So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me compute 0.99999987 squared. Hmm, 0.
