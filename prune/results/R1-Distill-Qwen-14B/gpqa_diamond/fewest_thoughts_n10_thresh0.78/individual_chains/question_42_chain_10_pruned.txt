Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand.

Astronomers are studying three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They found the equilibrium temperature ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2, and 1.35 between Planet2 and Planet3. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1, given that all have an albedo of 0.3, like Earth.

Hmm, so first I need to remember what the equilibrium temperature formula is. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is:

T_eq = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (R_star)/(a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but more commonly, it's expressed in terms of the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, if we're comparing planets around the same star, some terms cancel out. Since all three planets are in the same system, their star is the same, so L_star, R_star, and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for all.

So the equilibrium temperature T_eq for a planet is proportional to ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) * (1/a )^(1/2 ), where A is the albedo and a is the orbital radius (distance from the star). Since the albedo is the same for all three planets (0.3), that term is a constant. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between any two planets depends only on the square root of the inverse of their orbital radii.

Wait, so T_eq is proportional to ( (1 - A)^(1/4) ) * (1 / sqrt(a) ). But since A is the same for all, the ratio of T_eq between Planet1 and Planet2 is sqrt(a1/a2) inverse? Wait, let me think again.

If T_eq is proportional to (1/sqrt(a)), then T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T_eq1 = k / sqrt(a1), T_eq2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (sqrt(a2) )/( sqrt(a1) ) ) = sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, no, wait: T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So if Planet1 is at a1, Planet2 at a2, then T_eq1 = T_eq2 * sqrt(a2/a1).

So their ratio T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So if T_eq1 is larger than T_eq2, that would mean that a2 is larger than a1. Because
