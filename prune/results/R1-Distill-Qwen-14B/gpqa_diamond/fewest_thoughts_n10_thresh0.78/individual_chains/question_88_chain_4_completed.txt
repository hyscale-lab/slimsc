Okay, so I'm looking at this question about rotavirus and some processes happening in the mouse's immune system. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, when they looked in vivo, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, others got stuck in intestinal mucus. But then they found the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. 

Wait, what's happening here? So the Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're sites where immune responses are initiated, especially for things that are ingested or come into contact with the gut. So the GFP-tagged proteins probably got taken up by antigen-presenting cells or maybe even got to the Peyer patches directly.

The fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid might mean that some proteins didn't survive the acidic environment. But others might have made it through and gotten to the Peyer patches. Now, in the Peyer patches, those proteins would likely be processed and presented to the immune system, particularly B cells.

The cells they're isolating are the proliferating ones, so these are probably activated B cells. When B cells get activated, they start dividing and also undergo some processes that change their B cell receptors. Oh right, when B cells are activated, they undergo something called somatic hypermutation. That's where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, increasing the diversity and affinity of the antibodies produced.

So sequencing the variable heavy chain genes shows high variability, which makes sense because each B cell clone is undergoing hypermutation to produce more specific receptors. This process happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer patches. Germinal centers are sites where B cells proliferate, undergo selection, and this hypermutation occurs.

Looking at the options: 

A) Somatic hypermutation — that's what I was thinking. It leads to variability in the antibodies.

B) Complement activation — that's more about marking pathogens for destruction by phagocytes or causing lysis. I don't think that's directly related here.

C) Class switching recombination — that's when the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It does happen in activated B cells, but the question is about the variable regions having high variability, which points more to hypermutation than class switching.

D) VDJ recombination — that's during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow during development. It's a process that happens once when the B cell is formed, not during activation. So after that, the variable region is stable except for hypermutation.

So the process that explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain is somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.


The question involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins were observed to face challenges in the stomach (acid destruction) and intestinal mucus but eventually reached the Peyer patches, where fluorescent cells were isolated and sequenced for their variable heavy chain genes. The high variability observed in these genes suggests a process that increases the diversity of B cell receptors.

Peyer patches are sites of immune activation, particularly for antigens encountered in the gut. When B cells encounter an antigen, they become activated, proliferate, and undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, increasing the diversity and specificity of the B cell receptors. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the experiment aligns with this mechanism.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This is the process by which B cells introduce mutations into the variable regions of their receptors, leading to increased diversity and affinity. This matches the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves marking pathogens for destruction or lysis and is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable regions of the genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., IgM to IgG) but does not explain the variability in the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow and is not relevant to the observed post-activation variability.

The process responsible for the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is somatic hypermutation. 

Answer: A
