Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, which has a certain average photon energy. The question is about finding the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. 

Wait, I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions. When high-energy gamma-rays collide with CMB photons, they can produce electron-positron pairs. The lifetime of these gamma-rays would be limited because they're being annihilated into other particles. So the problem is asking at what gamma-ray energy this process becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

I recall that the typical energy scale for this kind of process involves the so-called threshold energy. At the threshold, the photon-photon collision just has enough energy to produce the rest mass of the particles—in this case, the electron and positron. Since an electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, each electron is 0.511 MeV, so pair production requires at least twice that energy because it's e+ and e-. Oh, wait no, because each photon must contribute at least the rest mass energy. But wait, in pair production via photon-photon collisions, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least twice the electron mass. 

Wait, no. Because when two photons collide to produce an electron-positron pair, each photon must have enough energy. The threshold condition is when the combined energy is sufficient. The center of mass energy (sqrt(s)) must be at least equal to twice the electron mass, because the rest mass of the pair is 2m_e c². So the threshold energy occurs when sqrt(s) = 2m_e c².

But wait, the CMB photons are low energy, so we need to calculate the energy of the gamma-ray photon that, when colliding with a CMB photon, the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c².

So let me think about the process. The gamma-ray photon has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy E_cm (but wait, the average is given as 1e-3 eV). So E_cm = 1e-3 eV.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the CMB photon has low energy, but the gamma-ray is high energy. To find the threshold condition, we need to calculate the minimum energy E of the gamma-ray such that when it collides with the CMB photon, the total energy is enough to create the pair.

The energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by the invariant s = (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - (p_γ c - p_cm c)^2, but considering that the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction to the gamma, perhaps? Or wait, no, in the lab frame, the CMB photon is moving in a direction, and the gamma is moving in another. Wait, maybe it's easier to use the formula for the threshold condition.

I remember that the threshold energy for a photon-photon collision to produce an electron-positron pair is given by E_γ * E_cm ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Because each photon's energy contributes to the center-of-mass energy. So the product of the two photon energies must be at least (m_e c²)^2 /4. 

Wait, let me think. The center-of-mass energy squared (s) is (E_γ + E_cm)^2 minus (their momenta times c times (1 - cos θ))^2. Wait, but when the photons are moving head-on, the angle between them is 180 degrees, so cosθ is -1. So the momentum terms would add in magnitude. 

Wait, the invariant s is given by s = (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - (p_γ c - (-p_cm c))^2, since the CMB photon's momentum is in the opposite direction. So p_cm is the magnitude of the CMB photon's momentum. Similarly, p_γ is E_γ / c. But for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/(c). 

So substituting, s = (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - ( (E_γ/(c) ) + (E_cm/(c)) )^2 c².

Wait, no, let me get the units right. The term p_γ c is E_γ, and p_cm c is E_cm. So when the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momentum vectors are opposite, so their magnitudes add. So the spatial part is (p_γ c + p_cm c)². 

So s = (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - (E_γ + E_cm)^2 = 0? That can't be right. Wait, that would imply s is zero, which can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the momenta.

Wait, the CMB photons are isotropic, but for the purpose of the threshold condition, the most probable direction is where the two photons collide head-on. So in that case, the momenta are in opposite directions. So the invariant s would be (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - (E_γ - E_cm)^2. 

Wait, let me re-calculate that. The invariant s is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

E_total = E_γ + E_cm.

p_total c = p_γ c - p_cm c, if they are moving in opposite directions. But wait, the direction matters. If the gamma is moving in +x, and the CMB photon is moving in -x, then the momentum of the CMB photon is -p_cm. So p_total = p_γ - p_cm (since p_cm is in the opposite direction, hence the negative sign).

So (p_total c) = (E_γ/c - E_cm/c) * c = E_γ - E_cm. 

So, s = (E_γ + E_cm)^2 - (E_γ - E_cm)^2.

Expanding that: (E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_cm + E_cm²) - (E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_cm + E_cm²) ) 

= 4 E_γ E_cm.

So s = 4 E_γ E_cm.

And for the process to happen, the invariant s must be ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2, since the total rest mass is 2 m_e c². 

So 4 E_γ E_cm ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2.

Divide both sides by 4:

E_γ E_cm ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

So E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cm.

So, E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cm.

Wait, but m_e c² is 0.511 MeV. So let's plug in the numbers.

Given that E_cm is 1e-3 eV.

First, convert m_e c² to eV. 0.511 MeV is 0.511e6 eV.

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 (eV)^2.

E_cm is 1e-3 eV.

So E_γ ≥ (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Calculating numerator: 0.511e6 squared is (0.511)^2 * (1e6)^2 = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: E_γ ≥ 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 TeV. Wait, but looking at the options, the highest option is 3.9e5 GeV. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e5 GeV. Because 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV, D is 3.9e5 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation.

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 *1e12 = approx 0.261 *1e12 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

E_cm is 1e-3 eV.

So E_γ = (2.61e11) / (1e-3) = 2.61e14 eV.

Convert eV to GeV: 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 = 2.61e5 GeV. 

Which is approximately 2.6e5 GeV, matching option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula we derived was E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (E_cm). But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check.

Yes, m_e c^2 is in eV, E_cm is in eV. So E_γ has units of eV.

So yes, 2.61e5 GeV. So the correct answer would be 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

But wait, I think there's another factor I might have missed. The cross-section for photon-photon pair production peaks at this threshold, but maybe the calculation isn't so straightforward because the CMB is a bath of photons, so the average photon energy is about 1e-3 eV. So perhaps the calculation I did is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the photon's energy in the center-of-momentum frame. Hmm, but I think the approach I took is correct for the threshold condition.

So putting this together, the gamma-rays with energy ≈ 2.6e5 GeV will have their lifetimes limited by this process. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of high-energy γ-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process occurs when the combined energy of the γ-ray and a CMB photon is sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair. 

The invariant quantity $s$ in the center-of-mass frame is given by:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (p_\gamma c - p_{\text{CMB}} c)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ are the energies of the γ-ray and CMB photon, respectively, and $p_\gamma$ and $p_{\text{CMB}}$ are their momenta. For photons, $E = pc$, so $p_\gamma = E_\gamma / c$ and $p_{\text{CMB}} = E_{\text{CMB}} / c$. Substituting these into the expression for $s$, we find:

\[
s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2 - (E_\gamma - E_{\text{CMB}})^2 = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
\]

For the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ to occur, the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ must be at least equal to the total rest energy of the pair, $2m_e c^2$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. Thus, the threshold condition is:

\[
\sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2.
\]

Substituting $s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}$, we get:

\[
4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2m_e c^2)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The electron rest energy is $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, and the average photon energy of the CMB is $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting these values:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV}.
\]

First, calculate $(0.511 \times 10^6)^2$:

\[
(0.511 \times 10^6)^2 = (0.511)^2 \times (10^6)^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2.
\]

Now divide by $10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Convert $E_\gamma$ from eV to GeV:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{14}}{10^9} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of the γ-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$**.
