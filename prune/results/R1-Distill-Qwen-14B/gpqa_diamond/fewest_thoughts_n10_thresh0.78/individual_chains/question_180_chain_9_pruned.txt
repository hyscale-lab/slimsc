Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, each has a charge of 2e, which is twice the elementary charge. So each is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That would make each charge 3.2e-19 C. Right?

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. So, all twelve are sitting on a sphere of radius 2 meters, centered at P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. So, the setup is that one charge is at the center, and twelve are on the surface around it. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated considering each pair. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But wait, since the system is isolated, the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges. Because each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Wait, but in this problem, some charges are fixed. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the twelve are fixed at 2m from P. So, the twelve charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the thirteenth charge is located.

Let me think about the different pairs contributing to the potential energy.

First, the charge at P (let's call it Q) interacts with each of the twelve charges on the sphere (each q). Then, the twelve charges on the sphere also interact with each other. So the total potential energy U_total would be the sum of the energy due to Q and each of the twelve charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the twelve charges.

Wait, but wait. When you calculate the potential energy of a system of charges, you have to consider each unique pair once. So the formula for the total potential energy U is:

U = (1/2) * sum_{i < j} [k * (q_i * q_j) / r_{ij} ]

But in this case, because all the twelve charges are identical and arranged symmetrically, perhaps the calculation can be simplified.

Let me break it down:

1. Potential energy between the central charge (Q) and each of the twelve charges on the sphere.

2. Potential energy between each pair of charges on the sphere.

So the total potential energy U will be the sum of these two contributions.

Let me calculate each part separately.

First, the central charge Q is 2e. Each of the twelve charges is also 2e. So each charge on the sphere is 2e, and the central charge is 2e.

Wait
