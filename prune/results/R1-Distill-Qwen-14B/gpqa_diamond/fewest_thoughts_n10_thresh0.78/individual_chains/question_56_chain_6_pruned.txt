Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options are A to D, each showing a possible transition route and a probability. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that in hydrogen, the states are described by the principal quantum number n, the angular momentum l, and the magnetic quantum number m. The notation is |n, l, m⟩. So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays to n=1, l=0, m=0. But it goes through two dipole transitions. Oh right, because going from 3 to 1 would require two steps, each changing n by at most 1 since dipole transitions only allow Δn = ±1.

So the first transition must go from n=3 to n=2. Then the second step goes from n=2 to n=1. Each transition can change l by ±1 or 0, but for dipole transitions, I think the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Wait, is Δm only 0, ±1? I think so, because dipole transitions are due to electric dipole moments which involve angular momentum changes of up to one unit.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The possible transitions from n=3 (l=0) would have to go to l=1 in the next state. Because l can't stay the same or go beyond a change of ±1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the first step could be |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but when you go from l=0 to l=1, the m can change by 0, ±1. So possible m values after the first transition are m = 0 ± 0, ±1? So from m=0, the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. So the first step could be to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition from n=2 (l=1) to n=1. What's allowed here? Since l has to change by ±1 again. From l=1, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the final state is l=0, so the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So the second step is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0, m'⟩.

Again, applying the selection rules for m: m can change by 0, ±1. So for the second step, m in |2,1,m⟩ can become m' = m ±0, ±1. But wait, the final state must have m=0 because the initial was |3,0,0⟩ and the final is |1,0,0⟩. So the second transition must have m' =0.

Looking at the options, let's see each one.

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. So first transition changes l from 0 to 1, m stays 0. Then the second transition changes n from 2 to 1, l from 1 to 0, and m from 0 to 0. So the second transition is allowed because m can stay 0 (since Δm=0 is allowed).

Option B: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. First transition: m goes from 0 to +1. Second transition: m must go from +1 to 0. That's allowed because Δm is -1. So the second step is allowed.

Option C: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩. Similarly, m goes from 0 to -1 first, then to 0. That's allowed.

Option D: The first part says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, which is the same as option A. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, wait, looking back, option D says "⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩"—wait, maybe the initial state is missing? Looking at the options, perhaps I misread. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

B) 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0 and 1/4.

C)3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0 and 1/4.

D) It starts with "⟩", which I think is a typo. Looking at the options, perhaps D is the same as A but with a different probability. Wait, the user wrote option D as:

D) |3,0,0⟩\rightarrow|2,1,0\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle and \frac{2}{3}.

Ah, okay, so D is similar to A but with a probability of 2/3.

So each of A, B, C, D has their own transition paths and probabilities.

Now, the problem is about the transition probabilities. So which of these paths is allowed, and which has the correct probability.

Wait, but wait, the question says "The transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So I need to find which pair of transitions is allowed, and which has the correct probability.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the allowed transitions. So let me think about each option.

First, for the initial state |3,0,0⟩:

In the first dipole transition, to go to n=2, l must be 1, because l can change by ±1. So the possible states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

So in the first transition, the state could go to any of these three possibilities.

Then, in the second transition, from n=2 (l=1) to n=1 (l=0).

In this step, for l=1 → l=0, the change is allowed because Δl = -1.

For m, the m in the second state can be m' = m ±0, ±1.

But the final state must have m=0. So the second transition's m' must be 0.

So the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ must have m' =0.

So let's see each case:

If first step is |2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩: m was 0, so m' can be 0, ±1, but in the final state, m' must be 0. So Δm can be 0. So that's allowed.

If first step is |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: m was 1, so m' can be 0 (1-1=0) or 2 (but l=0, m can't be 2, since m ranges from -l to +l, which is -0 to +0). So in this case, m' can only be 0. So the transition from m=1 to m'=0 is allowed (Δm=-1).

Similarly, if first step is |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩: m was -1, so m' can be 0 (Δm=+1). So that's allowed.

So all three transition paths are allowed. So the decay could go through any of these three possible paths.

But the question is, which option shows the correct transition route and the correct probability.

Wait, but the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability. So which option is correct.

Wait, but the options are each giving a specific path and a specific probability. So for each option, the path and the probability should be correct.

But wait, how do you calculate the probability for each possible two-step transition?

I think the transition probability for each step would be the square of the transition dipole moment, which depends on the matrix elements. Alternatively, it could be based on the possible routes and the selection rules.

But I'm a bit rusty on the exact probabilities. Let me think.

When a state decays through two steps, each step has a certain probability, and the total probability is the product of each step's probability.

Wait, but in reality, each transition has certain possible paths, and each has a certain probability amplitude. The overall probability would be the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that the decay is via two dipole transitions. So the overall probability is the probability of the two-step process.

But perhaps each possible intermediate state (like |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩) has a certain probability, and the total is the sum of their contributions.

Alternatively, maybe each allowed transition path (like 3→2→1) has a certain probability, and we need to find which path has which probability.

But I'm a bit stuck on how to calculate the exact probability for each path.

Wait, perhaps the probability of each transition is determined by the square of the electric dipole matrix elements between the states.

The electric dipole transition probability is proportional to |⟨f| er |i⟩|², where er is the electric dipole operator (r times the charge factor etc.).

But for hydrogen, the dipole matrix elements can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and the associated integrals.

The selection rules for hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

But the actual probabilities depend on the overlap integrals. For example, the transition probability from |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to certain factors.

I recall that the probability for a transition between states with m changing by zero is higher than when m changes by ±1, because of the properties of the spherical harmonics integrals.

Alternatively, the matrix elements might depend on the product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner 3-j symbols.

Wait, looking at the dipole operator, which is proportional to r Y_{1m}, where m is -1, 0, +1.

When you compute the matrix element ⟨f | r Y_{1m} |i⟩, it's non-zero only if m satisfies the selection rules.

For example, the matrix element ⟨n', l', m' | r Y_{1m} |n, l, m⟩ is non-zero only if l' = l ± 1, and m' = m ± 1.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transition is between |n, l, m⟩ and |n', l', m'⟩, and the matrix element is non-zero only if l' = l ±1, and m' = m ±1 (including m'=m, m'=m+1, m'=m-1).

Wait, no. The operator is Y_{1m}, so when you multiply it with the initial state, the m can change by ±1 or 0. So the matrix element is non-zero only if m' = m + q, where q is -1, 0, +1.

But in our case, the initial state |3,0,0⟩ has m=0. So the first transition can go to m'=0, +1, or -1. Similarly, the second transition must go from whatever m' is in the intermediate state to m''=0 in the final state.

So for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m⟩,
