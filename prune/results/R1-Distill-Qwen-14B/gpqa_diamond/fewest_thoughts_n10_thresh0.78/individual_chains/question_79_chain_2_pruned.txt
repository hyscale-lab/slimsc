Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves an experiment where compound X (with the formula C11H12O) is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify what Compound X was from the options provided.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a catalyst used in the ring-opening of epoxides, right? Or wait, isn't that a base? Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's a bulky amine catalyst used in the ring-opening of epoxides, especially in the context of epoxide ring-opening reactions. So if compound X is reacting with this, maybe it's an epoxide that's undergoing some kind of reaction. But in this case, since the product's NMR is given, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, but wait, no—wait, let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is often used as a base in the ring-opening of epoxides, maybe via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. But in this case, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed opening? Or maybe in a nonpolar solvent, which would favor more of a SN2-like mechanism if it's a ring-opening. So, if Compound X is an epoxide, reacting under these conditions would lead to an opening. But wait, the product is the result of the reaction, so perhaps compound X is the epoxide that's being opened. Hmm.

But wait, the question is to identify the compound X, so perhaps the product's structure is known, and we need to backtrack to find X. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, so the product would have a different structure, maybe a diol or something else.

Wait, let's look at the NMR data. Let's start with the 1H NMR.

The 1H NMR has the following signals: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, two singlets for 3H each—probably two methyl groups. Then some aromatic protons. The aromatic region has four signals, but let me count: δ6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, maybe this is a substituted styrene or something with a benzene ring and substituents. Let's think about the 13C NMR. 13C NMR shows: 21
