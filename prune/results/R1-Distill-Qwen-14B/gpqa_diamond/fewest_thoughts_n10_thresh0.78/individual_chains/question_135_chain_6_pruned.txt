Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson, specifically the X boson. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about what this means. Oh right, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction term for a boson coupling to fermions typically looks like something with the fermion fields, a coupling constant, and the boson field. So here, X is interacting with various fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering the mass of X and the masses of the fermions involved.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the rest mass of the fermions plus any binding energy must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Since X is at rest, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to X's mass. Because for a decay into two particles, the threshold condition is that their combined rest mass is ≤ the mass of the decaying particle.

So the fermions that X can decay into must have each fermion's mass less than or equal to half of X's mass. Because for a pair like f and f̄, each has mass m_f, so 2 m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X / 2.

What's m_X? 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them:

- Up quark: around ~1.5 MeV (so 0.0015 GeV)
- Down quark: ~3.3 MeV (0.0033 GeV)
- Strange quark: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark: ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, ~173 GeV.
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.105 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV
- Also, for neutrinos, but their masses are negligible, so not relevant here.

Wait, so let me think. The fermions that X can decay into are those with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's see each fermion:

Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV – definitely allowed.
Muon (mu): 0.105 GeV – allowed.
Tau (tau): 1.777 GeV – allowed.
Charm quark (c): 1.3
