Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it out.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

First, I should probably note down all the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: 300 GeV. So, the rest mass M is such that Mc² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². But since we're dealing with mass ratios, maybe I don't need to calculate actual masses but just work with proportions.

- After fission, two fragments: let's call their rest masses m1 and m2. It's given that m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, M is the initial mass. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M? Because the sum is 99% of the initial mass. So that leaves 1% unaccounted for, which would be the mass converted into kinetic energy and possibly binding energy or other forms, but since the problem says to ignore electrons, perhaps we can assume that the rest mass of the fragments is 99% of M, and the remaining 1% is the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in reality, during fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. So the total energy after fission is the sum of rest masses plus kinetic energies. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total energy before is just its rest mass energy (300 GeV). After fission, the total energy would be (m1 + m2)c² + K1 + K2, where K1 and K2 are the kinetic energies of the two fragments. Since energy is conserved, 300 GeV = [ (m1 + m2)c² ] + (K1 + K2).

But wait, the problem says that the sum of rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. So 300 GeV = (0.99 M)c² + (K1 + K2). But the initial Mc² is 300 GeV, so 300 GeV = 0.99 * 300 GeV + (K1 + K2). Let me compute that: 0.99 * 300 is 297 GeV. So 300 = 297 + (K1 + K2), so the sum of kinetic energies is 3 GeV. So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV
