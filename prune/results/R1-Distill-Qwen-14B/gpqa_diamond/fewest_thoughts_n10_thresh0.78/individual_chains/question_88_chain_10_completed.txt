Okay, so I'm trying to answer this science question, and I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a rotavirus experiment. They tagged the inner capsid proteins with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid, others entangled in mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is which process is taking place.

Hmm, so first, let's recall some immunology concepts. Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gastrointestinal tract. Peyer's patches are specialized structures in the small intestine's mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). They're important for immune responses, especially against pathogens that enter through the gut.

The inner capsid proteins being tagged with GFP probably means they're part of the viral particles. When given by oral gavage, the rotavirus would normally infect the gut. But the GFP probably helps track where these proteins end up in the body.

The fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid suggests that some proteins didn't survive the acidic environment of the stomach. Others got stuck in the mucus, which is a common barrier in the gut to trap pathogens before they reach deeper tissues. But then some made it to the Peyer's patches, which are sites where immune cells, like dendritic cells and B cells, are present.

They isolated the proliferating cells from these patches. Proliferation often happens in lymphoid tissues when an immune response is triggered. So these cells are likely B cells that have been activated by the rotavirus capsid proteins.

Now, the key part is the sequencing result: high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in B cell receptors (BCRs) usually points to a process that generates diversity among the B cells.

Thinking about the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of the BCRs, increasing diversity.

B) Complement activation: This is part of the innate immune response, leading to opsonization or lysis of pathogens. It involves the complement system and doesn't directly cause variability in the variable chains.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the variable regions themselves. It's more about function.

D) VDJ recombination: This happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the variable region. But this is a one-time event during B cell development, not during an immune response.

Wait, but wait. VDJ recombination is during the maturation of B cells, generating initial diversity. Somatic hypermutation happens later, during the immune response, leading to further diversification.

So in this experiment, the B cells are being activated, proliferating, and their variable regions are showing high variability. That suggests that they're undergoing somatic hypermutation. Because when a B cell is activated, it undergoes division in germinal centers, and during each division, mutations are introduced into the variable regions. This allows the immune system to generate a diverse set of B cells, which can recognize different parts of the antigen and lead to a stronger immune response.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but another thought: Peyer's patches are part of the GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue). They contain B cells, T cells, dendritic cells. When an antigen is presented here, B cells get activated, leading to their proliferation. Since the variable regions are diverse, it's after the initial VDJ recombination, so the process during the immune response would be somatic hypermutation.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence observations reveal that some proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. These patches are specialized immune structures in the gut that detect and respond to pathogens. The fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells shows high variability.

High variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that generates diversity among B cell receptors (BCRs). The key options are:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of BCRs to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the experiment.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of BCRs.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the variable regions of the BCR.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow but does not account for the observed variability during the immune response.

Since the experiment involves an immune response in Peyer's patches and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes occurs after B cell activation, the process responsible is **somatic hypermutation**. This process explains the increased diversity of BCRs in the proliferating cell population.

Answer: A
