Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, wait, it's probably written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but I'm not entirely sure. But maybe that's the Yukawa interaction term. Oh right, Yukawa coupling is often between a scalar field (the boson) and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So we're to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, which fermions can X decay into?

First, I need to recall that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. So, the decay X → f f-bar is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

Wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV (so much less than 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but perhaps negligible.

Wait, but the question is about the fermions that X can couple to. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that seems off because the term should probably involve the boson X coupling to the fermion ψ_f. So maybe the interaction is something like ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling term, like L = λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which would imply that X couples to a pair of the same fermions.

Wait, in the Yukawa interaction, the coupling is typically between the scalar (like the Higgs) and two fermions. So for example, L = y X ψ ψ, where ψ is a Dirac fermion. So in this case, X would decay into ψ and
