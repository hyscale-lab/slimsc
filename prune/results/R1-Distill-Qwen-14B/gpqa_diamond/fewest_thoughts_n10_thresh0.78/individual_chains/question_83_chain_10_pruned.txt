Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this should be a classic acid-base titration problem.

Alright, let me read the details again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, let's break this down step by step. First, the initial solution after dilution. The initial concentration of acetic acid before titration. So, the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be volume × concentration. The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the concentration of acetic acid before adding any NaOH is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, we're adding a strong base to a weak acid. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-).

First, let's find the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH needed would equal the initial moles of acetic acid. The initial moles were 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M.

So, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. That's 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But the question first asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So, when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added, how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized? Let's see, 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid neutralized is 0.00025, which is 25% of the initial 0.001 mol. So that leaves 0.00075 mol of acetic acid unreacted, and 0.00025 mol of acetate ion produced.

Wait, the total volume at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ added NaOH. So volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentration of acetic acid is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. And the concentration of acetate is 0.00
