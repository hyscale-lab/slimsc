Okay, I have this astronomy question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. I remember that these spectrographs have different brightness limits. From what I understand, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, which means it can see stars up to about magnitude 17. HIRES, on the other hand, can go down to 16 V mag. So, a star must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO (because brighter is lower magnitude) and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no, wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, right, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that would mean magnitude less than 17, right? So for ESPRESSO, m < 17. For HIRES, m < 16. So the stars need to be visible by both, which means the apparent magnitude must be less than 16 (because 16 is the lower limit for HIRES, and anything dimmer than that wouldn't be visible by HIRES, but if it's brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO would see it too). So the stars must have apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag, meaning m <16.

Wait, but wait, the question says "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, so m <17. And "brighter than 16" for HIRES, so m <16. So to be detected by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than 16, because that satisfies both m <16 (so HIRES can see it) and m <17 (so ESPRESSO can see it).

Now, looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. To find apparent V magnitude, I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for Star1: d=10 pc, log10(10/10)=0, so m =15.5 + 0=15.5. So m=15.5, which is less than 16. So it's visible by both.

But wait, let me check the options. The options are A to D, each with two stars.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5. So m=16.5. HIRES can't detect it because it's only up to m <16. So Star2 is only visible by ESPRESSO if it's brighter than 17. 16.5 is less than
