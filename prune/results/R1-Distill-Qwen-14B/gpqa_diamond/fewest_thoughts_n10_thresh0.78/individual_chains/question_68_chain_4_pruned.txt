Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The setup involves a magnetic field changing direction, and we need to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment. 

Alright, let's parse the problem. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. After this switch, the average z-component of the moment starts oscillating, and we're to find the frequency of these oscillations.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have spin angular momentum, right? The magnetic moment is related to the spin via the gyromagnetic ratio gamma. So mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. But wait, the problem states mu = gamma * Sz. Hmm, that's a bit unusual because the magnetic moment usually has components in all three directions, not just z. So perhaps I need to think about this carefully.

Wait no, maybe the problem is saying that mu is aligned with Sz, so mu is along the z-axis. But when the magnetic field changes direction, the dynamics change. 

When the magnetic field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B. So H = -gamma Sz B, because B is along Z. The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z. The energy levels are E = ± (gamma B / 2) * ħ ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about units. Spin matrices: Sz for spin-1/2 is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix sigma_z. So Sz = (ħ/2) sigma_z. So gamma would have units of (rad/s per T) or something like that, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, perhaps I should just think in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, in the first scenario, when the magnetic field is along Z, the system is in an eigenstate, so the energy is definite. Now, when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. So the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. So H' = -gamma (Sz) * B for Y direction? No, wait, the direction of the magnetic moment is along the spin direction. Oh wait, no, in a magnetic field, the magnetic moment tends to align with the field. But the Hamiltonian in terms of spin is H = -γ B · S. Oh wait, wait, the correct expression is H = -γ B · S, because the energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment (proportional to S) and the magnetic field. So in this case, when B is along Z, H = -γ B Sz. 

So initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, when the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H' = -γ B Sy. Because now the magnetic field is along Y, so the direction of the spin component that matters is Sy.

So the system's time evolution after the field switch is governed by H'. The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, which is not an eigenstate of H'. So the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking for ⟨mu_z⟩ as a function of time, and its frequency.

Since mu = gamma * Sz, then mu_z is gamma times Sz. So ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨Sz⟩. So if we can find the frequency of ⟨Sz⟩, then we can find the frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩.

So let's model this. The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the state is |+z⟩, which is spin-up along z. So before
