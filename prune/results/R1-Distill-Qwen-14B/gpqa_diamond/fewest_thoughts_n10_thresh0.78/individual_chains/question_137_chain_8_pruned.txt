Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron used to accelerate particles, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where Φ0 is π/4 and U0 is 190 kV. The options are various numbers of revolutions, and I need to find out how many the proton makes.

Wait, I think in a cyclotron, charged particles move in a magnetic field, and they get accelerated by an electric field that alternates in a way to keep them in resonance as they gain speed. For a synchrocyclotron, I remember that the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particles gain energy. Unlike a regular cyclotron, which has a fixed frequency, the synchrocyclotron's frequency changes to keep the resonance condition as the particles move faster.

The key here might be understanding the resonance condition. The cyclotron's frequency must match the particle's rotation frequency. The formula I recall is something like the frequency ν is proportional to the particle's momentum. Oh right, the cyclotron resonance condition is given by ν = (qB)/(2πm) * gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So as the particle's speed increases (gamma increases), the frequency also increases. That's why the applied voltage's frequency ν(α) changes with the particle's momentum.

Wait, but in the problem, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency ν(α) is a function of the particle's momentum. So the proton is accelerated each time it passes through the electric field region, and each acceleration happens when the voltage is at its peak, I think.

Now, the problem is to find the number of revolutions the proton makes. Each time it goes around the magnet, it's a revolution, and during each revolution, it's accelerated once. So the number of revolutions should be equal to the number of times it's accelerated, which I think relates to the number of times the voltage completes a cycle as the proton is moving.

Wait, but how does the time relate to the number of revolutions? Let's think about the time taken for the proton to reach the final energy.

The kinetic energy gained is 950 MeV. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately 950 MeV. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is roughly 12 MeV higher than the rest mass. Therefore, the Lorentz factor gamma would be (E)/m_p c². Let me compute that.

E = 950 MeV, m_p c² = 938 MeV. So gamma = E/(m_p c²) ≈ 950 / 938 ≈ 1.0128. Oh, so gamma is about 1.0128. So the momentum p is gamma m_p v, but since gamma is close to 1, v is approximately 0.99c or something? Wait, but maybe we can approximate p ≈ gamma m_p v ≈ gamma m_p c, since v is close to c for high energies, but this might not be necessary yet.

The cyclotron frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is ω = (qB)/(gamma m_p). Because the resonance condition is when the applied voltage's frequency matches the cyclotron frequency. So as the particle gains energy, gamma increases, so the required frequency ν decreases. Wait, no, wait: earlier I thought that for the cyclotron, the frequency increases as gamma increases because higher gamma leads to higher required frequency. Or was it the opposite?

Wait, cyclotron frequency is omega = (qB)/(m), but in the relativistic case, it's adjusted by the Lorentz factor. So the resonance condition is when the applied frequency equals the cyclotron frequency, which is (qB)/(2π gamma m_p). So ν = (qB)/(2π gamma m_p). So as gamma increases (as the proton gains energy), the required frequency ν decreases. That makes sense because the cyclotron frequency decreases as the particle's mass increases relativistically.

So the acceleration happens each time the proton goes around the magnet and the electric field is applied. The number of revolutions would equal the number of times the proton is accelerated. Each acceleration step gives a certain amount of energy. So perhaps I need to compute how many times the voltage is applied (number of cycles) until the proton reaches 950 MeV.

But how much energy is gained per revolution? The energy gained per step is equal to the potential difference times the charge. The charge of a proton is e, so each step gives e * U0 (since U0 is the amplitude of the voltage, assuming that the maximum energy transfer occurs when the voltage is at its peak). Wait, but the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). So the maximum voltage is U0, so each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e*U0 of energy. Because the potential difference is e times the voltage, and the kinetic energy gained is e U0 per revolution.

Wait, but wait: the voltage is applied in an alternating fashion, so each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once, either positive or negative. But in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates in phase
