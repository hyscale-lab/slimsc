Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and they say to approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Wait, right. So when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So maybe I can think of this as a circular aperture problem.

Wait, but in the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is a series of concentric circles with intensity variations. The central maximum is the brightest, and the first minimum occurs at a certain angle. But wait, this isn't exactly the same because the polygon's apothems are all length 'a'. I should think about what 'a' represents here.

In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon with N sides, as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' would be the same as the radius of the circumscribed circle, right? Because each side becomes infinitesimally small, and the distance from the center to the side (the apothem) is essentially the radius of the circle the polygon approximates.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. So a ≈ R for large N. So in the limit of N→infinite, a is approximately equal to R. So the radius R of the circular aperture is about 'a' in this case.

So, the problem reduces to finding the angular separation between the first two minima in the single-slit diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. Wait, no, wait. Hold on. Wait, no, wait. No, that's not quite right. Wait, the single-slit diffraction gives the minima at certain conditions, but for a circular aperture, it's a bit different. Oh wait, wait, no. The problem refers to the far field, which is the Fraunhofer diffraction.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle θ given by the condition that the phase difference is a multiple of π. Wait, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is a bit different. I think for the first minimum, the condition is sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a single slit of width 'd', the minima occur at d sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer. The first minimum is at m=1, so θ ≈ λ/(d) [since for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ].

But in this problem, the aperture is a regular N-gon with apothem 'a'. As N becomes very large, it's
