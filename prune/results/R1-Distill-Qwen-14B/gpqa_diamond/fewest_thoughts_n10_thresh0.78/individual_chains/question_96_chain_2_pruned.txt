Okay, so I've got this problem here about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon at a certain distance and asks for the order of magnitude of the entropy. Hmm. So first, I need to find the mass of the black hole, because entropy of a black hole is related to its area and mass. Oh wait, the formula I remember is that the entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. Specifically, I think the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's constant ħ, gravitational constant G, Boltzmann constant k_B, and the speed of light c.

So to find S, I need A, the area of the event horizon. The event horizon radius is R_s/2, where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. Oh wait, right, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by (2 G M)/(c²). So R_s = 2 G M / c². So the area A would be 4 π (R_s/2)^2, which simplifies to π R_s². So A = π (2 G M / c²)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The area of a sphere is 4πr². The event horizon radius is r = R_s/2. So the area A = 4 π (R_s/2)^2 = π R_s². Since R_s is 2GM/c², substituting, A becomes π (2GM/c²)^2. So A = π (4 G² M²)/(c^4). So A = (4 π G² M²) / c^4.

So now, to find the entropy, S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B). Substituting A into that, S = [ (4 π G² M² / c^4 ) * c^3 ] / (4 ħ G k_B )

Let's simplify that. The numerator becomes 4 π G² M² c^3 / c^4 = 4 π G² M² / c.

So S = (4 π G² M² / c) / (4 ħ G k_B )

The 4s cancel out, so S = π G M² / (c ħ k_B )

Hmm, that looks manageable. So S = (π G M²) / (c ħ k_B )

Alternatively, I can think of entropy in terms of the Schwarzschild radius. Another approach is to remember that the entropy S is (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), so maybe I should compute A first.

But to get A, I need the radius, which depends on the mass. So I need to find M, the
