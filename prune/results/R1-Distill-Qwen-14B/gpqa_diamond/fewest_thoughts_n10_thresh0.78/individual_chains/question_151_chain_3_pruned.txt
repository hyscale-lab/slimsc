Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular observable and getting a specific value. 

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, quantum states are usually represented as vectors, right? So I think this is a state vector, probably in a three-dimensional space since there are three components. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of a state vector are complex numbers, right? But here, all the elements are real. Oh well, maybe that's okay.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. 

The question is to calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield 0. 

Okay, so in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix P. Because the possible results are the eigenvalues, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's components projected onto the state vector.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact
