Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay probabilities. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. 

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. But in this case, we're looking at a single atom, and 50 minutes have already gone by without decay. Now we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait, no. The next 150 minutes—does that mean from the current time, adding 150, making it a total of 200 minutes from the start? Or is it the next 150 minutes after the 50 have passed? Oh right, the question says after 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 minutes would take the total time to 200 minutes.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of half-lives or the decay constant. Let me recall the formula. The probability that an atom has decayed by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Alternatively, the probability of not decaying is e^(-λt). 

So the problem gives us that in 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, so P(100) =
