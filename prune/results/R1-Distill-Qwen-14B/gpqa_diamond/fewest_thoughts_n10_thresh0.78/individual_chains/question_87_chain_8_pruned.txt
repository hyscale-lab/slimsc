Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So the ring itself has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 more, making 8 in total. But wait, no, the substituents could be more complicated. Wait, each substituent is attached to the ring. So if the ring has 6 carbons, and it's di-substituted, the substituents would account for 2 more carbons. Hmm, but the total is 8, which suggests that each substituent can't have more than one carbon each. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has one? Let me think.

Wait, no. The ring is 6 carbons, so substituents add to that. So if the substituents are, say, a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is O=C-R) and another group, maybe a halogen. But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

So each substituent is one atom? No,
