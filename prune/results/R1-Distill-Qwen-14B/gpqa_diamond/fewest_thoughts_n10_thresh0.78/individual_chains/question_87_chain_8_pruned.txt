Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the compound has both a carbonyl and a halogen substituent on the aromatic ring.

Hmm, the possible structures that fit this could be something like an aromatic ketone with a halogen. Let's think: a 6-membered ring (like benzene) substituted with two groups, one being a carbonyl (maybe an acyl group?), and another being a halogen.

Wait, wait. Wait, the total carbons are 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, if it's di-substituted, each substituent could be one carbon each, but wait, maybe one substituent is larger.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone (like a methyl ketone), and another is a halogen. Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a ketone (like a carbonyl) and a halogen, but wait, the carbonyl would be part of a substituent. Let's consider that the ring has a ketone substituent and a halogen substituent. But wait, a ketone substituent would be something like a carbonyl attached to the ring, perhaps as a methyl ketone (like a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group). Wait, but that might not add up to the total carbons.

Wait, the ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2 more. So substituents could be, for example, one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone, maybe a group like COCH3?), but wait, that would be more than one carbon. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a larger substituent.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group like a ketone (e.g., a phenyl ketone) and a halogen. Let me try to sketch this out.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. So each substituent is attached to the ring. For the carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone group, such as a benzoyl group, but that might not fit the carbon count.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so substituents account for 2 more. For example, each substituent might be a single carbon each.

Let me think: substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone, R-CO-) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). But wait, the carbonyl group would have only one substituent. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached as an acyl group (like Ar-CO-R
