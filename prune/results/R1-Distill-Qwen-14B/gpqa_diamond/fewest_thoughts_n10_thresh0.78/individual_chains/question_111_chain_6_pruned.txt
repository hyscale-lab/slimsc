Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it probably induces some kind of elimination or maybe a conjugate addition? Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh right, in the presence of a base, maybe a Michael addition occurs here. Or wait, no, Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the other reactant is a ketone. So maybe it's a Claisen or another type of addition.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Wait, no, the positions: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So the carbonyl is at position 1, the ring has a substituent at position 2 (ethyl) and two methyl groups at positions 2 and 6? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: The numbering would be 1 is the carbonyl, then 2 is next to it. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl? Wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1. Position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group. Position 6 also has a methyl group.

Wait, that would make the structure: at position 1, carbonyl group; position 2: ethyl and methyl substituents; position 6: methyl. So the ring is substituted at 2, 6, and 1 (carbonyl). Hmm, okay.

Now, reacting this with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. t-BuOK is a
