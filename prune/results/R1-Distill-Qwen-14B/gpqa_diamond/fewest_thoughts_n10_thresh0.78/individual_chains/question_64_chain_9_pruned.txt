Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's happening.

So, we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. That probably means it's a decomposition reaction. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. 

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 grams.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change weight.
- Tube 3 (red-hot copper) gains 0.80 grams, and CuO is formed.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, heating salts A and B to 200°C without air. So probably thermal decomposition. The gases formed would be products of their decomposition.

The gases pass through the tubes. Let's think about each tube:

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant but also reacts with water vapor. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water, but in this case, it's anhydrous, so any water in the gas would be absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, and when it absorbs water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, which increases the mass. So the gain in weight (3.60g) is the mass of water absorbed.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react: CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3↓ + H2O. But since the weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present? Or perhaps the solution was saturated and couldn't absorb more. Or maybe the gas wasn't CO2. Alternatively, if the gas is something else, like H2 or N2, which don't react with Ca(OH)2, then no change makes sense.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. This probably reacts with a gas that can oxidize copper. For example, if there's H2, when passed over hot Cu, it might not react. But if the gas is O2 or SO2, maybe. Or perhaps the gas is a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2, but those are less likely. Alternatively, CO could react, but I'm not sure. Wait, the product is CuO, so the gas must be providing oxygen. But wait, another possibility: the gas could be SO2. When SO2 is passed over hot copper, it can react. Or, maybe the gas is H2S? No, that would form CuS perhaps, but the product is CuO. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2 or CO
