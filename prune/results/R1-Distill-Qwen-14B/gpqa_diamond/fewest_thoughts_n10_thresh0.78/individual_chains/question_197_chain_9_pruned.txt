Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question talks about Compound X, which has certain IR and NMR data. Then, it says that this compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the final product is from the given options.

First, I should probably look at the spectral data to figure out what Compound X is. Let's start with the IR.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range that might indicate O-H or N-H stretching. Since the compound is reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which I remember is a reaction typically for eliminating, maybe it's an alcohol or something with a good leaving group. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is a common reagent for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but wait, no, that's for ketones. Alternatively, I think that when an alcohol reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction, perhaps leading to an alkene. Or wait, maybe it's the formation of an imine? Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking more at the IR: there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Now the NMR. Let's go through each peak:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm, but wait, in the case of an acid, like a carboxylic acid, the -OH is usually around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 for an -OH (like it's a broad peak), but wait the 3400–2500 is a broad range. Oh, maybe that's an -OH or an -NH group. But considering the IR also has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, which fits, but the -OH is usually a broad peak in the 2500-3400 region. So the NMR shows a peak at 10.5. Could that be an aldehyde? Or maybe a carboxylic acid -OH. Wait, but acids have broad -OH signals, but in the NMR here, it's a broad singlet at 10.5. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde, but that's less common in some cases.

Wait, let me think again. The IR has a
