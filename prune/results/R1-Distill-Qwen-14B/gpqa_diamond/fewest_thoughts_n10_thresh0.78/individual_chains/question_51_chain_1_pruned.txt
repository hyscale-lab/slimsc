Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric potential energy, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system.

Hmm, the options are A to D, each involving some combination of k, q squared, R, and d. I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the product of charges and the distances between them.

Wait, wait. I think when you have a conducting sphere, especially a grounded one, the charges redistribute in a certain way. Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the charge resides on the surface. And if it's grounded, any induced charges would adjust accordingly.

So the setup has a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center of the sphere. The sphere is grounded, which means it's at zero potential, and electrons can move freely on its surface.

I'm trying to remember how the charges distribute. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges rearrange to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But since the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow to earth, so any induced charges on the sphere would adjust to maintain that condition.

Wait, if there's a charge q near the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground potential, which is zero. So the potential at the surface due to all charges (including q) must be zero.

But I'm trying to find the potential energy of the system. Potential energy in such cases is usually the work done to bring the charges together. So when we bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's charges rearrange, which changes the potential energy.

Alternatively, I recall that the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But in this case, we have a point charge and a conducting sphere with induced charges. But perhaps it's easier to model the conducting sphere as a point charge at its center when considering external potentials, because the induced charges would create a dipole-like effect when viewed from a distance.

Wait, no. For a conducting sphere, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface, so when you place a charge q outside, the sphere's induced charges create an image charge. Wait, the method of
