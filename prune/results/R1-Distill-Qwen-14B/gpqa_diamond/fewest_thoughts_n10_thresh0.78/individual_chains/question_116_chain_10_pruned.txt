Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about identifying a compound D formed through a series of reactions. The starting point is compound A. Let's start by figuring out what compound A is.

The proton NMR data for compound A: two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what could that be? I remember that triplet and quartet often come from splitting between adjacent groups. Let me think about common structures.

Triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H sounds like two sets of three H each. Wait, maybe it's two equivalent CH3 groups. And quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H... That makes me think of a CH2CH2 group, maybe connected to something else. Oh wait, what about neopentane? No, that's 2,2-dimethylpropane. Wait, no, that's actually 2-methylpropane. Hmm, maybe it's diethyl something?

Wait, diethyl ether has an NMR with two quartets, but that's when the splitting is from adjacent CH2 groups. Or perhaps it's not an ether. Let me think about another structure. Oh! Maybe it's cyclohexane with some substituents. Or perhaps it's something like diethyl ether but split differently.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that there are two equivalent CH3 groups each next to a CH2. Because a triplet would mean each CH3 is next to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Wait, maybe it's cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached in a way that their protons are equivalent.

Wait, no. Let me think of the NMR again. The triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm is typical for two ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has a triplet for the CH3 when attached to a CH2. Oh wait, no, the ethyl group's CH3 is a triplet when next to a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2, but if two ethyl groups are present in a symmetrical arrangement, maybe their CH3 would split into a triplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two CH3 groups are each adjacent to a CH2. For example, in diethyl ether (CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3), the CH3 groups are split into quartets because each is next to a CH2 with two Hs. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-methyl-2-pentene or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is a classic for two equivalent CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2.
