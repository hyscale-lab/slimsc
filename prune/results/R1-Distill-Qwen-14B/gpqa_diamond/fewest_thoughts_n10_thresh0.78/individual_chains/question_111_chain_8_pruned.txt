Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down into two parts because there are two reactions to consider.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as the base. The options give possible products for A. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to give product B. So I'll tackle each reaction separately.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one plus ethyl acrylate under basic conditions. I think this might be a Claisen or aldol condensation reaction. But wait, the starting material is a ketone, and ethyl acrylate is an ester with an α,β-unsaturated group. So perhaps it's a Michael addition or a nucleophilic attack.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugate addition. The enolate could form from the ketone. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's likely to deprotonate the less hindered position. The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. Let me visualize that structure. The cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). So the 2 position is substituted with ethyl and methyl, making the adjacent carbons (positions 1, 3) possibly hindered.

When the base deprotonates the ketone, it's going to form an enolate. The possible sites are the α-carbons. But with substituents at 2 and 6, the more accessible position might be position 3, perhaps. Wait, the ketone is at position 1 (since it's 1-one). So the carbonyl is at C1. So the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, so it's very substituted. C6 has a methyl. So the enolate formation would be at either C2 or C6, but which is more likely?

Wait, if the base is bulky, it'll prefer to abstract a proton from a less hindered site. So maybe the enolate forms at the less substituted position. Let me think: the ketone is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, so it's probably more hindered. So the base might abstract a proton from C6, which has a methyl group but is perhaps less hindered than C2.

Wait, but wait: the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents on the cyclohexane ring are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Wait, no: 2-ethyl would mean an ethyl group on C2, and 6-dimethyl would imply two methyl groups on C6? Or is it 2-ethyl
