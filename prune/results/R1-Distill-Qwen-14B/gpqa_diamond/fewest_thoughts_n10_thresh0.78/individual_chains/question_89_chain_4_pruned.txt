Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about some organic chemistry reactions and the resulting NMR spectra. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage-like molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in this structure.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and since it's heated with a dihalide, I think this is an elimination reaction. Oh right, dehydrohalogenation. So each Br will be removed, and since there are two adjacent Brs, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, but in dibromides, sometimes when you have adjacent Brs, elimination can form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. So when KOH is used, it abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diene or maybe a more substituted double bond structure?

Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination, but that wouldn't use excess KOH. So probably two eliminations. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh wait, when dibromides undergo double elimination, they can form either alkenes or cyclopropane rings? No, wait, that's when it's vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides (adjacent) upon double dehydrohalogenation form alkenes. So maybe the product is a substituted alkene.

But looking at the NMR data of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but the reaction was with KOH. Oh, wait no, elimination would form an alkene, but if the starting material is a dihalide and we do a double elimination, we get an alkene. But where does the carbonyl
