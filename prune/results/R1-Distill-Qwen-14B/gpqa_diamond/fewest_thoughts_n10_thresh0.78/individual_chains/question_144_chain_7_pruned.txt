Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, the question is about finding the mean decay distance. I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime and speed. 

The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I think the width relates to the lifetime somehow. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. 

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation. I think the natural line width is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ would be Planck's constant over Γ. But wait, Planck's constant is in J·s, and Γ is given in MeV. I'll need to convert units properly.

Once I have the lifetime, the next step is to find out how far the meson travels before decaying. That's the mean decay distance, which is velocity (v) multiplied by lifetime (τ). So distance L = v * τ. 

But wait, velocity v. How do I find that from the given energy and mass? I think I should use the relativistic energy formula. The energy E of a particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, γ would be 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is approximately 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667.

Now, velocity v in terms of γ is v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Wait, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). So β = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2) )² )) ? Let's compute that.

Wait, 8/1.2 is the same as 80/12, which simplifies to 20/3, approximately 6.6667. So (γ)² is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 1/γ² is 0.9775. Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, so v is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's see, 400/9 is 44.4444..., so 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root is... Let me think, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, yes. So v = 0.9887 c, where c is about 3e8 m/s.

Now, having velocity, I need the lifetime τ. Let me compute τ using τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure all the units are compatible. 

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.
