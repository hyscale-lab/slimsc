Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and IR spectroscopy. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. So, the aromatic ring has six carbons, and two substituents. Wait, but the total is 8, so each substituent must add a certain number of carbons. Let me think: the benzene ring is six carbons, and the substituents contribute 2 more, but wait, each substituent is probably a group attached. So, maybe each substituent is a single carbon group. Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons, and the other is none? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So each substituent adds some carbons.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has a carbonyl (C=O) group and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Oh wait, wait. Because the halogen is directly attached to the aromatic ring, so it's a substituted benzene with a halogen and another group that has a carbonyl.

Wait, but the total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6, so the two substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent must be one carbon each, or one substituent has two carbons and the other has none. But wait, no, the substituents can't be nothing because it's di-substituted. So each substituent must have one carbon, or one substituent has two and the other has one?

Wait, let's calculate. 6 (from benzene) + substituents = 8. Substituents total is 2 carbons. So two substituents, each adding one carbon. So each substituent is one carbon.

So, substituents are likely a halogen and a carbonyl group. But wait, the carbonyl is a functional group. Let me think. So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. But wait, carbonyl groups are O, so perhaps the substituent is something like a ketone, but that's not
