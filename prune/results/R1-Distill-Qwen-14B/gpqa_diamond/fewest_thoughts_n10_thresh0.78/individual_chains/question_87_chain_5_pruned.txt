Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm. It's about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. The ring itself is six-membered, so like benzene but with substituents. And the total carbon atoms are 8. Let me think. Benzene has 6 carbons; di-substituted would mean two substituents, each with their own carbons. So 6 + (substituent carbons) = 8. So the substituents must add up to 2 carbons in total. So each substituent can be a single carbon, like a methyl or something, but wait, that's 2 substituents each with a single carbon would be 2 carbons, so 6+2=8. But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent is probably a single carbon, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or something. Because in the FTIR, there's a carbonyl peak. So one substituent is a carbonyl group. Wait, no, the substituent could be a group that includes a carbonyl. So for example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group attached as a ketone, like a methyl ketone, but wait, that's more than one carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl group (CH3CO-), but then that's two carbons. Wait, but let me think about the number of carbons. The compound has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone group, which is a single carbon attached to the ring with
