Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When this acid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR spectra. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two productsâ€”major and minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3.

The key information here is about the NMR data of the products. The major product has a cross-peak in its NOESY spectrum, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding the starting materials. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. The dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid would form an anhydride where the two carbonyl groups are on the same side because the starting alkene was cis.

Wait, but wait. Dicarboxylic acids can form cyclic anhydrides when dehydrated. So if the original molecule is a cis-diacid, the resulting anhydride would have the two carbonyl groups connected in a way that reflects that cis configuration. Hmm. But I'm not sure about the exact structure yet.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which suggests perhaps an aromatic proton. But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, the product is an anhydride. Could this be a cyclic anhydride with an exo-methylene group, which might show up as a triplet around 5 or 6 ppm? Wait, no, the 7 ppm is higher. Maybe it's an aromatic ring. But wait, the starting material doesn't have a benzene ring. Unless, perhaps, the dehydration leads to a ring formation that includes an aromatic system. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a conjugated system that leads to some deshielded protons.

Wait, another thought: the single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR could be from an aromatic proton. But the anhydride doesn't have a benzene ring. Unless the starting acid had a benzene ring. Wait, the question didn't mention that, though. Hmm, maybe the 7 ppm is from something else.

Wait, another possibility: in the 13C NMR, the anhydride has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like a carbonyl group. Wait, 137 ppm is more like a carbonyl carbon. Or
