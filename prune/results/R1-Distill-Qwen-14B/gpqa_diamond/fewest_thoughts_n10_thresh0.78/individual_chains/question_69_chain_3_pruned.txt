Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ is decaying into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The problem asks what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe the decay, time dilation comes into play because the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the observed lifetime (τ) would be longer than the proper lifetime.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E/(m c²), but since energy E and mass m are given in the same units (GeV), and c² is in units that would cancel out, maybe I can calculate gamma as E/(m c²) but perhaps in natural units where c=1, so gamma is just E/m.

Wait, so E is the energy of the particle X⁰. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma should be 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.918. So gamma is about 7.92.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by tau0. Tau0 is 8e-16 seconds, so τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.92 *8 =63.36, so 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 7.92 *8e-16 is 63.36e-16 s. Because 8e-16 *7 is 56e-16, 0.92 *8e-16 is 7.36e-16, so total is 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 s.

Now, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I think this relates to the mean lifetime and the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in the lifetime translates into a certain uncertainty in the position, which is the resolution we're talking about here.

Wait, another approach: The number of decays observed depends on the detection time. The probability that a particle decays within a certain time is given by 1 - e^(-t/tau). But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think we're looking for the time such that the probability of decay is 30% (0.3), which would correspond to t where 1 - e^(-t/tau) = 0.3.

So solving for t: e^(-t/tau) = 0.7. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, -t/tau = ln(0.7) → t = -tau * ln(0.7).

Calculating ln(0.7): I remember that ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, so ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. So t = tau * 0.3567.

Wait, but tau is the mean lifetime. So t would be tau * (ln(2)) if it's the half-life, but here 0.3 corresponds to a shorter time.

Wait, but wait, what's the relation between the observed lifetime and the resolution? The resolution is the smallest time difference the detector can measure. So if the particle's lifetime is tau, to have a 30% chance of decay, the time t must be such that the particle has a 30% chance to decay in that time.

But perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the resolution relates to the speed of the particle and the time it takes to travel a certain distance.

Another approach: The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The average lifetime is tau, so the decay length L is v * tau. But since tau is the mean lifetime, the average distance is L = v * gamma * tau0.

Wait, because tau is gamma multiplied by tau0. So L = v * gamma tau0.

But gamma is E/(m), but wait, E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So v can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)) ) = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Wait, but since units are in GeV, perhaps I should calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)).

Given E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So m/E = 3.41 / 27 ≈ 0.1263.

So (m/E)^2 is about (0.1263)^2 ≈ 0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is about sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is approximately 0.992 c. So v ≈ 0.992 * c.

So the speed of the particle is approximately 0.992 times the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Now, the decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. Since the probability of decay in time t is P=1 - e^(-t/tau), where tau is the mean lifetime.

But we need the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the time t is such that the probability P is 30% or more.

Wait, but perhaps the resolution is about the distance corresponding to a certain time. Let me think: the minimum time resolution delta_t (the resolution) must allow us to measure the decay time accurately enough so that the number of decays detected is at least 30% of the possible.

Alternatively, considering that the average lifetime is tau, the maximum time you can miss a decay is on the order of tau. But perhaps the resolution must be such that the time uncertainty allows for capturing at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, maybe the 30% refers to the number of decays observed, which depends on the detector's ability to measure the decay accurately in time.

Wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is tau0
