Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what each part of the question is asking and how the reactions proceed.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I think I can draw that structure. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)-, no wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, no. Let me think again. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no. The structure for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2–, but wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as the substituent being attached to the cyclohexane. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propene chain. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2-C=CH2. Wait, no, because prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- with the substituent on the second carbon. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2–, but since it's a substituent, it's attached to the cyclohexane at the second carbon. So the structure is:

The cyclohexanone has a ketone at C1. Then, at C3, a CH2OH group. At C5, a group that's CH2-CH(CH2CH3), wait, perhaps another way. Alternatively, for prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2=C-CH2–, but attached at the second carbon. So maybe it's CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, propene has three carbons. The substituent is attached to C2 of the propene, so it's CH2-C(R)=CH2, but R here would be... Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=C(CH3)-, attached to the cyclohexane ring. So the group at C5 is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's probably not right. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C-CH2, but attached to the ring at the middle carbon. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the ring? No, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between
