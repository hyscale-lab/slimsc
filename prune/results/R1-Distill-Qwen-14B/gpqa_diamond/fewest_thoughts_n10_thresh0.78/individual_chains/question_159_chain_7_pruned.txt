Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about quasars and comoving distance. Hmm, let's see. The question says that observations of a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at around 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in cosmology, the peak wavelength of emission can tell us something about the object's redshift. Wait, but how?

Oh right, quasars emit light that gets stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted, that's redshift. The peak here is at 790 nm. I think the rest frame emission for quasars is often in the optical, like around 500 nm or so. Wait, wait, no, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line which is about 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But wait, quasars can have broad emission lines across the spectrum.

Wait, here's a thought. If the peak is at 790 nm, and it was emitted at a certain wavelength, the ratio would give me the redshift factor. Let's say the emitted wavelength is 位_emit, and the observed is 位_obs. The formula is (1 + z) = 位_obs / 位_emit.

But wait, what's the emitted wavelength here? Because the peak is in the near infrared, which is longer than optical. So if the quasar emits a peak in the optical, but we see it in the infrared, that would mean it's red
