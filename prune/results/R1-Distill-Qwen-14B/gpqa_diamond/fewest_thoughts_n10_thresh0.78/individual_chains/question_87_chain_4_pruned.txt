Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, that's interesting. A benzene ring is 6 carbons, right? So the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents attached to the ring. Each substituent can contribute to the total carbon count.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, that means the molecule has both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let me think about possible substituents. Common aromatic halogens include -Cl, -Br, -I, but they don't add any carbon atoms. The carbonyl group could be from an acyl substitution, like an acetyl group, which is -CO-R.

Wait, the substituents must account for the 8 total carbons. The benzene is 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons in total. Since each substituent is a group attached to the ring. Let me think: perhaps one substituent is a halogen (which is one atom, no carbons) and the other is a carbonyl group with one carbon. Because a carbonyl group like a
