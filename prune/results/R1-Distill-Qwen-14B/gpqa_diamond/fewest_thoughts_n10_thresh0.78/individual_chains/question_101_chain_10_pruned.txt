Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the suitable reagent (A) and catalyst (B) for the reaction.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw what's happening here. So 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The 3-methyl would mean there's a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring. 

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Breaking that down, the substituent on the pyrrolidine is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Wait, cyclohexylidene... that sounds like a cyclohexene group attached via a double bond. So, maybe that's a cyclohexyl group with a double bond, making it a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH2) to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, no, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group. So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring (six-membered, with a double bond) attached to the pyrrolidine via a CH2 group. But wait, the product is 1-substituted, so the substituent is on the first carbon of the pyrrolidine. 

So, the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, under acid catalysis, to form this product. What kind of reaction does that sound like? Acid catalyzed reactions with amines... hmm. One possibility is a ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Wait, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation? No, that's for aromatic rings. Or perhaps some kind of aldo reaction? Or
