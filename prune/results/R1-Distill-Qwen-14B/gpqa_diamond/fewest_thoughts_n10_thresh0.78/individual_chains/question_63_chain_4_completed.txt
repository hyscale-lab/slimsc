--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct one.

First, I should probably recall what the fundamental state means. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the molecule, which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. So, the molecule is in its lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state.

Wait, but the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm. So, what's the next state? I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can occur between vibrational and rotational states. But in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and each vibrational state can have multiple rotational states.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The non-rigid rotor model is a bit more complex than the rigid rotor because the bond length isn't fixed. Oh right, because in reality, molecules vibrate, so the bond length changes. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the bond length given is the average or something. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's a rigid rotor for simplicity.

But the question says "non-rigid rotor model," so maybe I should consider that the bond length can change. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy levels here. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, so that's probably going to be involved in calculating the energy change.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think that refers to the first vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). So, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

But the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher state. I'm a bit confused about whether it's a change in vibrational or rotational state. Because lower energy states are usually in the vibrational and rotational ground states.

Wait, the next lowest energy state after the fundamental state. Let's think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω, and the rotational energy levels are Er = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So, the total energy is Ev + Er.

The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next possible state that has the next higher energy. Since vibrational transitions usually have higher energy gaps, but if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, the next higher energy might come from a rotational transition.

Wait, but in rotational transitions, the change in energy is smaller than vibrational transitions. So, perhaps the next state after the fundamental would be a rotational state with J=1, keeping v=0.

Alternatively, maybe it's a vibrational transition to v=1 with J=0. I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So which transition gives a lower energy jump?

The energy difference for the first vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) is ΔE_v = ħω. The energy difference for the first rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is ΔE_r = ( (1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)) ) * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2) * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So which is smaller? It depends on the values of ω and I.

Wait, let me compute I, the moment of inertia. The formula for I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Given:

Mass of X, Mx = 20 amu
Mass of Y, My = 2 amu
Bond length, R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) in amu. Let's compute that.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) = 40 /22 = 1.818... amu.

Wait, but to compute I in kg·m², I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 = 1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg? Wait, 1.818 *1.6605 is roughly 1.8 * 1.66 is about 3. So approximately 3e-27 kg.

Wait, exact calculation:

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.818 * 1.6605 = approximately 1.818 *1.66 = 2.99958 → about 3. So 3e-27 kg.

Then, I = μ r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 12e-47 kg·m² = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Wait, no: 3e-27 *4e-20 is 12e-47, which is 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Wait, wait 3e-27 multiplied by 4e-20 is 12e-47 → yes.

Now, compute ΔE_r. ΔE_r = ħ²/(2I) → no, wait.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are Er = [J(J+1) ħ² ]/(2I). So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_r = [1*2 ħ²/(2I)] - [0] = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_r = ħ² / I.

Compute that. Let's compute ħ first. ħ is h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. h ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

I is 1.2e-46 kg·m².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = approx 9.266e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1.112e-68 divided by 1.2e-46 is (1.112 /1.2 ) * 1e-22 → 0.9267e-22 = 9.267e-23 J.

Now, the energy for the vibrational transition ΔE_v is ħ ω.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = approx 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, so ΔE_v is about 4.218e-20 J, and ΔE_r is about 9.267e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next lowest state would be J=1, v=0, because that requires less energy.

Wait, but wait. The next state with the lowest possible energy could also involve a change in both vibrational and rotational states. But I think the lowest energy transition is the one with the smallest ΔE, so the rotational transition would have a lower ΔE than the vibrational.

So the photon must supply the energy equal to ΔE_r, which is 9.267e-23 J.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the momentum p of the photon. Hmm. Because the energy of the photon is E = pc, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

Wait, yes. For a photon, E = pc, so p = E/c.

So the energy of the photon must be equal to the energy difference between the states, which in this case is ΔE_r = 9.267e-23 J.

So p = E/c = (9.267e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are anywhere near that. Wait, looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, Ns is kg·m/s, so these are momentum values. So my calculation gives about 3.089e-31 kg·m/s = 3.089e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are this low. All options are around 1e-27 or 1e-28. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) → Mx=20, My=2.

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.00e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.81818 *1.6605 = let me compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605: 

1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈ 0.0302.

So sum is about 2.9889 + 0.0302 ≈ 3.0191 → so 3.0191e-27 kg.

So I = μ * R² → R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

I = 3.0191e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 12.076e-47 kg m² → 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Wait, so I is 1.2076e-46 kg m².

ΔE_r = ħ² / I.

Compute ħ²: (1.05457e-34 J s)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² /I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approx 9.206e-23 J.

Wait, that's the same as before. So E_photon = 9.206e-23 J.

Then p = E/c = 9.206e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.068e-31 kg m/s → 3.068e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near 1e-31. Hmm. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption about the transition.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but with J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Which requires less energy?

Earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires 9.2e-23 J and the vibrational requires 4.2e-20 J. So rotational is lower. So the photon would have to supply 9.2e-23 J.

But that leads to a p of about 3e-31 Ns, but none of the options are that low. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I have confused the rigid rotor model with the non-rigid. Oh, in the non-rigid model, the bond length isn't fixed, which affects the moment of inertia. But since the question gives a bond length, perhaps we can ignore the non-rigid part for the purposes of this calculation and treat it as a rigid rotor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes. Wait, but the question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest possible energy increase would be the smallest ΔE. So the rotational transition is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination where both v and J change. But that's more complicated. I think the question is expecting a single transition, probably a pure rotational or pure vibrational.

Wait, but the options are all much higher than what I calculated. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, double-checking the calculation of μ. Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) = 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

Ah, wait, amu is atomic mass units, which is the mass of a carbon-12 atom divided by 12. So each amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg.

So 1.81818 amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = Let's compute 1.8 *1.6605 = 2.9889, 0.01818 *1.6605 = 0.0302.

Total is about 2.9889 + 0.0302 = 3.0191 → 3.0191e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.0191e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0191e-27 *4e-20 = 12.0764e-47 → 1.20764e-46 kg·m².

So that seems correct.

ΔE_r = (ħ²)/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.20764e-46) → let's compute it.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.20764e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.20764e-46 ≈ 9.206e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.206e-23 J.

Wait, but 9.2e-23 J is 9.2e-23 J. What's the momentum?

p = E/c = 9.206e-23 J / 3e8 m/s → 3.068e-31 kg·m/s → 3.068e-31 Ns.

But the options are all in the 1e-28 to 1e-27 range. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for ΔE_r. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by Er = [J(J+1) ħ² ]/(2I).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

ΔE_r = Er(1) - Er(0) = [2 ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no: [1*(1+1) ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to a vibrational state, specifically the first overtone or something else. But that would require higher energy. Wait, but if the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0, the next state with the lowest possible energy could be v=1, J=0. But that's a higher energy change than the rotational transition.

So why am I getting such a small p?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for the bond length. Let me recheck. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is modeling the molecule as a rigid rotor with a certain moment of inertia, but maybe I should have considered it as a diatomic with the bond length R, but perhaps the reduced mass is calculated differently. Wait, no, the reduced mass is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is due to the vibrational transition. But that would require a higher E and p than the rotational case.

Wait, maybe I should compute the vibrational photon's momentum and see.

ΔE_v = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's about 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps transitions can be either rotational or vibrational, but in this case, the next state with the lowest energy is the vibrational transition. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining which transition is lower in energy. Let me compare the energies again.

ΔE_r (rotational) is about 9.2e-23 J.

ΔE_v (vibrational) is about 4.2e-20 J.

So ΔE_v is much larger. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the next state. But my calculation gives p=3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. In molecular spectroscopy, the fundamental vibrational transition is from v=0 to v=1. But perhaps the question is considering the fundamental state as the ground state of rotation and vibration together. So the next state could be either a rotational or vibrational state, but the one with the lower energy is the rotational transition.

But again, that gives a p of 3e-31, which isn't among the options.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think about other possibilities.

Ah! Wait a minute, another approach. The question is about absorbing a photon to switch to the next state. The next state with the lowest energy is the one that requires the smallest possible photon energy, which is the rotational transition. So the photon's energy is ΔE_r = ħ²/(2I) → wait, no, I think earlier I had it right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the vibrational ground state (v=0) with J=0 to v=0 and J=1. Which is the rotational transition.

But perhaps I messed up the formula for the energy of the photon. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would make sense because the options are in that range.

Wait, if the photon causes a vibrational transition, the energy is ħ ω. So p = ħ ω / c.

Let me compute that.

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

ω =4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg·m/s → 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns. So that's a match.

But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy, but that gives a p of 3e-31, which is option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 4.6e2 times larger.

So why did I think the rotational transition requires less energy? Because I computed ΔE_r as 9.2e-23 J, which is less than ΔE_v of 4.2e-20 J.

Wait, that's correct. So why would the problem involve a photon causing a vibrational transition when a rotational transition is possible with less energy?

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.

The question states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. What is the next state with the lowest possible energy?

The fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next state in the energy ordering. So perhaps the next state after (v=0, J=0) is (v=0, J=1), which requires less energy than (v=1, J=0).

So the photon should provide energy for the rotational transition, which is ΔE_r = 9.2e-23 J, leading to p = 3.068e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_r.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 1/2 in the formula for the rotational energy levels.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are Er = [J(J+1) ħ² ]/(2I). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

ΔE_r = [ (1*2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) )= 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the rigid rotor model, but I used the non-rigid. Hmm, but I used the given bond length R, which should be okay.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

μ is (20*2)/(22)=40/22=1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 *1.66e-27 = approx 3e-27 kg.

I=μ R²=3e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² =12e-47 kg m²=1.2e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

So ΔE_r = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.2e-46 = (1.112e-68) / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.266e-23 J.

So E_photon=9.266e-23 J → p= 9.266e-23 /3e8 = approx 3.089e-31 Ns.

Which is 3.09e-31 Ns. But the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is mistakenly referring to the vibrational transition, but that would be a much larger energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition from J=0 to J=1 and v=0 to v=1, but that's a combination band and usually requires more energy, but maybe the problem is considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but only the vibrational. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the next state is a vibrational transition, not a rotational one.

Wait, perhaps the question is in the context of electronic transitions, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the term 'fundamental state' to refer to the first vibrational state (v=1) with J=0. But I thought the fundamental state was v=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the 'fundamental vibrational state' as v=0, and the next state is v=1.

So perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the vibrational transition. Let me compute the photon's momentum for that.

E_photon = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c= 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 Ns.

That's about 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why would the rotational transition require a lower energy and not be considered?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only vibrational transitions and not rotational. But that wouldn't make sense because rotation-vibration models include both.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model affects the moment of inertia in a way that I'm not considering. But the problem gives the bond length R as 2 angstroms, so I think I can use that for the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the moment of inertia. Let me recompute I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ =1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.0199e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.0199e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0199e-27 *4e-20 = 12.0796e-47 kg m² → 1.20796e-46 kg m².

So, ħ squared is (1.0545e-34)^2= 1.112e-68 J² s².

So, ΔE_r = ħ² / I → 1.112e-68 / 1.20796e-46 ≈ 9.205e-23 J.

p = 9.205e-23 /3e8 = 3.068e-31 kg m/s → 3.068e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition's momentum.

But why would the question not consider the lower energy rotational transition?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule can't undergo a pure rotational transition because of selection rules. Oh, right! In rotational spectroscopy, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. But for the transition to occur, the molecule must have a permanent dipole moment. But the problem doesn't mention anything about that. So perhaps the problem assumes that the transition is allowed.

But why would the problem's answer be based on a vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the options are based on the vibrational transition. Because option D is 1.4e-28, which matches the E_photon for the vibrational transition.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D.

But then why did the calculation for the rotational transition not match any option? Maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the moment of inertia.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, but treating the moment of inertia differently. Wait, no, the calculation I did is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses R in a different unit. Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is actually referring to a vibrational transition, not a rotational one, because the photon's energy is given by the vibrational frequency. But why would the fundamental state's next state be a vibrational transition when a rotational one is possible with less energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is v=1, J=0. But that requires a higher energy, so why would it be the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the rotational transition is lower, but perhaps the problem is considering only vibrational transitions.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me see the options again.

Option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches the vibrational transition's p.

So perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the vibrational transition, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy. So I think I might have to go with option D.

But why would the question be set up that way?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in its fundamental vibrational state (v=0) and the next state is v=1. That would require a photon with E= ħ ω.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and not including vibrational transitions, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm miscalculating the energy for the rotational transition. Let me recheck the formula.

The rotational energy levels are Er = [J(J+1)ħ²]/(2I).

So ΔE_r = Er(1) - Er(0) = [2 ħ²/(2I)] - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the moment of inertia as I = μ R², which I've done.

So, I think my calculation is correct. But the answer doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. Planck's constant is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is about 1.05457e-34 J·s. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of the moment of inertia.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.81818 amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

μ = 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 = let's calculate.

1.81818 * 1.66053906660 = 1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.019 kg·amu?

Wait, no, it's 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.019e-27 kg.

So I = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 12.076e-47 → 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So, ΔE_r = (1.05457e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46 → 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = 9.205e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.205e-23 J, leading to p=3.068e-31 Ns. But the options don't have anything close.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a transition that involves both a change in J and v. But that would require more energy, and the problem states the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the 'next state' is the first state higher than the fundamental, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. But in that case, the rotational transition is lower, so why isn't that the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's vibrational energy as the primary factor, and the rotational as a secondary consideration. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the energy of the photon as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. But that would be a higher energy, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1 with v=1 as well. But that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total energy difference. For example, if the transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition, and the energy is ΔE_r =9.2e-23 J, but that leads to a p that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational transition, which gives p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

In that case, the correct answer would be D.

But I'm confused why the rotational transition isn't considered. Maybe the problem is looking for the vibrational transition's momentum, despite the rotational being lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE_r. Let me compute it again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rotational energy as Er = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

The rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I c), where c is the speed of light. But wait, that would be in cm⁻¹ if we're considering wavenumbers.

But perhaps the photon's energy is given by the rotational transition, which is 2B in wavenumbers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be equal to the rotational constant times some factor.

But I think I'm getting off track. Let me try to think differently.

Given that the options don't match the rotational transition's p, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition's p, which is option D.

So, after all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem as follows:

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, which is the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the ground rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy could involve either a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) or a vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1). The energy required for these transitions is compared to determine which one corresponds to the next state.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The moment of inertia for the diatomic molecule is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2
   \]
   where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass and \( R \) is the bond length.  
   - Given \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \) and \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \), the reduced mass is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
   - Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Thus:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]

2. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (ΔE_r):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_r = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the transition \( J=0 \to J=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_r = E_r(1) - E_r(0) = \frac{2\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( I = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_r = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.205 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition (ΔE_v):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega.
   \]
   The energy difference for the transition \( v=0 \to v=1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_v = E_v(1) - E_v(0) = \hbar\omega.
   \]
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_v = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Photon Momentum (p):**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c},
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

   - For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_r = \frac{\Delta E_r}{c} = \frac{9.205 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.068 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p_v = \frac{\Delta E_v}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy (\( \Delta E_r \)) than the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_v \)). However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( p_r \)) does not match any of the provided options. The vibrational transition's momentum (\( p_v \)) matches option **D** (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), suggesting that the problem is expecting the vibrational transition to be considered.
