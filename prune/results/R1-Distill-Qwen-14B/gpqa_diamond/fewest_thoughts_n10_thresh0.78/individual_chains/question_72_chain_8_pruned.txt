Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about.

The question is a synthesis problem, and it's asking about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7. Hmm, okay, I need to go through each step and see what's happening.

So, first, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo structures are norbornene derivatives. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So, the structure is a norbornene ring with an O-t-Bu group.

The first reaction is combining this with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Okay, so I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting material is a diene (since the bicyclo structure has two double bonds, but wait, wait. Wait, the substituent is at position 7, but the bicyclo has two double bonds? Let me think. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has double bonds at 2 and 5 positions. So it's a conjugated diene, right? So it can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That's a dienophile, I think. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is another conjugated diene, but when it's used as a dienophile, perhaps it's reacting in a way where each end can react. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is adding two equivalents, so maybe each end is a dienophile.

Wait, but the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexene ring with two substituents: each at positions 5 and 6 is a dibromomethyl group. So each substituent is CH2Br2? No, wait, dibromomethyl would be Br2C-... Wait, no, dibromomethyl is probably CH2Br2, but wait, CH2Br2 is actually not possible because you can't have two Brs on a CH2. Wait, maybe it's CH2Br2 as in each CH2 has two Brs? Hmm, but that would be a quaternary carbon, but that's not possible for CH2. So perhaps it's more like (Br)2CH- group? No, wait, the substituent is dibromomethyl, which is -CH2Br2? Or maybe it's a geminal dihalide, like -CBr2-.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the substituent is dibromomethyl, which would be -CH2Br2. But wait, that's impossible because a
