Alright, let me try to figure this out. Okay, so I have a density matrix here, and I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states and pure states. This one looks like it's a combination of |0> and |1> states, each multiplied by 1/2. Oh right, because when you add |0><0| and |1><1|, each is a projector, and multiplying each by 1/2 makes them sum up to a trace of 1, which is required for density matrices.

So what's the geometrical position? I think qubits are represented in a Bloch sphere, right? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, and on the Bloch sphere, it's a point on the surface. But this ρ is a mixed state because it's a probabilistic mixture of |0> and |1>, each with probability 1/2. So it's a classical mixture, not entangled or anything.

In the Bloch representation, a mixed state is represented by a point inside the sphere, not on the surface. The position is determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices, I think. The general form for a density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in that form, then r would be the coordinates.

Let's see. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out |0> and |1> in terms of the Bloch sphere. Oh wait, |0> is (1, 0, 0) when represented as a point on the Bloch sphere, and |1> is (−1, 0, 0), but wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. The Bloch sphere's coordinates are (x, y, z), where for |0> it's (1,0,0), and for |1> it's (−1,0,0), or is it the other way around? Wait, I think |0> is (1,0,0), and |1> is (−1,0,0). Or maybe I'm getting that reversed. Wait, no, wait, the z-axis usually represents the spin-up and spin-down. So for a spin-1/2 particle, |↑⟩ is (1,0,0) in x? Wait no, wait, perhaps I should think of |0> as the state pointing along the +z direction, which is (1,0,0) in Bloch coordinates.

Wait, maybe I should write the general form. The density matrix for a mixed state can be written as (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2, where r_x, r_y, r_z are components of the vector r, and the vector's magnitude is sqrt(rx^2 + ry^2 + rz^2), which must be <=1 for the state to be valid (since the state is inside or on the Bloch sphere).

So, our given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1|:

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and 0 elsewhere.

Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the (2,2) position.

Adding them together, we get a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, when multiplied by 1/2, each diagonal entry becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal are zeros. So the density matrix ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Alternatively, ρ can be written as (I + 0·σ_x + 0·σ_y + 0·σ_z)/2. Because I is the identity matrix, which is (σ_x + σ_y + σ_z + I)/2 when considering, wait, no, wait. The identity matrix is (I) and the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So in this case, if ρ is (I)/2, that would imply that all the coefficients for σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are zero. Because I/2 is the same as (I + 0 + 0 + 0)/2.

So that would mean the vector r is (0,0,0). Because rx=0, ry=0, rz=0.

Wait, but let me think again. The density matrix ρ is (I + r · σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So if ρ is (I)/2, then (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r is (0,0,0). Therefore, the point in the Bloch sphere would be at the origin. 

So the position is at (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0).

Wait, but what exactly is being asked? The question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh, perhaps the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), meaning the density matrix is the completely mixed state. That makes sense because the state is a 50-50 mixture of |0> and |1>, so it's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state would have zero Bloch vector, hence position at the origin.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The density matrix provided is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). In the Bloch sphere representation, a mixed state is represented as a point inside the sphere, determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form of a density matrix in this representation is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \(\rho\), it can be written as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (\(r_x, r_y, r_z\)) are all zero. This means the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which is consistent with the given density matrix being an equal mixture of \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position in the qubit space is:

**r = (0, 0, 0)**.
