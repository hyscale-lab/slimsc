Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was proceeding. There were two new spots, so two products formed. The question is asking which of the options could be the structures of these products.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure.

The main structure is a benzene ring with an ether linkage. The oxygen is connected to a butenyl group. Let's see: but-3-en-1-yl. So that's a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but wait, no, wait. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's not possible because butenyl is four carbons. Wait, perhaps I should recount.

But-3-en-1-yl: the numbering starts from the oxygen. So the structure is CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2, so dimethyl. So the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

Let's build this. The group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bond from C3 to C4. Wait, but but is four carbons, so 1-yl would be the first carbon attached to oxygen. So the structure would be:

O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, that can't be right because the double bond is at position 3. So maybe
