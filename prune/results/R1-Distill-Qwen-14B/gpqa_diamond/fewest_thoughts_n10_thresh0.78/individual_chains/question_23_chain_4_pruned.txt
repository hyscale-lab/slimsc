Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and the products formed. 

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to draw its structure. So, the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The other part of the ether is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C3 and C4, right? So the structure would be:

The butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no, but is four carbons. Let me think: the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but but only has four carbons. So numbering starts from the end where the chain is attached. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en is CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, no. Wait, but-3-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-, but wait no, because the butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl, so the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, that can't be because but-3-enyl would start counting from the attachment point. So, perhaps it's OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait, the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituents are on the second carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure would be O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Or is the butenyl group O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C
