Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because enthalpy of neutralization can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. I remember that it's usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but that might be an average value. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with specific amounts, so I think I need to calculate the exact amount of H+ and OH- ions involved.

First, I'll figure out the moles of each acid and base.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. Since it's a diprotic acid, but I'm not sure if both H+ ions are available. Wait, in dilute solutions, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is only partial. Hmm, but in neutralization, does H2SO4 donate both H+ ions? Maybe in this case, since it's being neutralized by a base, both H+ would react. Or maybe only the first H+? No, wait, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but let's think about the neutralization reaction. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

So we have three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So the total H+ from all the acids and the OH- from the base will combine.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, when you mix an acid and a base, H+ from acids reacts with OH- from bases to form water. So the total H+ from all acids will react with the total OH- from the bases.

But wait, in this case, how many moles of H+ do we have from each acid?

Let me calculate each separately.

Starting with HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. H2SO4 is diprotic, but in solution, the first H+ is completely dissociated, and the second is only partially. But wait, when it's reacting with a strong base, perhaps both H+ are available for neutralization. Let me think. Since the base has a lot of OH-, maybe both H+ from H2SO4 will react.

But wait, another approach: when H2SO4 is a strong acid, but I think only the first H+ is strong. The second is a weak acid. So in neutralization, perhaps only the first H+ (the strong one) will react. Or wait, no, because the neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH- regardless of their source. So if H2SO4 donates 2 H+ per molecule, but only the first one is fully dissociated, but in neutralization, the base has enough OH- to take both H+.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. For H2SO4, in a solution, the first H+ (H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-?) No, that's not right. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait no. Wait, in water, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2- ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first H+ but the second is a weak acid. Wait, wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (which is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate further much). So each mole of H2SO4 gives one mole of H+ in the first dissociation. The second H+ comes from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which doesn't go to completion. So, in a solution, the concentration of H+ is higher, but for the purpose of neutralization, perhaps we can consider that each H2SO4 provides two H+ ions. Or wait, perhaps we should only consider the first H+ for the neutralization.

Wait, but in the neutralization reaction, you can have both H+ from H2SO4 reacting. Let me think: when Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it will provide a lot of OH- ions. So the H+ from both acids (HCl and H2SO4) will react with the OH-.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in reality, the second H+ isn't as strong. So when you mix H2SO4 with a strong base, perhaps only one H+ per H2SO4 reacts. Or maybe both do. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat H2SO4 as providing two H+ ions per molecule. Let me proceed with that assumption because I think that's a common approach in such problems.

So, for H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. If each provides 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Wait, but wait: HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+ as I calculated earlier.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ from acids is HCl (0.1) + H2SO4 (0.09 × 2 = 0.18) → 0.28 moles of H+.

Total OH- from base is 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So the limiting reagent here will determine how much reacts.

Let's compare the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.28 moles.

OH- total: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react, leaving some H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2 moles.

So the total moles of H+ and OH- reacting is 0.2 moles each, making 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think about the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

H+ total: 0.28.

OH- total: 0.2.

So OH- is less, so all OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

But wait, for the neutralization, the heat is released based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. So the heat is calculated based on the moles of H+ that actually react with OH-.

Wait, but wait, no. The enthalpy of neutralization depends on the amount of H+ and OH- reacting. Since the enthalpy per mole is constant, the total heat released would be moles of H+ reacted × enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but in neutralization, each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases a certain amount of energy, typically about 57 kJ per mole for strong acids and bases. But perhaps in this problem, we should calculate using that value.

Wait, but let me get back to the calculations.

So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 moles. So the heat released would be 0.2 × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the question is about the enthalpy, which is in kcal or kJ. The options are a mix of kcal and kJ, so I need to check the units.

Wait, options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Hmm. So the answer might be in kJ or kcal. Since 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

Let me calculate the heat in kJ first.

0.2 moles × 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. So the change is exothermic, so negative. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the limiting reagent is H+ and not OH-.

Wait, earlier calculation said H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is limiting. So only 0.2 moles of H+ react. So the total H+ reacting is 0.2, producing 0.2 moles of water, releasing 0.2 × 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have 11.4 kJ as an option. Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. So perhaps I need to convert this energy into kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is equal to how many kcal? Since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 57 × 0.239 ≈ 13.703 kcal.

So 0.2 moles × 13.703 kcal/mol ≈ 2.74 kcal. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ = 57 × 0.239 ≈ 13.703 kcal.

So 0.2 × 13.703 ≈ 2.74 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Close, but why a slight difference?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact value of enthalpy per mole.

Alternatively, perhaps the given enthalpy is per mole of H+ reacting. Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ/mol for H+.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → if each gives 2 H+, then 0.18 moles H+.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is diprotic. The first H+ is fully dissociated, the second is not. So in a dilute solution, perhaps only the first H+ is considered. So for the purposes of neutralization, H2SO4 contributes one H+ per mole. Or does it contribute two?

Wait, maybe I should only consider the first H+ for H2SO4. Let me think: For H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, so each mole gives 1 H+ (the second H+ is from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely unless in very strong conditions. But in this case, since it's reacting with a strong base, which is in excess of OH-, perhaps both H+ ions from H2SO4 are available for reaction.

Wait, but in reality, sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first dissociation, but the second is weak. So in a solution like this, the second H+ isn't completely dissociated. So maybe each H2SO4 contributes only one H+.

Hmm, this is a point where I might be getting stuck. Let me think. If H2SO4 is 0.3 M and 0.3 L, that's 0.09 moles. If each contributes one H+ (from the first dissociation), that's 0.09 moles of H+. So HCl gives 0.1, H2SO4 gives 0.09 × 1 = 0.09, total H+ is 0.19.

Wait, then the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles. So H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is in excess. H+ is limiting. So 0.19 moles of H+ will react with 0.19 moles of OH-.

So the heat released is 0.19 × 57 kJ/mol = 10.83 kJ ≈ 10.8 kJ, which is about 2.536 kcal (since 10.8 × 0.239 ≈ 2.537 kcal). But none of the options are exactly that. Option A is -2.72 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is considering only the strong acid's H+.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so all its H+ (0.1 moles) will dissociate.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in this case, maybe only the first H+ is considered, so 0.09 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.19 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles. So H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2.

So H+ is limiting, so 0.19 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.19 moles of water.

The heat released is 0.19 × 57 kJ/mol = 10.83 kJ, which is approximately 2.536 kcal.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.5 kJ (since 11.42 ×4.184≈47.7 kJ). Hmm, but that would be if I have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting (0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ).

Wait, maybe I should consider that H2SO4 contributes two H+.

So let me recalculate.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, each contributing 2 H+ → 0.18 moles H+.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles. So H+ reacts is 0.2 moles.

So heat is 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. Convert to kcal: 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.724 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I considered H2SO4 providing only one H+, I was getting ≈2.536 kcal, which is close to option C (-3.80 kcal?), no, no. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is providing two OH- per mole, but let me recheck the moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles of OH-.

Yes, that's correct.

So, if H2SO4 contributes two H+ per mole, then the H+ is 0.28 total, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is limiting, so 0.2 H+ reacts. So 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So why is option B there with -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is using a different enthalpy value per mole of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the molarity of the solutions and not considering that H2SO4 contributes two H+.

Hmm, but the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and find the limiting reagent.

Wait, let me try it again.

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each provides 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 mol H+ reacts, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 × 57 kJ =11.4 kJ → 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal).

So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 11.42 ×4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. That would imply 0.837 moles of H+ reacting. But that's more than the OH- available.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reaction in a different way. Maybe considering the neutralization of each acid separately.

Another approach: perhaps the H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in this case, since it's being neutralized by a base that's also polyvalent, perhaps the stoichiometry is different.

Wait, the reaction would be between H+ from HCl and H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

The neutralization reaction can be written as:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, regardless of the source, each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So, in our case, the total H+ is 0.28, the total OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 moles of H+ will react, releasing 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ.

But 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, the problem is in the initial assumption. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is about 57 kJ per mole of H+ reacted. But in reality, for polyprotic acids, the second H+ might have a lower enthalpy.

But in this problem, perhaps we are to assume that each mole of H+ contributes 57 kJ.

So the correct calculation would be 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ = ~2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions involved.

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺}.
   \]

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid, and for the purpose of this problem, both H⁺ ions are assumed to be available for neutralization.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles of H₂SO₄}.
   \]  
   Since each mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 moles of H⁺:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄} = 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Total moles of H⁺ from acids**:  
   \[
   \text{Total H⁺} = 0.1 \, (\text{from HCl}) + 0.18 \, (\text{from H₂SO₄}) = 0.28 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

4. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, providing 2 moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

5. **Limiting reagent**:  
   The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since there are 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.2 moles of OH⁻, OH⁻ is the limiting reagent. Thus, 0.2 moles of H⁺ will react with 0.2 moles of OH⁻ to form water.

6. **Enthalpy of neutralization**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately **57 kJ per mole of H⁺ reacted**.  
   \[
   \text{Heat released} = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times 57 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kcal (1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal):  
   \[
   11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = 2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]  
   Since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative:  
   \[
   \Delta H = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

7. **Matching the options**:  
   The closest match to the calculated value is **-2.72 kcal**, which corresponds to **option A**.

Answer: A
