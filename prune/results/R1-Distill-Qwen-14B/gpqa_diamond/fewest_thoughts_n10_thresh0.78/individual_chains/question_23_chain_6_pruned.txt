Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots. I need to choose which products could have formed from the options A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the mechanisms, but let's think. The starting material is an ether. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a benzene ring. So the butenyl group is connected via an oxygen to the benzene. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 of the butenyl group, I think. Wait, the formula is 3-en-1-yl. So the butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Or wait no, wait. Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that.

Butenyl group: positions 1,2,3,4. The substituents are on carbon 2 and 2 (so two methyl groups), and the double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-? Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4, which is actually between the third and fourth carbon. Wait, but for butenyl, the positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents.

Wait, the substituents are on carbon 2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, but the substituents are on the
