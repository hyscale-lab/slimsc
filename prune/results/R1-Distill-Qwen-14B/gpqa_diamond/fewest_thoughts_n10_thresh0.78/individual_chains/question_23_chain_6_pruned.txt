Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. The researcher checked with TLC and saw two new spots. So, the reactant is probably undergoing some kind of reaction, maybe addition or substitution.

Wait, the structure given is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Let me draw that. The benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached to another chain. The chain is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4, I think. Wait, butenyl would have the double bond at position 3? Let me count: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C3? No, wait. But-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached from the first carbon. Wait no, correct numbering. So, for but-3-en-1-yl, the four carbons are 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that's impossible because but has only four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-benzene? No, wait that would be but-1-en-3-yl or something. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me structure it again.

Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the main chain is butenyl, with substituents at C2 and C2 (so two methyl groups). The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is: O-benzene connected to a -CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, the substituents are on C2. Let me think.

Alternatively, the structure is O-benzene connected to CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's O-benzene attached to CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but arranged as CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O
