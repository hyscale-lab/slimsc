Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about an oscillating charge distribution. Hmm, the setup is that the charge is spheroidal and oscillating, so it radiates. The question is about the maximum power radiated and the fraction of that power radiated at a specific angle, 30 degrees. Plus, I need to figure out the form of the function f, which depends on lambda and theta.

Wait, I remember something about antenna radiation patterns and how the power is distributed in different directions. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis, and the power radiated varies with the angle. I think the maximum power is along the equator, perpendicular to the dipole's axis. But wait, no, wait. A dipole's radiation is maximum at 90 degrees from the axis. So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is in the plane perpendicular to z, which would be at theta=90 degrees.

But this problem is about an oscillating charge that's spheroidal. Wait, a spheroid is like a sphere that's been stretched or compressed along an axis. So the charge distribution is symmetric around the z-axis. So maybe it's acting like a dipole but with some specific radiation characteristics.

The question is about the maximum power, which is A, and the fraction at theta=30 degrees. So I need to find what fraction of A is radiated at theta=30.

Hmm, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole might be something like sin(theta), so the power would be proportional to sin^2(theta), but I'm not sure. Wait, the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (1/(lambda^2 r^2)) * sin^2(theta), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact form.

Wait, but thinking about the radiation in terms of the dipole approximation, the electric field is given by something like E = (d^2)/(r^2) * (1/(4pi epsilon_0)) * (something with sin(theta) and such). But when you square that for the power (which is related to the Poynting vector), you might get a sin^2(theta) dependency.

So the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin^
