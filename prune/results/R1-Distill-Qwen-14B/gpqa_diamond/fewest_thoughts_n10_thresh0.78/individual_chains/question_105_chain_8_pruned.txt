Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that when only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric observations show brightness variations due to rotation. But this setup can look like an exoplanet's signal. The question is: what exoplanet radius relative to the star would produce the same brightness variation amplitude if the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, so the star's brightness variation is being mistaken for an exoplanet's transit. So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the dip caused by the planet blocking the star is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

First, I think I need to calculate the brightness change caused by the spots and then set that equal to the dip caused by a planet transit.

When a planet transits in front of a star, the observed brightness drops by an amount proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. So the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2. That's the transit method for detecting exoplanets.

On the star with spots, the situation is different. The star's brightness isn't uniform. One hemisphere has spots. So as the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view. The total brightness observed will vary because when spots are facing us, they contribute less light, so the observed brightness dips.

But wait, the star's overall brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the total emitted light is less.

The problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

But wait, a hemisphere is half the star. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) ? Or wait
