Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different substances with excess bromine. Each substance has a benzene ring with a substituent, and we're supposed to determine the order of their para-isomer yields based on weight fraction, from least to most. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, right, electrophilic substitution on benzene rings. So, the substituents attached to the ring are either activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive towards electrophiles, while deactivating groups make it less reactive. Also, substituents can be ortho/para directors or meta directors. 

Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer's yield. So, the directing effect of the substituent will influence where the bromine adds. For example, if the substituent is a strong activating group like -NH2, it would direct incoming electrophiles to the para position. But if it's a deactivating group, like -NO2, it might be a meta director.

But wait, the problem says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, but wait, no, because for some substituents, you can have multiple positions. However, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, we need to rank the para yields from least to most.

Wait, actually, the question is which substituent leads to the lowest percentage of para product. Because the problem is the 'order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer'â€”so we're looking for which substituent gives the least para, then next, etc.

Wait no, the question says arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the first substance in the order has the least para yield, next has more, and so on up to the most. So, the correct order is from least to most para.

So, the plan is: for each substituent, determine whether it's an activating or deactivating group, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing. Then, the para yield would depend on that.

Let me look at each substituent one by one.
