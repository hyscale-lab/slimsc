Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about NMR and organic compounds. The question is about identifying an unknown compound among four options: two propenyl and two butenyl acetates, with cis and trans isomers each.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us about the number of protons. The singlet at 2.1 ppm with 3H probably means a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split its signal, maybe an ester like acetate. Because acetate esters have a methyl group attached to an oxygen, which is typically a singlet.

Looking at the doublets and doublets of quadruplets. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16 Hz. A coupling that big, 16 Hz, suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Because for trans alkenes, vicinal protons couple with larger J values, around 12-18 Hz, I think. So maybe this is a vinyl proton?

Wait, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm. That's a bit more complex. Maybe it's a proton adjacent to a double bond, so perhaps a vinyl group or part of a conjugated system.

The 1.6 ppm is a triplet of 3H as a doublet. Wait, no, it's 3H, d. So that's a methyl group attached to something. Maybe a CH2 group attached to a double bond. Because CH2 groups next to double bonds can split into doublets if they're next to another CH2 or CH.

So, let's think about the structures of the options. The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

Let me draw their structures. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait no, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-CH3. So the ester is R-O-CO-CH3. So the R group is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So the structures are of the form R-O-CO-CH3, where R is either propenyl or butenyl, and the double bond is either cis or trans.

The propenyl group is CH2CHCH2? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent, but in the ester, it's O-CH2-CH=CH2 for propenyl acetate? Or is it O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Propenyl groups can be allyl groups. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but propen
