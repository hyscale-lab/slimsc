Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to find out what X is from the options A to D.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Isn't that a type of amine? Or maybe a base? Oh right, it's a bicyclic amine. I remember that this compound is often used in certain reactions, maybe like an acid-base reactions or some kind of ring-opening. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh! I think it's used in the formation of epoxides. Or wait, maybe it's a catalyst for something else. Alternatively, could it be used in deprotonation reactions?

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DBU. DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So, in such a reaction, maybe compound X is undergoing some kind of elimination or ring-opening. Alternatively, if X is an epoxide, perhaps DBU is used for ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product has a certain structure, and we're to determine the starting material, X. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the reaction is opening it? Or maybe X is a diene or something else.

Let me look at the NMR data for the product.

The 1H NMR has signals at:
- δ2.28 (3H, s)
- δ2.31 (3H, s)
- δ6.75 (1H, d)
- δ7.08 (2H, d)
- δ7.68 (1H, d)
- δ7.71 (2H, d)

So looking at the 1H NMR, there are two singlets integrating to 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups. One is at 2.28 and the other at 2.31. They are close to each other, so maybe they're adjacent or in a similar environment.

The aromatic region has several signals. The d (doublet) indicates coupling with one neighboring proton. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, but the coupling in doublets might suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring or some coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic signals are part of a styrene group or something similar. Let's think about how the substituents would arrange.

The 13C NMR has data:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
