Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two particles of each A⁺ and A⁻. The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each a different multiple of the speed of light.

Wait, I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can treat it as if it's at rest? Or is there another approach?

Wait, no. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, right, that's probably implying that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate that the antiproton is at rest for the initial calculation. But wait, the proton is moving towards it. Or does the fact that the antiproton is moving slowly mean that the system is approximately at rest? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The initial setup: the proton and antiproton are colliding. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate the initial momentum as mainly from the proton. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or the antiproton; it just says the antiproton is moving slowly. Okay, maybe I should model it as the antiproton is at rest, and the
