Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Lagrangian of an interaction term, and I need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant kappa and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, γ matrices are the Dirac gamma matrices. So the term involves the field strength tensor F, which is related to the electromagnetic field tensor or something similar. Wait, but in this case, maybe it's a non-Abelian field? Or perhaps it's just a spinor field interacting with a photon or something.

First, I think I need to figure out the mass dimension of each field and term in the Lagrangian. Because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless and we integrate over four dimensions. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's consider each component.

ψ is a Dirac spinor. Dirac spinors have mass dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint, ψ^dagger γ^0) has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and some constants. Each gamma matrix is dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is μν antisymmetric, and its dimension... I think for electromagnetism, the gauge field A has dimension 1. Because F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

Putting it all together. The product ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) = 3. Then multiplying by F gives 3 + 2 = 5. So the whole term is κ times something with dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So we have:

κ * (dimension 5 term) must have dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, let me double-check. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3. F is 2. So 3+2=5. So κ must have dimension 4-5 = -1. Yep, that's correct.

So the first part, the mass dimension of κ is -1, so options A and C are left. Now, is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. Remember, in four dimensions, the theory is renormalizable if the coupling has positive mass dimension because that means you can have a finite number of terms (i.e., the interactions are "safe" in the UV). Wait, or is it that the coupling has non-negative mass dimension? Let me think.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence of the Feynman diagrams. For a theory to be renormalizable, all its interaction terms must have couplings with mass dimension ≥ 0. Alternatively, when the coupling has positive mass dimension, the interaction becomes weak at high energies, which is good for renormalizability.

Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian of the form L = g φ^n must have g with mass dimension ≥ (4 - n × (d/2)), where d is the mass dimension of the field φ. So since in 4D, each field φ has dimension d = (mass dimension) = (4 - 2)/2 = 1 for scalars. Wait, wait, no, wait. For a scalar field φ, the kinetic term is (∂φ)^2, which is dimension 4. So (∂φ)^2 → (mass^1 term)^2 → φ has dimension 1. For Dirac spinors, the kinetic term is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. Each ψ is dimension 3/2 because (3/2)*2 =3, plus ∂ which is 1 gives 4. So ψ is 3/2.

In our case, the interaction term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me count the number of fields: two ψ (ψ̄ and ψ) and one F. Each ψ is 3/2, so two of them give 3. F has dimension 2. So total fields contribute 3 + 2 =5. The term is dimension 5. The Lagrangian must be 4, so κ is -1.

Wait, but for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ (mass dimension) ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because a coupling with negative dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, which can lead to non-renormalizable divergences.

So κ has dimension -1, which is negative. That means the theory is not renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable. Looking back at the options, option C says mass dimension -1 and not renormalizable. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think again. The term in the Lagrangian is an interaction term. The general rule is that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for the term κ ψ̄ σ F ψ, the product of fields has dimension 5, so κ must be -1. For renormalizability, all coupling constants must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Since κ is -1, it's non-renormalizable. So option C is correct.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \), \( \psi \) is a Dirac spinor, and \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} \), and so does \( \bar{\psi} \).
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has mass dimension \( 2 \), as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \) (which has mass dimension \( 1 \)) and its derivatives.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \). Breaking it down:
- \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has mass dimension \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \) (since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless).
- \( F^{\mu\nu} \) contributes an additional mass dimension of \( 2 \).
- Thus, the total dimension of the field product is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).

The Lagrangian must have mass dimension \( 4 \) in four spacetime dimensions. Therefore, \( \kappa \) must have mass dimension \( 4 - 5 = -1 \).

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \( \kappa \) has mass dimension \( -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to non-renormalizable divergences. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:
