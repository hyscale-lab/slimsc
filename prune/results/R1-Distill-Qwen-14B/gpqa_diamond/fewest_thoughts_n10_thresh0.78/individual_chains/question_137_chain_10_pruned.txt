Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cyclotrons, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Let's see what's given. A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data provided is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, so the voltage is time-dependent and has a phase shift of π/4. But I'm not sure how that phase affects the number of revolutions. Maybe it's not directly relevant here? Or perhaps it's part of the setup for determining the frequency or something.

I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The key point is that the cyclotron frequency is such that the time for one revolution is the same as the period of the applied voltage. So the particles are accelerated each time the electric field is in the right direction during their orbit.

But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron. Oh right, synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field is not constant. Instead, it increases with time to keep the particles in phase with the accelerating voltage. That's important because it allows for higher energies than a regular cyclotron.

So, for a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particles gain energy. The cyclotron frequency, which is usually ω = qB/(m), would change because B is changing. But since the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage, the frequency ν should match the orbit frequency at each step.

The kinetic energy the proton reaches is 950 MeV. Since the initial kinetic energy is negligible, the proton starts from rest and is accelerated up to this energy. So the total energy gained is 950 MeV.

The accelerating voltage is given as U0 cos(2π ν α t + Φ0). Oh wait, wait. The acceleration voltage is U(t). But the effective acceleration
