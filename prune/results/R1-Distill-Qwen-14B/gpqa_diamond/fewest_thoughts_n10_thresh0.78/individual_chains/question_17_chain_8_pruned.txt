Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details about EDTA complexes. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The given information is that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are given, so I just need to figure it out.

Hmm, wait, what's the formula for this kind of problem? I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so I guess the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions, right?

The formation constant, K, which is given as 5x10^10, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. So the K expression would be K = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, I think [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Since it's a stoichiometric solution, maybe all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex?

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. That usually means that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are equal because the reaction is 1:1. So, for every mole of CaEDTA²−, there's one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

But wait, no. Wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So, in the solution, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentrations before dissociation would be [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would be zero. But that can't be right because the complex can dissociate. Wait, no, no, the solution
