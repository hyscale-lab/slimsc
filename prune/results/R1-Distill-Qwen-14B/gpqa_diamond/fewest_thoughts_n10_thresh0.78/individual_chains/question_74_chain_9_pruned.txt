Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question says: We have a single atom, and we know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key thing is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, no, actually, the probability does depend on the time, but the important point is that the decay process is memoryless. So the past doesn't affect the future probability beyond the fact that the atom hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, let me think again. So, the decay is a Poisson process, right? That means the probability of decay in a given time is independent of when you start measuring. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be the same as the probability of it decaying in a 150-minute period starting from time zero, but adjusted for the fact that it's conditional on it not having decayed yet.

Wait, no. The decay process is such that the probability of decay in any interval is based on the remaining time. So the approach might be to model the decay with an exponential distribution.

The general formula for the probability of decay by time t is P(t)
