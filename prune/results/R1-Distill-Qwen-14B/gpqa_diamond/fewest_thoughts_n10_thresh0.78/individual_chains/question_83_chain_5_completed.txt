Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I guess I'll need to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

I think I should break this down into parts. First, find the initial concentration after dilution. Then, figure out the moles involved in the titration. After that, compute the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the moles of acetic acid initially after dilution.
3. Find out how much NaOH is needed for 25% titration and at equivalence.
4. For each point (25% and equivalence), figure out the resulting solution composition (whether excess of acid or conjugate base) and compute the pH.

Starting with step 1: Dilution calculation.

We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The concentration after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 = 0.05 M, V1 = 0.02 L, V2 = 0.04 L.

So M2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M? Wait wait, wait: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Adding to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

But wait, what is the equivalence point here? Equivalence is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So, let's find moles initially after dilution. The acetic acid is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Molarity = moles / volume, so moles = M * V.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH at equivalence = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but for 25% titration, that would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So NaOH added is 2.5 cm³ at 25% titration.

Wait, but wait—does it mean 25% of the total required NaOH is added, or 25% of the solution's equivalence point? I think it's the former: 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Let me confirm: because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, for each scenario (25% and equivalence), I need to find the pH.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So, let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, they react in a 1:1 ratio: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na^+ + H2O.

So, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.001 moles.

Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.00025 moles. So, moles reacted: 0.00025.

Moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total solution volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So, concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because we have a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base).

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = log(1/(Ka)) = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85) is about 0.267. So 1.85e-5 → log is 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. But wait, that's log(1e-5 is 5). So pKa is 4.733.

So, plugging into Henderson:

pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, that's approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. So that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but wait a second. I should double-check the calculations because the numbers are precise.

Wait, the exact calculation for the ratio: 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. Oh, right! Because when you have 0.00025 and 0.00075, their ratio is 1/3. So the log(1/3) is exactly -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = approximately 4.256, so 4.26. So that's the first pH value.

Now, for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base (acetate ions), and the solution will consist of sodium acetate in solution.

Wait, but wait, when you add an equal amount of NaOH, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid and strong base), which will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So, first, the moles of sodium acetate: 0.001 moles, same as the initial moles of acetic acid.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ NaOH → 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So, the Kb is 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis equation: 

Initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. 

At equilibrium:

CH3COO^- → 0.02 - x

CH3COOH → x

OH^- → x

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small.

So, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x^2 ≈ (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So, [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 M → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9.02. The options are:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option B: 3.17; 6.73

Option D:4.57;6.92

Wait, none of the options have a second pH around 9. Hmm. Did I make a mistake? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternative approach:

At equivalence, all acetic acid is converted to acetate. The solution is 0.02 M acetate. So, the Kb is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

The acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is as I said.

The expression: Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 - x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14-4.98 =9.02.

But none of the options have a second pH near 9, except none of the options here. Wait the options given are A to D, and let me see:

Looking back:

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of the options have 9.02. So this suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me double-check.

Wait, at equivalence, the moles of NaOH are 0.001 (same as acetic acid), so the solution is 0.001 moles of acetate in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb or pOH.

Wait, let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.733.

Kb=1e-14/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should not approximate so much. Let me use the exact formula.

x^2 = Kb * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small, but let's see:

x^2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is negligible compared to 0.02, then x^2 ≈ 1.081e-11 → x≈ 1.04e-5.

Wait, but maybe that's correct. So why are none of the options matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Wait, when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution, the total is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute it without the approximation.

So,

x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02 -x)

Assume x is small, but perhaps not negligible. Let's see, if x is about 1.04e-5, then 0.02 -x ≈ 0.01999896, which is practically 0.02. So the approximation holds. Thus, my initial calculation stands, pH is around 9.02.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps at the equivalence point, the solution is not just acetate. Wait, no, because all the acid is neutralized. So, the solution is just acetate and sodium ions, which are spectator ions.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in using Kb. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: compute the pH using the formula for a weak base.

The formula is:

OH- = sqrt(Kb * C)

Which is what I did. Wait, but perhaps I should compute using more precise calculation.

Wait, but if I don't neglect x, the equation is x² = Kb*(0.02 -x )

Which is a quadratic equation: x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb)=0.

So,

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

Let me compute the discriminant:

sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 *1*(0.02*5.405e-10) )

Which is sqrt( 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-12 )

Wait, 4.324e-12 is much larger than 2.921e-19, so the sqrt is approx sqrt(4.324e-12 )= 2.08e-6.

So solution x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 2.08e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: (-5.405e-10 + 2.08e-6)/2 ≈ (2.08e-6)/2 ≈ 1.04e-6.

Wait, wait, that's different from before. Hmm, but that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² + b x + c =0. Wait, actual equation is x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02*5.405e-10) )=0.

The standard quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). So in this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10 = -1.081e-11.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11) ) ]/(2*1).

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. The square term is negative multiplied by negative, so becomes positive.

So discriminant is 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since the first term is negligible).

So sqrt(4.324e-11) = ~6.576e-6.

Thus,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

Take the positive root:

( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

So x ≈3.29e-6 M.

Wait, that's different. So [OH-] ≈3.29e-6 → pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈5.48. pH =14-5.48=8.52.

Ah! Now that makes sense. So earlier approximation without considering the quadratic gave a higher pH, but this more accurate calculation gives pOH≈5.48, pH≈8.52.

So now the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

Wait, so at equivalence point, pH is ~8.52.

Now, going back to the first part, at 25% titration, we had pH≈4.26. So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26;8.52 → yes, that's what I got.

Wait, but earlier when I did the Henderson calculation, I got pH=4.26. But another thought: did I correctly calculate the ratio?

Because when I have 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate, the ratio is 0.00025/0.00075=1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH=4.733-0.477=4.256, which is 4.26. So that looks correct.

But wait, another point: the solution after adding NaOH is a buffer solution, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch applies.

So, the first pH is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option is A.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the equivalence pH was around 9, but after recalculating using the quadratic equation, it's 8.52. So that must be correct.

So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.020}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the moles of acetic acid after dilution:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = M_2 \times V_2 = 0.025 \times 0.040 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Thus, the volume of NaOH required at equivalence is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH, eq}} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{M_{\text{NaOH}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required for equivalence is added. Therefore, the volume of NaOH added is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH, 25\%}} = 0.25 \times 10 = 2.5 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

### pH at 25% Titration
At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = M_{\text{NaOH}} \times V_{\text{NaOH, 25\%}} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COOH}}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### pH at Equivalence Point
At equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^-}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using a more precise calculation without approximations, the pH at equivalence is found to be approximately 8.52.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at equivalence is 8.52. Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
