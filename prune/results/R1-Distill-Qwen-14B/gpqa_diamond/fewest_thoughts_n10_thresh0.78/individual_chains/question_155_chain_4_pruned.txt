Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, which I remember is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²). So, I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let me understand the setup. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the state vector is expressed in terms of these basis vectors. The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, does that mean it's a three-component vector? So, the system is a three-level system, perhaps?

Wait, the operator P_x has a matrix form given. Let me write that down. The P_x matrix is:

First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0.

Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2.

Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0.

Similarly, P_y and P_z have their own matrices. But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, maybe I don't need to worry about P_y for this problem.

The state vector is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, let me denote this state as |ψ>.

Wait, but before anything else, I should check if this state is normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values.

The first component is (-1/2), squared is 1/4.

Second component is 1/sqrt(2), squared is 1/2.

Third component is (-1/2), squared is 1/4.

Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 =1. So, yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation values should be manageable.

Wait, because if the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, then each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. Let me think. So, the matrix P_z is diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. Looking at P_z:

First row: ħ, 0, 0.

Second row: 0, 0, 0.

Third row: 0,0, -ħ.

So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

Ah, so the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, the state |ψ> is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write |ψ> as a linear combination.

|ψ> = a |+z> + b |0z> + c |-z>.

Looking at the components, the coefficients are:

a = -1/2 (first component)

b = 1/sqrt(2) (second component)

c = -1/2 (third component)

Wait, no, wait. No, no. Wait, no. Wait, in the basis of P_z, the state is written as a column vector with components (a, b, c), which are the amplitudes for each eigenstate. So the first component is the amplitude for |+z>, second for |0z>, third for |-z>.

So, |ψ> is a combination of these three. Now, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is straightforward.

Wait, ⟨P_z⟩ is the expected value, which is the sum over |a|^2 * eigenvalue for each component.

So, for each component:

First term: |a|^2 * ħ = (1/2)^2 * ħ = 1/4 * ħ.

Second term: |b|^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: |c|^2 * (-ħ) = (1/2)^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4)(-ħ).

Adding these up: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

What about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So, the eigenvalues of P_z² are (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 =
