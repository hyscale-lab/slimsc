Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is based on the reaction and the NMR data given. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is provided, and I need to determine which option (A to D) is correct.

First, I should think about what reaction occurs when a compound reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Wait, that's a known reagent, right? Oh, right! It's a strong base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when an epoxide reacts with a strong base, it can undergo ring-opening. But wait, compound X is reacting with this base, which suggests that X might have an epoxide group. Because when epoxides react with bases, the ring can open. But wait, how does that lead to the product? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is some kind of elimination? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has signals at:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR has:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

So first, I think about the 13C NMR. The peak at 197.7 ppm is a strong indicator. That's a pretty high chemical shift, typical for a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an acid. Wait, but wait: another possibility is an epoxide. Wait, no, because epoxide carbons are usually around 40-60 ppm. Oh, wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Or maybe an ester? Hmm.

Wait, but the product is formed after reacting compound X with a base. Let me think about possible reactions. If X is an epoxide, and it's treated with a base, the ring would open. But the product's NMR doesn't show any new oxygen functionality, perhaps an ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack, but the product's structure could be something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them except D are oxiranes. D is 2-styrylepoxide. So each option is an oxirane except D, which is a styrylepoxide. Wait, no, D is an epoxide. So the reaction could be the ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's NMR data: what's the structure that leads to these signals?

Looking at the 1H NMR. The singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm for 3H each suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, perhaps. Or maybe one is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen.

Wait, but in the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 21.3 and 28.4. Those are both quaternary carbons as they're singlets. 21.3 is a low shift, maybe a CH3 attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide's CH3-O-CH2- structure, but not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe they're two different methyl groups.

Looking at the aromatic region in the 1H NMR: we have signals in the 6.75-7.71 range. The 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) probably correspond to a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe a styrene or something similar. The 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) could be a trans double bond, like in a styryl group. So maybe the product has a styryl group (a vinyl benzene).

The 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which I think is a carbonyl. Wait, if the product has a carbonyl group, maybe it's an acid, but more likely a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but the starting material is compound X, which is C11H12O. Let's see the molecular formula of the product. But wait, the product's formula isn't given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. If X is an epoxide, and upon treatment with a base, it ring-opens to form a diol, but the NMR doesn't show any OH groups, so maybe it's an elimination reaction or some rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: the reagent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. It's often used in the epoxide ring-opening, but in some cases, it can lead to elimination reactions if there are adjacent protons. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of ylides, perhaps in Wittig reactions. Wait, but wait, the Wittig reaction typically uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a base-induced elimination.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl group. So perhaps the starting material had an epoxide, and the base caused a ring-opening followed by elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the base induces a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene or something else.

Hmm. Let me think about the options for compound X.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane (epoxide) attached to a 4-methylstyryl group. Structure-wise, that would be an epoxide ring connected to a styryl group where the substituent is in the para position on the benzene ring.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane is attached to a propenyl group that's substituted with a phenyl group at position 1 and at position 2. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-Ph? Or perhaps Ph-
