Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me start by analyzing each of these.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this compound likely has an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but sometimes it can be broad. But also, it can show a peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. Oh, right, the FTIR also has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated group, like an aromatic ring or an amide. But in this case, since the question mentions it's an organic compound, perhaps ester or ketone? Or maybe an acid? Wait, but if it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, which it is, and the carbonyl around 1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester group, which usually has a carbonyl around 1730-1750 cm^-1, but it can vary. Or a ketone at around 1700. Hmm, but if the carbonyl is at 1700, maybe it's an ester or ketone, but the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene. So maybe the structure
