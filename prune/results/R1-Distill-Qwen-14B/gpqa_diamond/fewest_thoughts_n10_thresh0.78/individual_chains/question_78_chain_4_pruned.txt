Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they generate electromagnetic fields, and potentials are involved in their descriptions. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question gives a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity of the charge at that earlier time tr is v. The time t is greater than tr, so we're considering the retarded time scenario, I think.

Wait, the problem is asking for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t and position r. The options are A to D, each with different expressions. I need to recall the correct formulas for these potentials when a charge is moving.

I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there might be some modifications. Oh right, when charges move, the potentials are affected by the motion, and we need to consider the retarded time. But wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that d is the vector from the field generating point (at time tr) to r. So d is the displacement between the charge's position at tr and the observation point.

So the scalar potential for a moving charge, I think, is V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)/c² ), but wait, no. Let me think again. The standard expression for scalar potential when considering retarded time is something like V = q/(4πε₀ |r - r'| ), where r' is the position of the charge at time tr, which is earlier. But in terms of d, which is r - r', so d is the vector from r' to r. So r - r' = d. Therefore, |r - r'| = |d|. But wait, the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d| ), but when the charge is moving, do I need to consider any time delay or motion effects in the potential?

Wait, maybe not for the scalar potential. Or does the motion affect the scalar potential? Or perhaps the scalar potential is still
