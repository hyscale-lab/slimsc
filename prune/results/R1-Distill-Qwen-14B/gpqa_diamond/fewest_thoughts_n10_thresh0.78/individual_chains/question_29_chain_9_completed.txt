Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for synthesizing the compound, which has five exons and four introns. Now, they're using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they sequenced the target gene in all the mutants. The changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon area. The question is, which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound?

So, I remember that mutations can be missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc. Since the mutations are in the first exon, which is expressed (because exons are coding regions), the changes in the DNA sequence would affect the protein product.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different sequence. I need to compare each mutant's DNA to the intact gene and see what kind of mutation they have.

The intact gene is given as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the changes are. The original sequence starts with ATGTTTCT... and the mutant has ATGTTCTA... Wait, let me count the nucleotides.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTCT ACG C... Hmm, perhaps the third triplet is different.

Alternatively, let me write the sequences with their positions. The first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: ATG TT CTA CGC TGG TAC T...

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact positions. Let's compare each part.

Looking at the first 15 nucleotides or so:

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant1: starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTC...

Wait, so the first difference is in the third or fourth codon. Let me count.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT... Hmm, no, wait, the mutant's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Wait, maybe better to split into triplets.

Intact:

1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
...

Mutant1:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: TTT (same)
7-9: CTA (mutated from CTC)
10-12: CGC (instead of GCT)
13-15: TGG (instead of GGT)
16-18: TAC (instead of ACT)
Then the rest seems similar.

Wait, wait, maybe I should write each codon's nucleotides.

Looking at the sequence:

Intact first exon starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the mutations are. Let me align the two.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, the initial part of Mutant1 is ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T...

Hmm, perhaps the first few codons differ.

Wait, let me count each base:

Intact: positions 1-26: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG

Mutant1: starts as ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T ... 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the exact point where the two sequences differ.

In the intact gene, the first part is:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, no, the Mutant1 sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Wait, perhaps the third codon in the mutant is different. Let me compare each position.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So, the first part:

Intact: positions 1-12: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG

Wait, no, perhaps the 7th base is different. Let me write the first 20 nucleotides.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

So, let's line them up:

Intact: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T...
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T...

Wait, no, perhaps the change is in the CTC to CTA.

Wait, the 7th, 8th, 9th nucleotides in the intact are C T C. In mutant1, they are C T A? Let me check.

Wait, the intact gene's 6th,7th,8th nucleotides are T C T (position 6: T, 7: C, 8: T?), no wait, the sixth is the third nucleotide of the second codon.

Wait, maybe I should write each codon for the first few:

Intact:
1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
...

Mutant1:

1-3: ATG (same)
4-6: TTT (same)
7-9: CTA (Leu)
10-12: CGC (Arg)
13-15: TGG (Trp)
16-18: TAC (Tyr)
19-21: TCT (same)
22-24: GTG (same)
...

Wait, so compared to the intact, mutant1 has changes in codons 3 (CTC → CTA, which is still Leu), codon 4 (GCT → CGC, which is from Ala to Arg), codon5 (GGT → TGG, Gly to Trp), codon6 (ACT → TAC, Thr to Tyr). Hmm, so multiple changes. Wait, but is that correct? Because the mutant has a longer change. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the third codon is CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's CTA (Leu) as well. So, same amino acid. Then codon4 is GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg). That's a change. Codon5: GGT (Gly) → TGG (Trp). Codon6: ACT (Thr) → TAC (Tyr). So four changes in a row? That seems like a frameshift, but wait, the length is same. Hmm, but no, because each codon is three nucleotides, so no frameshift. So all four codons are changed, but all are substitutions.

Wait, but looking at the mutant sequences, perhaps it's a single substitution that affects multiple codons. Or maybe it's a deletion or insertion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare the entire sequences as provided.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, let me look for where they differ.

Intact: ATGTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...
Mutant1: ATGTTCT ACG C TGG TAC TCT GTG ...

Wait, perhaps the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Wait, perhaps the difference is in the third codon. Let me compare each nucleotide.

Intact: positions 1-12: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG

Wait, in the third codon (7-9), intact is CTC, mutant1 is CTA. So, the CTC becomes CTA. That's a substitution of the third nucleotide in the third codon. So, codon 3: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu). So, same amino acid. Then, the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), and in mutant1, it's CGC (Arg), which is a different amino acid. So, this is a missense mutation at codon 4.

Then, the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), mutant1 has TGG (Trp). Another substitution. Sixth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), mutant1 has TAC (Tyr). So, four consecutive missense mutations? That seems unlikely, but perhaps it's a point mutation that affects a few bases, but maybe in a way that leads to multiple changes. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in how I'm interpreting the sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 is a substitution in the third codon and beyond. Wait, perhaps I should look at the start of the sequences.

Wait, the intact gene's sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the first 10 nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT G...

Hmm, so, the first difference is at position 7 perhaps. Wait, let me write the sequences:

Intact: 1-12: A T G T T T C T C G C T G
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G

So, in position 7: intact has C, mutant1 has T? No, wait:

Looking at the first 12 nucleotides:

Intact: A T G T T T C T C G C T G
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G

Wait, perhaps the sixth, seventh, and eighth nucleotides are T C T in intact, and T C A in mutant1? So, the seventh position is T → A?

Wait, no, the third codon in intact is CTC, and in mutant1, it's CTA. So, the third codon is CTC → CTA. So, the third nucleotide of the third codon is changed from C to A? Wait, no, because in the third codon, the third base is the third position. So, the first codon is ATG, second is TTT, third is CTC. In mutant1, the third codon is CTA. So, third base changed from C to A. So, CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu). So, same amino acid. So, no effect from that.

But then, the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant1 it's CGC (Arg). So, the third base of the second codon? Wait, no, the fourth codon starts at position 10. Let me think: the first codon is positions 1-3: ATG, second 4-6: TTT, third 7-9: CTC, fourth 10-12: GCT. So, in mutant1, the fourth codon is CGC. So, the first base of the fourth codon is now C, whereas in intact it's G. So, that's a substitution. So, GCT → CGC. So, this is a missense mutation, changing Ala to Arg.

So, in mutant1, the fourth codon is changed, leading to an amino acid substitution. The fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant1 it's TGG (Trp), so that's a substitution as well. Then, the sixth codon in intact is ACT (Thr), in mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr), another substitution.

Wait, that's four changes in a row. That seems like a lot. But perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm counting the nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps the changes are longer. Maybe the mutation is a deletion or insertion. Or perhaps I'm misaligning the sequences.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the actual DNA sequences.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Comparing the two: The first change is at position 6: intact has T, mutant1 has C. Wait, no, looking at the first few letters:

Intact: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C…TGA

Wait, so looking at the first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, the first part where they differ is after the initial ATGTT:

Intact: TCTCGC...
Mutant1: CTACGC...

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon is where the change is.

Wait, perhaps the fourth codon in intact is GCT (positions 10-12: GCT), and in mutant1, it's CGC (positions 10-12: CGC). So, that's a substitution of the first base of the codon. So, GCT becomes CGC. So, that's a change from Ala to Arg.

So, this is a missense mutation at codon 4. But then, looking further, the fifth codon in intact is GGT, in mutant1 it's TGG. So, that's a substitution of the first two bases perhaps. So, GGT (GGT) → TGG (Trp). So, another missense.

Wait, but that would require a substitution in the first two bases of the codon, which seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe another approach. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means the gene product is nonfunctional. So, the mutation should disrupt the gene's function.

So, what kind of mutations would cause the gene to stop being functional? Nonsense mutations (premature stop codons) would likely cause the protein to be truncated, possibly nonfunctional. Missense mutations might not, unless they are in a critical region. Frameshift mutations would change all downstream amino acids.

Looking at the options, I should check each mutant for the presence of a stop codon or a frameshift.

Looking back at the options:

Mutant 1:
Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Does this introduce a stop codon? The stop codons are TAA, TAG, TGA. Looking at the end, it ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. Wait, but the original gene ends with TGA as well. Wait, in the intact gene, the sequence is …TGA, which is the stop codon. So, if the mutant has the same ending, no new stop codon is introduced.

Wait, no, the original gene's stop is at the very end. So, if a mutation creates a stop codon earlier, that would truncate the protein.

Let me check each mutant for any new stop codons.

Intact gene: ...TGA at the end.

Mutant 1: ...TGA at the end as well. So, no new stop codon introduced. So, it's a missense mutation leading to changes in several amino acids.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the sequence, compare to intact.

First, the intact sequence after ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the first part is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT... So, the initial part differs.

Looking for changes in the codons.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

So, in codon 3, CTC → CTA (Leu → Leu), same as before. Codon4: GCT → AGC (Ala → Ser). So, substitution. Codon5: GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp). Codon6: ACT → TAC (Thr → Tyr). So again, multiple changes. No stop codons introduced.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Compare to intact.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC. CTC is Leu, TAC is Tyr. So, substitution. Codon4: GCT → GCT (same). Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me align:

Intact: positions 1-9: ATG TTT CTC
Mutant3: positions 1-9: ATG TTT TAC

So, third codon CTC → TAC. So, Leu → Tyr. Then codon4 in intact is GCT, in mutant3 it's GCT as well. Wait, no:

Wait, the mutant3 sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after ATG TTT TAC, next is GCT, then GGT, etc.

Wait, looking more carefully:

The first change is in the third codon: CTC → TAC.

So, codon3: CTC → TAC. Then, codon4 in intact is GCT, which is same as mutant3 (since GCT is next). But wait, the next part in mutant3 is GGGT, while in intact it's GGTA.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me write the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So, codon3 is changed (CTC → TAC), codon4 remains GCT, codon5 is GGT → GGT (same), but wait, codon6 in intact is ACT (Thr), in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). So, substitution.

So, in mutant3, the changes are: codon3 (Leu → Tyr), codon6 (Thr → Val). No new stop codons.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Compare to intact.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr), codon4: GCT → GCT (same), codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr). That's a big change. Then codon6: ACT → TCT (Thr → Ser).

Wait, no, let me see.

Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, let's split into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (as in mutant3), codon4: GCT remains (Ala), codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr), codon6: TCT (Ser).

Wait, but in the intact, the fifth codon is GGT (Gly), sixth is ACT (Thr). In mutant4, fifth is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser). So, codon5 is changed, and codon6 is changed.

Now, looking for any stop codons:

In mutant4, after the changes, any new stop codons introduced?

Looking at the codon5: GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr). No stop. Codon5 is ACT, which is Thr. Then codon6: TCT (Ser). No stop. So, no new stop codons.

But wait, perhaps one of the mutations caused a frameshift, leading to downstream changes and a premature stop. Frameshifts would disrupt the reading frame, so any stop codon after that would be in a different frame.

Looking at the options, let's check if any of the mutants have insertions or deletions (indels) which would cause frameshifts. Because all the options seem to have substitutions, not indels. Wait, looking at the sequences, they all seem to have the same length. So, the mutations are substitutions, not indels. So no frameshifts.

So, the only way a mutation would lead to a nonfunctional protein is if it introduced a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) or caused a critical missense mutation.

So, looking for mutations that result in a stop codon appearing earlier.

Looking at the mutants:

In Mutant1, the sequence ends with TGA, same as the original. So, no new stop codon. The changes are missense.

Mutant2: same, no new stop codon.

Mutant3: Likewise, no new stop.

Mutant4: Let's check.

Mutant4: ...ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So, let's see if any triplet in the sequence is a stop codon.

Looking at each codon:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
...

No stop codons until the end. Intact has ...TGA, so mutant4 ends with TGA as well. So no new stop codons introduced.

Wait, what about earlier in the sequence? Let's check:

Mutant4's sequence after the fifth codon:

After ACT (Thr), next codon is TCT (Ser), then GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc. No TAA, TAG, or TGA until the end.

So, none of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon. So, how else could the anti-nutritional compound be eliminated?

Perhaps the gene is knocked out, making the compound not synthesized. So, if the protein is not functional, the compound isn't made. So, which mutation would cause the gene product to be nonfunctional?

If a mutation disrupts a critical region, like the start codon or an important domain, the protein might not function.

Looking at the options, perhaps a mutation in the start codon would prevent translation. But looking at the mutants:

All start with ATG, so the start codon is intact. So, the translation can start.

Mutant1: the first codon is same, so the start is fine.

Another possibility is a nonsense mutation (premature stop), but as we saw, none have that except the original which ends at TGA.

Wait, but all the mutants end with TGA, same as original. So, the stop is at the same place. So, the only way the protein is shorter is if a stop codon appears earlier, which none do.

So, perhaps the mutations are in exons, leading to missense changes in important regions. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in a splice site, but the question states that the mutations are in the first exon. So, no introns involved.

Wait, the gene has five exons and four introns. But the mutations are in the first exon, so the alternative splicing is less likely the issue.

If all the mutants have substitutions, then perhaps the question is about which substitution would disrupt the function of the gene product.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the reading frame, causing a frameshift. But earlier, I thought the sequences are aligned with same length, so no frameshifts. Wait, but I should double-check.

Looking at the length of each mutant's sequence.

Intact: ...TGA (same for all mutants). So, the mutations are substitutions, not insertions or deletions, so no frameshifts.

So, the only way is that a missense mutation disrupts a critical region.

But without knowing the exact structure of the protein, it's hard to say which mutation would be critical. Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation would be best, but none have that.

Wait, perhaps I missed looking for any stop codons in the middle.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT …TGA

Wait, any of these triplets are stop codons?

ATG (start), TTT, TAC (Tyr), GCT, ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAA (Gln), TAT (Tyr), TTT (Phe), ATT (Ile), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (stop).

No stop codons before the end.

Mutant3's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons.

Mutant2:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons.

Mutant1:

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons except the last.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon early in the sequence, but that's not happening here.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation is in a critical region like the start codon or an early part of the gene, leading to a nonfunctional protein. But all start with ATG.

Wait, another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. So, if the gene is knocked out, the compound isn't made. So, which mutation would result in a nonfunctional gene?

If the mutation is a nonsense mutation leading to truncation, the gene product is shorter and possibly nonfunctional. But again, none have a premature stop.

Alternatively, a missense mutation in an important region, like the active site of an enzyme, could disrupt function.

But without knowing the exact gene function, perhaps the question is about which mutation would cause a major disruption.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large change in the sequence, leading to a frameshift. Wait, but earlier I thought that the length is same.

Wait, let me check Mutant4's sequence again. The first part is:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, in the first part, after ATG TTT, the third codon in intact is CTC, while in mutant4 it's TAC. Then, the fourth codon in intact is GCT, in mutant4 it's GCT (same). Wait, no, let me check the exact:

Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...
Mutant4: ...TTTACGCTACTTCT...

So, the original after TTT is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4 after TTT is TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). The fourth codon remains GCT (Ala), but the fifth codon changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). So, two changes.

But again, these are substitutions, not frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a deletion or an insertion that I missed. Let me count the number of nucleotides.

The original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, the original has 21 nucleotides in the first part (ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT). Let's count.

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GT → that's 21 nucleotides (7 codons).

Mutant4's first part: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GT → that's also 21 nucleotides. So, same length. So, no frameshift.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, and all are substitutions. So, perhaps the correct approach is to identify which mutation disrupts the reading frame or causes a major change in the protein.

Wait, perhaps none of the options lead to a stop codon, so the way to eliminate the compound is a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function.

But without knowing which codon is critical, perhaps the question is testing for another concept.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation is in the first exon, which is the beginning of the gene. Perhaps the mutation leads to a nonfunctional protein because it disrupts the start codon or the initiation region.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants have ATG, so the start is fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon, so splicing is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Looking for the mutation that introduces a stop codon in the same reading frame.

Wait, looking back:

Mutant1: ...CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

The fourth codon is CGC (Arg), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TAC (Tyr). No stop.

Mutant2: ...AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG...

Codon4: AGC (Ser), codon5: TGG (Trp), codon6: TAC (Tyr).

Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

No stops.

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No stops.

Hmm. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation leads to a frameshift, but I don't think any do because all have same length.

Wait, wait, another thought. The gene has five exons and four introns. So, perhaps the mutation is in the exon-intron boundary and disrupts splicing. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, so perhaps the first exon is being mutated. But again, the question states that the mutations are in the target gene's first exon.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the first exon's mutation affects the start codon or the initial exons, leading to a nonfunctional transcript.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to a truncated protein.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation introduces a stop codon in the same reading frame before the original stop.

Looking back:

Mutant1: Does any codon become a stop before the end?

Looking at the triplets:

ATG (start), TTT, CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATA (Ile), TTT (Phe), ATT (Ile), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (stop).

No stop codons until the end.

Mutant2:

ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), ... TGA.

No stops.

Mutant3:

ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ... TGA.

No stops.

Mutant4:

ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ... TGA.

No stops.

Hmm. So, perhaps the only way is that one of the mutations causes a frameshift, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of nucleotides. Let me check the lengths.

Intact gene: Let's count the first part.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT TGA.

That's 7 codons before GTG, and so on. Each codon is 3 nucleotides.

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGC TGA.

Same length.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGC TGA.

Same length.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT TGA.

Same.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT TGT CGT TGA.

Same.

So, all same length, no frameshifts.

Thus, the only way is that a missense mutation disrupts the protein's function. But which one?

The question asks which mutation will let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the gene product shouldn't be functional anymore.

If the mutation creates a premature stop codon, that would make the protein shorter and possibly nonfunctional. But none of the options introduce a premature stop. So, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a frameshift, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

Wait, looking back at the initial sequences, perhaps one of the mutants introduces a stop codon through a different reading frame.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in a different frame due to a frameshift. But without a frameshift, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, like the start codon or an important domain.

Wait, let me think about the protein structure. The first exon is often the beginning of the protein. So, a mutation in the initial codons could disrupt the entire structure.

Looking at the first few codons:

In Mutant1, the first few changes are Leu, Arg, Trp, Tyr. That's a lot of changes, but perhaps one of them is in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to look for a nonsense mutation, but since none have it, maybe the answer is that none of the options introduce a stop codon, but that's not the case.

Wait, wait, looking at Mutant4 again.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TACGCTACTTCTGT...

In the original, after TTT comes CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: after TTT comes TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, codon3: CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr), codon4: GCT → GCT (same), codon5: GGT → ACT (Gly → Thr). So, codon5 is a big change, from Gly to Thr. Gly is a small, nonpolar residue, Thr is polar. That could disrupt the structure.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the start codon or the initiation region, but all have ATG.

Wait, perhaps a mutation in the first few nucleotides after ATG could disrupt the ribosome binding site, but again, all have ATG.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which mutation affects the splicing. Since the gene has introns, perhaps a mutation in the splice donor or acceptor site could disrupt splicing. But the question states the mutations are in the first exon, which is the beginning, so perhaps the first intron's splice donor site is in the last part of the first exon.

Wait, the first exon is followed by the first intron. So, the splice donor site is at the end of the first exon. If there's a mutation in that region, splicing could be affected.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct mutant has a mutation in the splice site, causing the exon to be skipped or not properly spliced, leading to no functional mRNA.

Looking at the sequences, perhaps the end of the first exon is where the mutation occurs.

In the intact gene, the first exon ends with ...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Looking at the options, which mutant has a change in that area.

Wait, for example, in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCTACTTCTGTGGAT... So, the first exon ends with ACTTCTG... which is similar to the original.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 affects the splice site at the end of the first exon.

The splice donor site (GU) is at the end of the first exon, right before the intron. So, if a mutation occurs there, splicing could be disrupted.

Looking at the sequences, perhaps Mutant4's sequence has a change in that region.

Original first exon ends with ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant4: ...CTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wait, perhaps the first exon in mutant4 ends earlier, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is in the splice donor site, causing the exon to be excluded.

If the first exon is not included, the mRNA would be missing the beginning, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has the largest structural change, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a new start codon downstream, leading to a truncated protein. But that's not present in any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes the fifth codon from GGT (Gly) to GTC (Val), which is a conservative substitution in some cases, but perhaps in the context of the protein, it's critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes two codons, leading to a significant alteration early in the protein.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about what the question is asking again.

The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would occur if the gene is nonfunctional, meaning the protein isn't made or is made nonfunctional.

Looking at the options, the only way this can happen with the given data is if a mutation introduces a premature stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Wait, perhaps the EMS mutagenesis caused a deletion that removes a critical part of the gene. But the question says the mutations are substitutions, as the sequences are same length.

Unless I'm missing a stop codon in one of the mutants.

Wait, looking again at Mutant1: ...CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stop codons.

Mutant2: ...AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No stop.

Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop.

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

No stop.

So, no premature stops.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function by a nonsense mutation elsewhere, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, leading to exon skipping or inclusion of intronic sequences. But the mutations are in the first exon, so perhaps the splice donor site is affected.

The splice donor site is usually at the end of the exon, with a GU sequence. If a mutation occurs there, it could disrupt splicing.

Looking at the sequences, perhaps the first exon's end in one of the mutants has a mutation in the GU.

But looking at the sequences, I don't see any changes in the GU region.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is in the first intron's splice donor site, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about each option:

Option C is Mutant1. Its fourth codon is CGC (Arg), which is a charged residue. The original was GCT (Ala), which is nonpolar. So, a change from Ala to Arg could disrupt the structure.

Option D is Mutant4, which changes two codons: third to TAC (Tyr), fifth to ACT (Thr). So, two changes.

Option B is Mutant3, which changes the third codon to TAC (Tyr) and sixth to ACT (Thr).

Option A is Mutant2, which changes the third codon to CTA (Leu), fourth to AGC (Ser), fifth to TGG (Trp), sixth to TAC (Tyr).

I think the correct answer is the one where a critical region is disrupted. Since the question doesn't provide more info, perhaps the best way is to look for a nonsense mutation, but none have it. Alternatively, the correct answer is the one where a frameshift occurs, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small residue, so changing to Thr (which is polar and has a hydroxyl group) might disrupt the structure, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes four codons in a row, leading to significant changes in the protein, possibly disrupting its function.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns. So, the exons are joined after splicing. If a mutation occurs in the first exon, perhaps it disrupts the mRNA's start, leading to no translation.

But all the mutants have ATG as the start, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon downstream, leading to a truncated protein.

Looking for any new ATG in the mutants.

Mutant1 sequence: ...CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No new ATG.

Mutant2: ...AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT...

No ATG.

Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

No ATG.

Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG...

No ATG.

So, no new start codons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 changes the reading frame, but that would require an indel.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a change in the fifth codon, which could be in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, going back to the question, the gene is for an anti-nutritional compound. So, the goal is to disrupt the gene's function. The best way is to create a premature stop codon. But none of the options do that.

Wait, perhaps the gene's function is to produce an enzyme that synthesizes the compound. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound isn't made.

So, perhaps any mutation that disrupts the enzyme's active site would work.

But without knowing which codons are in the active site, it's hard to tell.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is the one where the most critical codons are mutated.

But in the absence of specific info, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces the most drastic changes.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1 changes four codons in a row, leading to significant changes.

Mutant3 changes two codons.

Mutant4 changes two codons.

Mutant2 changes four codons.

So, perhaps Mutant1 and Mutant2 have more changes, making them more likely to disrupt the gene.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the gene has five exons, meaning the mRNA is longer. A mutation in the first exon might be in a critical region, such as the signal peptide or a transmembrane domain.

But again, without specific info, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr), which could disrupt a Gly-rich region, which is common in certain structures.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible answers again. The options are A to D.

The correct answer is likely the one that introduces a frameshift, but I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon, which is in the middle of the exon.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it changes the sequence from GGT to ACT, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the mutation that introduces a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes from GGT to ACT, which is a Gly to Thr substitution. Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Thr is polar and has a hydroxyl group. This might disrupt the protein's structure if it's in a critical area.

But again, without knowing the exact location, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3, which changes the third codon to TAC (Tyr). If that's in a critical region, it could disrupt the protein.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes CGC to Arg, which is a charged residue, disrupting the structure.

But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the concept that a mutation in the first exon leading to a frameshift would disrupt the entire reading frame, leading to a nonfunctional protein. But the sequences don't show any frameshifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon to ACT (Thr), which could disrupt a critical region.

But in the end, I think the correct approach is to look for which mutation introduces a premature stop codon. Since none do, perhaps the correct answer is that none of them work, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fifth codon, which could be in a critical region.

Wait, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one that changes the fifth codon, leading to a significant alteration in the protein structure, thus disrupting the gene's function.

So, I'll go with answer D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or by causing significant changes in the protein structure (missense mutations). The mutations are compared to the intact gene sequence:

### Intact Gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

### Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

- Changes: Codon 3 (CTC → CTA, Leu → Leu), Codon 4 (GCT → CGC, Ala → Arg), Codon 5 (GGT → TGG, Gly → Trp), Codon 6 (ACT → TAC, Thr → Tyr).
- No premature stop codons introduced.
- Multiple missense mutations, but no clear indication of a critical disruption.

### Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

- Changes: Codon 3 (CTC → CTA, Leu → Leu), Codon 4 (GCT → AGC, Ala → Ser), Codon 5 (GGT → TGG, Gly → Trp), Codon 6 (ACT → TAC, Thr → Tyr).
- No premature stop codons introduced.
- Similar to Mutant 1, multiple missense mutations but no clear critical disruption.

### Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

- Changes: Codon 3 (CTC → TAC, Leu → Tyr), Codon 6 (ACT → GTC, Thr → Val).
- No premature stop codons introduced.
- Fewer changes compared to Mutant 1 and Mutant 2, but the substitution of Leu → Tyr in Codon 3 could be significant.

### Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

- Changes: Codon 3 (CTC → TAC, Leu → Tyr), Codon 5 (GGT → ACT, Gly → Thr).
- No premature stop codons introduced.
- Two changes, but the substitution of Gly → Thr in Codon 5 could disrupt a critical region of the protein.

### Key Observations:
1. **No Premature Stop Codons**: None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) before the original stop codon at the end of the sequence.
2. **Missense Mutations**: All mutants involve substitutions (missense mutations) rather than insertions or deletions (indels), so there are no frameshifts.
3. **Critical Changes**: Mutant 4 introduces a significant change by altering Codon 5 (GGT → ACT, Gly → Thr). This substitution could disrupt a critical region of the protein, as Gly is a small, nonpolar residue, and Thr is polar with a hydroxyl group, potentially altering the protein's structure or function.

### Conclusion:
While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4 stands out as the most likely to disrupt the gene's function due to the critical nature of the substitution in Codon 5. This makes it the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
