Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. It says that there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E, where E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

Wait, right, the energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are quantized. The formula is E_n = n² * E, where E is the base unit given. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n. But wait, these particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers.

But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n, and the spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, they have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

So the system is four particles, each in different states. Let me think about how to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states, considering the Pauli exclusion.

The ground state would be the lowest energy where each particle is in the lowest possible energy levels, each with different quantum numbers (since they can't share the same n and spin). So for four particles, they'll fill up the lowest n's with two particles each if possible.

Wait, but each n can hold two particles due to spin. So let's see:

n=1: can have two particles (spin up and down)
n=2: same, two particles
n=3: can't have any, because we have four particles already. Wait, no, four particles: n=1 has two, n=2 has two. That's four. So the ground state would have all four particles in n=1 and n=2, each with their spins.

Wait, no, each n holds two particles. So n=1 can take two (spin up and down), n=2 can take two more. So ground state is n=1 and n=2 filled, each with two particles.

So the energies for each particle are E_1 and E_2, each with two particles.

Wait, but each particle is in a different state, so the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles have E_1, which is 1²E = E, and two have E_2, which is 2²E=4E.

Wait, but wait, no. E is actually given as E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, etc.

So the total energy of the ground state would be 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.

But wait, let me think again. Each particle's energy is E_n for their n. So for the ground state, with two in n=1 and two in n=2, the total is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E?

Wait, but looking at the options, option B has ground state 4E, which is E_2. Option C has ground state 4E as well. Option A starts at 30E, which seems high. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So the system's total energy, not individual particle energies.

Wait, so in the ground state, the four particles are arranged to minimize the total energy. So each particle is in the lowest possible n, each with unique quantum states.

So the lowest possible arrangement is two particles in n=1 (each with different spins) and two in n=2 (each with different spins). So the total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, four particles can't all be in n=1 because each n can hold two particles (due to spin). So for four particles, you need two n levels: n=1 and n=2, each holding two particles. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But looking at the options, option B says ground state is 4E, which doesn't make sense because that would imply all particles are in n=2, which isn't possible because n=1 is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Maybe the system's ground state isn't the same as filling n=1 and n=2. Hmm.

Wait another approach: for four identical fermions in a 1D box, each with spin 1/2, the ground state would have the lowest possible energy by having the lowest possible n's filled, each with two particles (since each n can have two due to spin).

So the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can each hold two, so four particles.

So in ground state:

n=1: two particles → energy each is E (1²E)
n=2: two particles → energy each is 4E (2²E)
Total energy = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

So ground state is 10E.

But that's not matching any of the options. Looking at the options:

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E → ground state 4E, which is not matching 10E.

Option C: 4E,10E,15E → same as B for ground state.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, so maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's think again. Is the ground state where all four particles are in the same n=1? No, because Pauli's exclusion says each n can have only two. So four particles would have to go into two different n's.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the state of the individual particles, but the energies are the sum of their individual n² E. So for the ground state, particles fill up the lowest possible n with maximum possible occupancy considering spin.

Yes, so the ground state would have the first two n's filled. So two in n=1 (each with spin up and down), two in n=2 (each with spin up and down). So total energy is 2E (from n=1) plus 2*(4E) (from n=2) → 2E +8E=10E. So ground state is 10E.

But looking at the options, option D starts with 10E as the ground state. Option D is D) 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, but what about the first and second excited states? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the excited states are formed.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be the next lowest energy state achievable by moving one particle to a higher n. So, to find the first excited state, I need to determine the configuration where the total energy is the next higher than 10E.

But how?

I think I need to find the next possible configuration after the ground state. The ground state is n=1 filled with two particles and n=2 filled with two particles.

Now, for the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. Let's see:

Before: two in n=1 (E), two in n=2 (4E each).
After: one in n=3 (9E), and one remains in n=2.

So the configuration would be:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E
n=2: 1 particle → 4E
n=3: 1 particle →9E
So total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, can a particle move from n=2 to n=3? Because moving a particle to a higher n would increase the energy, but perhaps that's the first excited state.

Alternatively, maybe two particles are in higher n's.

Another possibility is that in the first excited state, the configuration is three particles in n=1 and one in n=2, but wait, no, because n=1 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In the ground state, all four particles are in the two lowest n's. For the first excited state, perhaps you promote one of the particles from n=2 to n=3.

So, in the first excited state, you have:

n=1: two particles → 2E
n=2: one particle →4E
n=3: one particle →9E
Total energy =2E +4E +9E =15E.

So the first excited state's energy is 15E.

Then the second excited state. What would that look like? Well, maybe another promotion. Either move another from n=2 to n=3, but wait in the first excited state, n=2 has one particle left. So to promote another, you can move that to n=3, but wait, n=3 can hold two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, no, because each n can have two particles. So in the first excited state, n=3 has one particle. So we can add another to n=3, making it two particles. That would require moving another from n=2 to n=3. But wait, in the first excited state, n=2 has only one particle. So perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the second excited state is when two are in n=3.

Wait, but let's re-express the first excited state.

Wait, initially, all four are in n=1 and n=2. First excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Total energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then, the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, so n=2 has zero and n=3 has two. So total energy is 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But wait, is this the next state? Or is there a lower energy state that hasn't been considered?

Wait, another option for the second excited state could be moving a particle from n=1 to a higher n. But since n=1 is lower, moving a particle up would increase the total energy more.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would have higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, let's think about possible states and their energies.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

What about the second excited state? Let's see. It would be the next possible configuration.

Another possibility for the first excited state is promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3, but that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=2. So let's calculate that again.

Wait, in the ground state, the four particles are n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). The first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

The second excited state would be the next possible energy level. That could be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=3:2. So then, n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. The total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 2*9E (n=3) = 2E +18E=20E. So the second excited state is 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E as an option. The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B) 4E, 10E,50E

C) 4E, 10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, but option D's second excited state is 18E. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm considering the states.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's list all possible configurations and their energies, then pick the ground, first, second excited states.

The ground state is the lowest possible. The first excited is the next higher, and so on.

Possible configurations (all must have four particles):

1. (2 in n=1, 2 in n=2) → energy 10E.

2. (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3) → 2E +4E +9E =15E.

3. (2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3) →2E + 18E=20E.

4. (1 in n=1, 3 in n=2) → but n=2 can't have 3, since each n can have two. So this is invalid.

Wait, n=2 can have two, so perhaps (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3). Wait, but that would be four particles: 1+2+1=4. So energy would be E +8E +9E=18E.

Is that a possible configuration?

So what's the order of energies?

Ground state: 10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

Because 18E is higher than 15E.

Wait, but what about the configuration (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3) → 1E +8E +9E=18E.

Alternatively, another configuration could have two in n=2 and two in n=3: 8E + 18E=26E. But that's higher than 18E.

So the possible energies in order are 10E, 15E, 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but why is the first excited state 15E and the second 18E?

Because 15E is lower than 18E, so it comes first.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second is 18E.

So looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy levels of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length \( L \). The energy levels for a particle in such a well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each quantum number \( n \) can hold two particles due to the two possible spin states (up and down).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The lowest two levels are \( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \), each of which can hold two particles. Thus, the configuration is:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot E_1 = 2E \),
- Two particles in \( n=2 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot E_2 = 2 \cdot 4E = 8E \).

The total energy of the ground state is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
The first excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. This occurs when one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \), contributing \( 2E \),
- One particle in \( n=2 \), contributing \( 4E \),
- One particle in \( n=3 \), contributing \( 9E \).

The total energy of the first excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
The second excited state is the next higher energy configuration. This occurs when another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \), contributing \( 2E \),
- Zero particles in \( n=2 \),
- Two particles in \( n=3 \), contributing \( 2 \cdot 9E = 18E \).

The total energy of the second excited state is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

However, upon reevaluating possible configurations, a valid second excited state arises when the configuration is:
- One particle in \( n=1 \), contributing \( E \),
- Two particles in \( n=2 \), contributing \( 8E \),
- One particle in \( n=3 \), contributing \( 9E \).

The total energy for this configuration is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Final Answer
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 10E, 15E, 18E.**
