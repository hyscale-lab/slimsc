Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and figure out what it's asking.

Alright, the problem says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, and when combined, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with m (the z-component) being -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z of each electron. They're asking for the joint probability that both measurements yield -ħ each. The options are A) 2/3, B)1, C)1/2, D)0.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. Each electron has an l of 1, so their individual m values can be -1, 0, or +1. When you couple two l=1 particles, the total angular momentum l can range from |1-1|=0 to 1+1=2. So l can be 0, 1, or 2. But in this case, the state is |1,1,2,-1>, meaning the total l is 2 and m is -1.

I remember that in angular momentum coupling, the state is a combination of all possible ways to get the total l and m from the individual states. But how does this affect the individual m₁ and m₂ values?

Wait, the state |l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, m=-1> is a specific state. But when you measure L₁z and L₂z, you're looking at the individual m₁ and m₂ quantum numbers. Because L₁z = ħ m₁, and similarly for L₂z.

So the state given is a coupled state, which is a linear combination of the product states |m₁, m₂>. So to find the probability, I need to know the expansion of this coupled state into the product basis.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The coupled state is |m_total> = |m₁ + m₂>, correct? Because m is additive in each direction. So for each possible m₁ and m₂, m_total = m₁ + m₂.

In the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is -1. So from m₁ and m₂, their sum must be -1. So possible m₁ and m₂ pairs could be:

m₁ = -1, m₂=0 → sum -1

m₁=0, m₂=-1 → sum -1

m₁=-1, m₂=0 → same as first.

Wait, but wait, wait. The possible m₁ and m₂ for each electron are -1, 0, +1. So for the total m to be -1, the possible pairs (m₁, m₂) are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and (1, -2) but wait, m₂ can't be -2 because l=1, so m can't be less than -1. So the only possible pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, no, because m₂ can be -1, 0, +1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1 → m₁ and m₂ can each be:

-1 + 0 = -1

0 + (-1) = -1

Wait, but m₁ and m₂ can't be more than 1 or less than -1. So yeah, only those two possibilities.

Wait, no, wait another moment. Because if m₁ is -1 and m₂ is 0, sum is -1. If m₁ is 0 and m₂ is -1, sum is -1. Also, if m₁ is +1 and m₂ is -2, but m₂ can't be -2 because l=1, so that's not allowed. So only two possibilities.

So the product states that contribute to the |m=-1> state are |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

But the coupled state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of these product states. The expansion coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 angular momenta. Hmm, I remember that for two p orbitals, the coupling can give a total l of 0, 1, or 2. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 would involve the combination of the m₁ and m₂ that sum to -1.

The general formula is:

|l₁ m₁> ⊗ |l₂
