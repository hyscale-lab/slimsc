Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a Pi-plus pion at rest decaying into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The given rest masses are 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. Wait, no, the mu-plus is the muon, right.

Wait, the equation is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. So the decay products are a muon and a neutrino. Since neutrinos are leptons but have negligible mass, I can probably treat the neutrino's mass as zero. That's a common approximation, I think.

So the pion is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. In the center-of-momentum frame (which is the same as the pion's rest frame), the total momentum of the products must be zero as well. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but directions are opposite.

I remember that in such decay problems, energy and momentum conservation apply. So the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the pion is at rest, and the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta, their energies will be related to their masses and momenta.

Let me think about the energy conservation equation. The total energy after decay should equal the total energy before decay. So:

E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino

But since the pion is at rest, E_pion = m_pion * c², which is 139.6 MeV.

For the muon and neutrino, their energies are given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) divided by c², but since we're working in units where c=1, it simplifies. So E_muon = sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 ), and E_neutrino = p, since m_neutrino is zero. Wait, because for the neutrino, since m is zero, E = p.

So the total energy after decay is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p.

Set that equal to m_pion:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, okay. Let me denote m_mu as m, which is 105.7 MeV, and p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. So:

sqrt(p² + m²) + p = M, where M is 139.6 MeV.

I need to solve this equation for p. Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + m²) + x = M

Let me rearrange this equation: sqrt(x² + m²) = M - x

Now square both sides:

x² + m² = (M - x)^2 = M² - 2 M x + x²

Subtract x²
