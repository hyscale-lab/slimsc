Alright, so I've got this biology problem here about a transgenic mouse model and some issues with protein expression. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

Okay, the setup: The researcher wants to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They made a transgenic mouse model where they can induce overexpression of this gene. The plan is to affinity-purify the protein and find its binding partners after infecting the mice with the virus.

To do this, they modified the gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the HA tag is at the beginning of the GADD45G protein. Then they transfected a plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies to test expression, but couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is in the construct's nucleotide sequence. They provided the plus strand sequence, and I need to figure out why the overexpression isn't working.

Looking at the options:

A) The HA antigen sequence has a missense mutation. So, maybe the HA tag isn't correctly inserted, causing the protein to not be recognized for affinity purification or maybe the mutation affects function. But the problem here is overexpression isn't happening, not necessarily the functionality.

B) The ribosome terminated translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the construct has a stop codon early on, the ribosome would stop making the protein, leading to no overexpression.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus and there's no linker, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But proteolysis usually leads to lower levels, not no expression. Unless the protease is really efficient.

D) Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. So if the mouse's tRNA doesn't recognize UAA, but wait, in eukaryotes, stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. So every organism should have mechanisms to recognize these. But wait, perhaps the construct has a UAA in the coding region, which might not be a stop codon if it's in the middle of a reading frame. Alternatively, if the construct has a UAA somewhere that's supposed to be a codon, but the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for it. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon, not a standard amino acid.

Wait, let me think about the sequence provided. The coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then goes through various nucleotides. I need to look for any stop codons in the sequence. Since it's the plus strand, the coding sequence is in the same direction as the plus.

Wait, I can scan the sequence for the stop codons. Let's see: the sequence is 5' to 3'. The reading frame would be the mRNA's 5' to 3' direction. So the construct is a coding sequence, meaning it's in the same direction as the mRNA.

So looking for UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking in the provided DNA sequence:

Looking for triplets that would be UAA, etc., in the mRNA. Since DNA is plus strand, the mRNA is complementary.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to look for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, the given DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to the DNA's non-template strand. Wait, no, the coding strand is same as mRNA, except T→U.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In a DNA coding sequence, the DNA is the same as the mRNA except T instead of U. So the mRNA is synthesized from the template strand, which is complementary to the coding (plus) strand.

So the provided DNA sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA is the same as this, with T→U.

So in the mRNA, any in-frame UAA, UAG, UGA would be stop codons.

If the construct has an in-frame stop codon, that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein if the stop is before the HA tag.

Looking through the DNA sequence for any occurrence of the stop codons in the mRNA.

So looking for the triplet combinations:

Looking for UAA: the mRNA would have UAA as TGA in the DNA (since DNA is coding, so mRNA is same as DNA but T→U). Wait, no:

Wait, the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA except T to U. So for the mRNA to have a UAA stop codon, the DNA would have TAA. Similarly, UAG is TAG in DNA, and UGA is TGA in DNA.

So looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in the DNA sequence.

Looking through the sequence.

Let me scan for these triplets.

The given DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TGT CAG AGT CAG CCC AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTT GTC GGG TGC GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACC TGG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACT CGA CAT ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC AGG AGG CGG GGC GGC CAG TCC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTG GAA GGA GAG CCC GCG CGT TAA CGA TGG GTC CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Let me look for TGA. Scanning from the start:

Positions where TGA occurs...

Looking for T followed by G followed by A.

Looking:

After ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA... Oh wait, here we go: "TGA" appears in the sequence. Let me check.

Looking:

After the start ATG, the next part is TAC, CCA, TAC, etc. Wait, in the DNA sequence, positions 1-3: ATG (start codon). Then TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA.

So the DNA at positions 27-29 (if I count correctly): the sequence is TGA in the plus strand. So in mRNA, this would be UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the construct has a UGA (from TGA in DNA) in the coding sequence. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. That means the ribosome would terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein.

But wait, the researcher's construct is supposed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If there's a stop codon in the middle, the protein won't be expressed beyond that point.

So during translation, the mRNA would be read until the UGA, which is a stop codon. So the resulting protein would be shorter than expected, or maybe not expressed at all if the stop is in the beginning.

But in the given sequence, the HA is at the N-terminus. Let's see where the stop codon occurs.

The HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the construct is HA-GADD45G. So the coding sequence starts with ATG (start) followed by HA, then the rest of GADD45G.

If the stop codon (UGA) is somewhere in the middle, the protein would be shorter. If the stop is before the HA is even completed, then the HA might not be present, causing the protein not to be detected by the HA antibody, but in this case, the issue is the inability to overexpress, not detection.

Wait, perhaps the stop codon is after the HA. Let me count.

Wait, the HA tag's coding sequence isn't given, but the sequence starts with ATG. The HA is added before the GADD45G, so the coding sequence is HA followed by GADD45G.

But regardless, the presence of an in-frame stop codon would cause the premature termination of translation.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would fit if there's an in-frame UGA in the construct.

But wait, how did the UGA get into the construct? The researcher added the HA tag. Did they perhaps include a stop codon unintentionally?

Alternatively, perhaps during the cloning process, the reading frame was messed up, leading to a premature stop.

So given the options, option B seems to be the reason. The presence of a stop codon (UGA) in the DNA would cause the ribosome to terminate early, resulting in no overexpression of the full-length protein.

Wait, but in the given DNA sequence, the TGA is in the middle. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop, producing a truncated protein. But the researcher expects overexpression of the full-length HA-GADD45G. So the absence of full-length protein would explain why they can't overexpress it.

So the issue is premature termination due to an in-frame UGA codon in the construct.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes, that's the cause. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option A: Missense mutation in HA. That would mean the HA tag is mutated, but that wouldn't prevent overexpression. The protein would just be expressed but with a mutation. So the expression level would still be the same; it's just the function that's affected. But the researcher's problem is lack of overexpression, not a functional issue.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the protein is being degraded, perhaps you get lower levels, but not necessarily no expression. Also, the question states they couldn't overexpress it, so it's more about the protein not being made rather than being made and broken down.

Option D: Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. So if the mRNA has UAA, which is a stop, then the ribosome stops. But in the DNA, the plus strand has TAA. Let me check the DNA for TAA.

Looking through the DNA sequence, I don't see TAA. So the mRNA's UAA would be
