Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the expectation value of a certain operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. Right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. I think expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I'll need to compute the expectation of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute the expectation of σz. Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is given as ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients. Let's compute them:

For |↑⟩: (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so probability is 0.25.
For |↓⟩: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So that's 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, that's right? Because |↑⟩ has a lower coefficient, so there's a higher chance of being in |↓⟩, which has eigenvalue -1. So the expectation is negative, makes sense.

Now for σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨σx⟩ by using the expectation formula, but since σx is Hermitian, perhaps I can find it using the given state ψ.

Wait, σx is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you apply it to a state, it swaps the components. But to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute the expectation value by ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that for a spin-½ particle, the expectation value of σx is (ψ₁ ψ₂* + ψ₂ ψ₁*) where ψ is [ψ₁; ψ₂]. Wait, let me make sure. The Pauli matrices have specific expectation value formulas.

Alternatively, I can write the state in vector form. Let's see, here ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ is:

ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The expectation value of σx is ψ† σx ψ. Let me compute that.

σx is [[0, 1],[1, 0]]. So σx ψ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Wait, wait. Let me do the matrix multiplication step by step.

Alternatively, compute ψ† σx ψ as the sum over i,j of ψ_i* (σx)_ij ψ_j.

Or since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], ψ† σx ψ would be ψ1* ψ2 + ψ2* ψ1.

Ah, that's simpler. Because when you multiply the matrices, the diagonal elements (σx) are 0, and you get the off-diagonal terms. So:

⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) 

Wait, but wait, the first term is ψ1* times σx_{12} times ψ2, which is ψ1* ψ2. Similarly, the second term is ψ2* times σx_{21} times ψ1, which is ψ2* ψ1.

But wait, wait, σx is real, so ψ1 is 0.5, which is real, and ψ2 is sqrt(3)/2, also real. So ψ1 and ψ2 are real numbers.

So ⟨σx⟩ would be (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

Wait, that's about 0.866. So approximately 0.866.

Let me compute that more accurately: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1.732/2 is 0.866. So yes, that's right.

So now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, and ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So putting it all together:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (5 * 1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2=4.330125.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875.

Wait, so approximately -0.6699. Rounding to one decimal place would give -0.7, right?

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, 10*(-0.5) is indeed -5. 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2=4.33.

So -5 +4.33 = -0.67 approximately.

Wait, but wait, when we compute 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) exactly, it's (5*sqrt(3))/2. Let's compute that:

5*sqrt(3) is about 5*1.73205 = 8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. So 4.330125.

So adding to -5: 4.330125 -5 = -0.669875.

Rounded to one decimal place: -0.7, because the next digit is 6, which is ≥5, so we round up. Wait no, wait, 0.669875 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals. So for one decimal place, 0.7? Wait, 0.669875 is approximately 0.67. So when rounded to one decimal, it's -0.7, since the first decimal is 6, and the next is 6 (the second decimal place is 6, which is ≥5, so 6 rounds up to 7).

Wait, wait: the number is -0.669875. So up to one decimal, it's -0.7 because the next digit is 6, which is higher than 5. So yes, -0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which would be option C.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which matches.

Alternatively, let me double-check the calculation for σx. Did I compute that correctly?

The state is ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ1 is 0.5, ψ2 is sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σx is ψ1 ψ2 + ψ2 ψ1. Wait, no, wait, I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, no: the expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Since σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, you get [ψ2, ψ1]. Then, when you take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [ψ1*, ψ2*], you get ψ1*ψ2 + ψ2* ψ1.

Since ψ1 and ψ2 are real, this becomes ψ1 ψ2 + ψ2 ψ1 = 2 ψ1 ψ2.

So 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈0.866.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So 5 times that is about 4.33.

So 10*(-0.5) is -5. Then, 4.33 minus 5 is -0.67, approximately. So the expectation is about -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Because 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So the coefficients are correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the general formula for expectation values.

The Pauli matrices: σz is diagonal, σx is off-diagonal.

Alternatively, I can write ψ as a vector [a, b]^T, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

Then, the expectation value of σz is (a^2 - b^2) because σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so expectation is a²*(+1) + b²*(-1).

Wait, wait: σz's expectation value is (a² - b²) because a² is the probability of |↑⟩ (eigenvalue +1) and b² is the probability of |↓⟩ (eigenvalue -1). So,

a² = 0.25, b² = 3/4 → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's correct.

Now, for σx, I remember that the expectation value is 2ab, because for spin-½, σx = 2|+x⟩⟨-x| -, wait no, perhaps it's better to just compute it as 2ab.

Wait, let me think: the general formula for spin-x component is ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(ψ₁ ψ₂^*). Since ψ₁ and ψ₂ are real, this is 2 ψ₁ ψ₂.

So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So that's correct.

So combining, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*1.732)/2.

Wait, 5 *1.732 is 8.66, divided by 2 is 4.33. So -5 +4.33 = -0.67. So as before, approximately -0.7.

So the correct answer should be option C) -0.7.


The problem involves calculating the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for a spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle \), where \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \). 

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2(+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1)
\]
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi_1 \psi_2 + \psi_2 \psi_1
\]
where \( \psi_1 = 0.5 \) and \( \psi_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting the values:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \)
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866)
\]
\[
\langle O \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]
Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
