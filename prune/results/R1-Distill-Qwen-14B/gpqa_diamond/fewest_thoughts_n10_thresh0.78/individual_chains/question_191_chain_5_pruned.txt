Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. So that's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2) group? Or wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH2-. But prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2=C(CH2-). Wait no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but the middle is double bond? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2=C(CH2-), no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So the group is CH2-C(CH2-) with a double bond, but maybe it's more accurately written as CH2-CH2-CH2 but replaced. Wait, perhaps it's actually CH2=CHCH2- but attached to the cyclohexane? Wait, no. Wait, let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the substituent is on the second carbon of propene. So it's CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the group would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The starting molecule is cyclohexanone (cyclohex
