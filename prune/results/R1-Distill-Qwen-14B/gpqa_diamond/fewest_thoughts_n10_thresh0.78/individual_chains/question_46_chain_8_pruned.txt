Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products are formed, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs catalyst, specifically, is a transition metal catalyst, usually based on Ruthenium, that facilitates this process. It's good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait, no, waitâ€”racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But in this case, since we're dealing with a starting alkene, I think that might not directly affect the product count unless the reaction is stereoselective.

Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw that. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-C(CH3)2? Or wait, let's count correctly. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong
