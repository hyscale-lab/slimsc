Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm. Let me see.

The question says Mike is using a transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get a very low pressure, less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas molecules are still there. He measures their mean free path as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right?

Then when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. So why would λ change?

Wait, mean free path depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(n * π * d² * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density of the gas, and d is the mean diameter of the gas molecules. Alternatively, another formula is λ = (kt)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). So T is temperature, P is pressure. Oh wait, I think P is pressure, but in another form, pressure is related to number density via n = P/(k*T). So perhaps λ is inversely proportional to pressure and directly proportional to temperature.

But in this case, the pressure is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on because the vacuum level hasn't changed. So why would λ change?

Wait, but when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving at a high speed. Maybe the gas molecules get charged? Like, when the electron beam scatters off the gas molecules, could that cause them to become ionized or something? Because charged particles behave differently in electric fields.

Ionized gas molecules would have different behavior. In an ultra-high vacuum, I suppose the electron beam might cause gas molecules to get ionized, leading to a plasma-like state. But wait, in a normal vacuum, if there's a high voltage, it's possible that the gas molecules get ionized, either positive or negative ions. Or maybe the electrons from the beam interact with the gas, causing electron capture or loss.

If the gas molecules become charged, they would experience forces from the electric field of the electron beam. So, perhaps the charged gas ions would be accelerated or deflected. That might affect their motion, causing more frequent collisions or something else.

Wait, but how would that affect the mean free path? The mean free path is the average distance between collisions. If the gas molecules are ionized, perhaps they are more likely to interact with the walls of the chamber or other charged particles. Alternatively, if they're charged, maybe they're more likely to stick together, increasing the collision rate, thus decreasing the mean free path.

Wait, but wait. In a normal scenario without the electron beam, the gas molecules are neutral and their mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules become ionized, which might make them more likely to be influenced by the electric fields in the microscope or maybe cause them to stick to the walls. Alternatively, the ionized particles might have different cross-sections for scattering.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam provides enough energy to the gas molecules to make them undergo more collisions. So, perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure, making the effective n higher. But wait, the actual pressure hasn't changed. So maybe the presence of the beam changes the way we calculate the mean free path.

Wait, another angle: When the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. The gas molecules in the chamber might get excited or ionized because of the high-energy electrons. If the gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter (d) could change because ions might have different sizes compared to neutral atoms. Or perhaps the cross-section for collisions increases because ions have more charge, leading to more interactions.

Wait, the mean free path formula includes d squared. If ionization increases the effective d, then λ would decrease. Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ would decrease.

Alternatively, if the gas becomes ionized, maybe it's easier for electrons to scatter off these ions. But wait, the electron beam is already there; the gas presence affects the beam. But in this question, the mean free path is about the gas molecules, not the electrons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become ionized, which affects the mean free path. So when the gas is ionized, they have different behavior. Maybe the gas ions are more likely to collide with each other or with the walls, so their mean free path is shorter than before. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So the answer would be C, λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, could the presence of the beam cause other effects? Like, if the gas molecules are ionized, perhaps they're more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment. But wait, the pressure is still the same, because Mike's measurement is based on pressure, which is a measure of the number of particles. Wait, but pressure is P = nRT/V. If the number density n increases (due to some molecules sticking to the walls, perhaps?), but wait, if more particles are sticking, then n would be lower, not higher. Because some particles are out of the gas phase.

Wait, maybe the mean free path is calculated assuming ideal gas behavior. If the gas isn't ideal anymore, maybe because of ionization or sticking, the mean free path changes. But I'm not too sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more energetic. Higher temperature would increase the mean free path because λ is proportional to temperature. But in the scenario, the sample compartment temperature remains the same. So λ shouldn't change because of temperature.

Wait, the initial mean free path λ1 is calculated under vacuum conditions without the beam. Then, when the beam is on, if the gas becomes ionized, perhaps they have different effective cross-sections for scattering. For example, charged particles have a larger effective diameter in terms of scattering. So d increases, which makes λ decrease because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ decreases.

So λ2 would be less than λ1, which is option C.


The question involves understanding how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a vacuum chamber changes when an electron beam is introduced. Initially, Mike measures the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon activating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The temperature remains constant, so it does not directly affect the change in λ.

The mean free path is influenced by factors such as the number density (n) of gas molecules, the effective diameter (d) of the molecules, and the temperature (T). The formula for mean free path is approximately:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \pi d^2 \sqrt{2}}
\]

or equivalently:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(P\) is the pressure, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the pressure and temperature remain constant, any change in λ must arise from changes in the effective diameter \(d\) or other factors.

When the electron beam is introduced, high-energy electrons can interact with gas molecules, potentially ionizing them. Ionized gas molecules (ions) have different effective diameters compared to neutral molecules because their cross-sectional area for collisions increases due to their charged nature. This increase in effective diameter (\(d\)) leads to a decrease in the mean free path (\(\lambda\)), as \(\lambda\) is inversely proportional to \(d^2\).

Thus, the mean free path after the electron beam is turned on (\(\lambda_2\)) is shorter than the mean free path before the beam was activated (\(\lambda_1\)). Therefore, \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).

Answer: C
