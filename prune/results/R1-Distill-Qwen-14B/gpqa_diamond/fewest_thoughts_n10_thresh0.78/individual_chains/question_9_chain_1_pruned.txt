Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about molecules and their symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but let me think through this. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, what's C3h symmetry again? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry where there's a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (Ïƒh) that's perpendicular to that axis. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric when reflected across a plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

The options are four different molecules. Let's go through them one by one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a boron atom attached to three isopropyl groups. The structure is kind of like a trigonal planar around boron. Wait, trigonal planar is symmetric, but does it have C3h symmetry? Well, each isopropyl group is symmetric, but when arranged around boron, each is in a 120-degree position. So if you rotate 120 degrees, it would look the same. But then, do they have a mirror plane perpendicular? I think each isopropyl group is like a methyl group attached to a CH2, but maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, the boron is in the center, and each isopropyl is the same. So perhaps a plane through the boron and each isopropyl's central C? But wait, if the molecule is symmetric when you rotate it 120 degrees, but also has a mirror plane, then yeah, that would give C3h symmetry. Or maybe not. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar arrangement, which might have C3v symmetry instead. C3v is a threefold rotation with vertical mirror planes. But C3h is a different symmetry, with a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, let me think again. C3h consists of a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule must look the same when rotated 120 degrees and also when reflected across a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, triisopropyl borate: each isopropyl is attached to boron. If you imagine looking along the C3 axis (
