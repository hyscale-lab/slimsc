Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, I should probably recall what I know about particle physics and conservation laws. In annihilation processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Or wait, maybe it's that it's moving at non-relativistic speeds? Because if it's moving slowly, perhaps the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest energy, so we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics for the antiproton. But wait, the problem is about particle A's velocity, which might be relativistic.

Let me think about the setup. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Each has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, right? So the proton has mass m_p, and the antiproton has the same mass, m_p. So the total rest energy of the system before the collision is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

The products are two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Each A has mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. So four A particles in total. So the total rest energy of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Wait, that's less than 1876. So there must be a lot of kinetic energy in the products. But since the initial antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial kinetic energy is low, but the products have high kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the initial particles are moving towards each other. Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, perhaps it's in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Because if the antiproton is moving, then in the lab frame, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. The proton is stationary, so the total initial momentum is all from the antiproton.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate its momentum as much less than its rest mass times c. So maybe m_p v_antipr ≈ p_antipr. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so the total energy is roughly 2 m_p c². And the products must take away the energy and momentum.

Wait, but the annihilation process is p + p̄ → products. Since protons and antiprotons annihilate into other particles, here specifically into two A⁺ and two A⁻. So each A is a pair of particles with opposite charges, perhaps like pions, but with higher mass. But that's probably not important for the calculation.

So, the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum. Let's think in the center of mass frame. But wait, the problem is given in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, maybe it's better to analyze in the center of mass
