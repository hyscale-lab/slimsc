Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, and beta4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is about complex ion formation and using stability constants to find the distribution of species. The question is specifically about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) form. Wait, wait, but the options are about the blue complexes. I remember that in cobalt complexes, the color changes with the number of SCN- ligands attached. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is pink, and [Co(SCN)_2]^(n+) is blue. So the blue one is the dithiocyanato, meaning two SCN- ligands.

Stability constants, beta, represent the equilibrium between the metal ion and the ligand. So each beta corresponds to a stepwise formation constant for each ligand added. For example, beta1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ CoSCN^+, beta2 is for CoSCN^+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)2^0, and so on.

So the general approach here is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then find what percentage the dithiocyanato (two SCN) complex contributes.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which includes all species: the free Co^2+, the various complexes. And the thiocyanate is 0.1 M, which is quite high. So the formation of complexes should be significant.

The formula for the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants. The fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by (beta_n / (1 + sum of all beta_k * [SCN]^(k-n))) ) multiplied by [SCN]^n / [Co]^(total). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

I think the general formula for the fraction of a complex is:

f_n = ( [CoL^n] ) / ( [Co^2+] + [CoL] + [CoL2] + ... )

where L is the ligand.

Alternatively, we can model the log of the fractions using the stability constants and the ligand concentrations. But perhaps the easiest way is to compute for each possible complex the concentration, then sum all and find the percentage.

Wait, but the species can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ligands. Wait, no, the maximum ligands depend on the beta given. Wait, the betas go up to beta4=16, but that's beta4
