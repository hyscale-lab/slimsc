Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data given. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information and see what I can deduce.

The question mentions three techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's go through each one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H peak. Another possibility is a ketone, but no, the O-H is more like alcohols or maybe an acid. Also, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, what functional groups have peaks in those regions? 

The 1700 cm^-1 is a strong peak. That's typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower. For example, conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl like in a conjugated enone? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with substituents like a carbonyl group nearby.

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe in an alkene group. So perhaps the structure has a conjugated system. Like maybe an ester with a double bond nearby, or maybe a ketone with a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Okay, what fragments give 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight for several things. Let me think: C3H7O is 57, that's not it. Wait, 45—what's 45? Oh, maybe CH3COO- (the acetate ion is 45, but as a fragment, maybe a methyl ester group. Because if a molecule breaks off, like the acetate group, 45 comes from that. Alternatively, maybe something like a CH2O or COCH3? Hmm.

Let me think about the options given. The possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the options are varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygens.

Let me start with the FTIR. Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1—O-H. So the compound has at least one hydroxyl group, or maybe a carboxylic acid group. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong absorption, maybe even a broad peak. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad peak as well, but maybe not as strong. Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group in the IR (1700 and 1650) complicates things. So if there's a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone or something.

Wait, so if the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H, and then two carbonyl peaks, perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group? Or maybe a ketone and an alcohol? Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl and an alcohol.

Wait, but if the compound has two carbonyl groups, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe one carbonyl and some conjugation. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options, let's see what each formula could be. For example:

A) C6H12O2: degree of unsaturation. The formula is C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation: each double bond or ring is one, each triple bond is two
