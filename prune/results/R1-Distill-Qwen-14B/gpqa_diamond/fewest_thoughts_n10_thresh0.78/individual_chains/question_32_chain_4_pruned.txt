Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the collider when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li has an atomic number of 3. But if it has 3 neutrons, that would make the mass number A = 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6. Got it.

The speed of the nucleus is given as 0.96 times the speed of light (c). So v = 0.96c. I need to find the energy of the collider. I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy each nucleus has when it's moving at that speed.

Wait, but in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or maybe here it's just the kinetic energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, the problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." I think RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which would be their kinetic energy. But wait, when you're dealing with relativistic speeds, you have to consider the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So the total energy E = gamma * m c². But sometimes, the kinetic energy is E_kin = (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. So perhaps it's referring to the total energy each nucleus has when accelerated. Because the collider accelerates the ions to a high speed, so their total energy (gamma * m c²) is what matters.

So I need to compute gamma for v = 0.96c, then multiply by the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

First, find gamma. Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.57142857. Let me check with a calculator: 1 divided by 0.28. Let me compute 0.28 times 3.571. 0.28 *3.571 = approximately 1, right. So yes, gamma
