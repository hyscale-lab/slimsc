Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm. So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. The ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to the other 2 carbons to make a total of 8. Wait, the ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add two more, so the substituents are probably two groups each with one carbon, maybe? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons, but I'm not sure yet.

The IR has a carbonyl group, which suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something like that. But wait, the substituent could be a carbonyl-containing group. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so one of the substituents is a halogen, probably. Halogens like Cl, Br, I are common in aromatic compounds. So one substituent is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but how can the substituents add up to 2 carbons? If the ring is benzene (6 carbons), and the substituents are, say, a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let me think: the carbonyl group in a substituent could be part of a ketone, like R-CO-R', but if each substituent is a single atom, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone) and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, another approach: the compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2 more. So substituents could be a -CO-R group and a -X group. Wait, that might not add up. Let me clarify.

Wait, substituents like -X (like Cl) is one substituent, and another substituent could be a carbonyl group, but where? For

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene ring (which is 6 carbons) plus two substituents. But wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, if it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, each substituent adds some carbons. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total? Because 6 (from benzene) + 2 = 8. Oh, right, because the substituents are two groups attached to the benzene. So each substituent could be one or more carbons.

But wait, each substituent is probably a single group adding a certain number of carbons. Let's think about possible substituents. The IR data shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br attached to the ring). So the substituents on the benzene are probably a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but that would make it two substituents: one being a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and another being a halogen (like Cl, Br). So each substituent is a single atom, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl group is part of a larger substituent. For example, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl) on the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. Each substituent adds, say, one or more carbons. If the substituents are -CO- something and a -X group. Wait, let's think: the
