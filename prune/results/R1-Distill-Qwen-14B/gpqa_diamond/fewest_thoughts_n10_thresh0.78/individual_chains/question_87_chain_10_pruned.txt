Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene ring (which is 6 carbons) plus two substituents. But wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, if it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, each substituent adds some carbons. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total? Because 6 (from benzene) + 2 = 8. Oh, right, because the substituents are two groups attached to the benzene. So each substituent could be one or more carbons.

But wait, each substituent is probably a single group adding a certain number of carbons. Let's think about possible substituents. The IR data shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Cl, Br attached to the ring). So the substituents on the benzene are probably a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but that would make it two substituents: one being a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, etc.) and another being a halogen (like Cl, Br). So each substituent is a single atom, but wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl group is part of a larger substituent. For example, the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl) on the benzene ring.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. Each substituent adds, say, one or more carbons. If the substituents are -CO- something and a -X group. Wait, let's think: the
