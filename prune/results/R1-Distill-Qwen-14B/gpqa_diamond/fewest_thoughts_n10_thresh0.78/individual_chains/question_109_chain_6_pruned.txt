Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the sum of isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state be T + S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, no, the question says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). I think that might be a typo or maybe I'm misremembering. Oh wait, no, the note says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and J is total. So the term is defined as that.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So I need to find which partial wave is not permitted.

The options are A to D, each showing transitions where the initial state is 1S0, and the emitted particle X is in a certain state. The letters p, s, f, etc., denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number. For example, p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3, etc.

We need to use conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

First, parity considerations. The initial state is a 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L + 1), because for hydrogen-like atoms, the parity is (-1)^L * (-1) for 1s, but wait, wait. Let me think: for the hydrogen atom, the parity is (-1)^L. But wait, no: for the ground state (n=1) S states (l=0), the parity is positive. Because the parity operator gives Pψ(r) = ψ(−r). For the 1s orbital (l=0), the wavefunction is spherically symmetric, so parity is +1. For 2p, l=1, parity is (-1)^1 = -1, but wait, wait: the parity is actually (-1)^l * something? Let me get this right. The parity of a state is (−1)^{
