Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity is all about how well a species can donate electrons to an electrophilic center. The question is asking me to arrange a list of nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Let me see.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Wait, I think nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent. Since the question specifies aqueous solution, that's a polar protic solvent. In such solvents, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile, the more reactive it is. Also, the basicity might play a role because stronger bases are often better nucleophiles in such conditions.

Let me list each nucleophile and try to assess their nucleophilicity.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide, right? Alkoxides are strong bases and good nucleophiles. But steric hindrance can affect their reactivity. The 4-methyl substitution might make it a bit bulky, but cyclohexanol's conjugate base is still a strong nucleophile.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Another strong base. In aqueous solution, though, it's a good nucleophile. But since it's in a protic solvent, it's somewhat solvated, which might lower its reactivity compared to something less solvated.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base compared to hydroxide or alkoxides because it's resonance stabilized. So, in a protic solvent, it's less nucleophilic than something like OH- or the cyclohexoxide.

4. Methanol (CH3OH): Methanol is a neutral molecule, not a base. In an aqueous solution, it's a poor nucleophile because it's not a strong base and is not as good at donating electrons. Plus, it's not deprotonated here, so its lone pair isn't as available for attack.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS-): Wait, no, Ethanethiolate would be the thiolate ion, like CH3CH2S-. Thiols are generally weaker bases than alcohols, right? Wait no, wait. Wait, actually, thiols are more acidic than alcohols because the thiolate is stabilized by resonance with the sulfur. So, the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, while ethanol is around 16-19. So, the thiolate is a stronger base than, say, the propionate ion. But compared to hydroxide, which has a pKa around 15-16 for water, so hydroxide is a weaker base than thiolate? Wait, wait. Wait, let me clarify: the conjugate acid of the nucleophile determines its strength. Water's pKa is ~15.5, ethanol ~19, thiol (like ethanethiol) ~10. So, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. So, the thiolate (from a stronger acid) is a weaker base than hydroxide. Wait, no, wait: stronger acid means weaker conjugate base. So, since H2O has a higher pKa (~15.5) than ethanethiol (pKa ~10), H2O is a weaker acid than ethanethiol. That means OH- is a stronger base than HS-.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For conjugate acid-base pairs, the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. So, if ethanethiol has a lower pKa (stronger acid), its conjugate base (ethanethiolate) is weaker than hydroxide, which comes from a weaker acid (pKa ~15.5). So, the order of base strength would be
