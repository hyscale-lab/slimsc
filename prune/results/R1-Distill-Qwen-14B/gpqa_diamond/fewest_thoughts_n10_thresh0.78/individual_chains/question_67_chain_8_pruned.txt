Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. L and m are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component for the two-electron system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ for both. The options are A) 2/3, B)1, C)1/2, D)0.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to find the probability that when I measure L1z and L2z for each electron, both give -ħ. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that the orbital angular momentum quantum number l for an electron in a p orbital is 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, which matches the given state |1,1,2,-1>.

Now, the coupled angular momentum state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, the coupled state involves adding the individual angular momenta. So, each electron has l=1, and the total angular momentum L is 2. Because 1 + 1 = 2, which is the maximum possible here. The m value is -1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the individual m1 and m2 values, which are the eigenvalues of L1z and L2z?

I think the state |l1, l2, L, M> is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> would be a sum of all possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, which here is -1.

Wait, but wait, no. The coupled state |1,1,2, -1> is a specific state in the total angular momentum basis. To find the probabilities of the individual m1 and m2 values, I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>.

So the product states are |m1, m2>, which are eigenstates of L1z and L2z. The coupled state is a linear combination of these product states.

Wait, but how? I think the coupled states can be constructed using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l1, l2, L, M> is a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, of the CG coefficients times |m1> |m2>.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think. Each electron has l=1, so m1 and m2 can each be -1, 0, +1.

The total m is M = m1 + m2. In this case,
