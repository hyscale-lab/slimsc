Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it in the lab frame, it would be longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ would be γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Right, Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = E / m, because for a relativistic particle, energy E is approximately γm c². Wait, let me check the units. Oh, but here E is given in GeV and mass is in GeV/c². Wait, but the energy is given as 27 GeV. Hmm, but wait, the particle's rest mass is 3.41 GeV/c², right? So E is the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy? Or is E the total energy?

Wait, the problem states "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Oh, I think that refers to the total energy of the X⁰ particle. Because in particle physics, when they say the energy, they usually mean the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic.

So, E_total = 27 GeV. The rest mass energy is m c² = 3.41 GeV. So the gamma factor would be γ = E_total / (m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 * 7.9 ≈ 27. So around 7.9. Maybe more precise calculation: 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So γ ≈ 7.917.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.917 * 8 = 63.336, so τ ≈ 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, wait: 8e-16 multiplied by 8 (approximate γ of 8) gives 64e-16 s, which is 6.4e-15 s. Hmm, yeah, that seems right.

Now, the next part is about the minimum resolution needed. I think this refers to the detection resolution in the bubble chamber,
