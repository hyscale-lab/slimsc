Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² equals (32 divided by (4 - x² - y²)) times (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's written in terms of dx and dy. So the space is two-dimensional, maybe like a surface or something.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a tractricoid. But I'm not sure how that relates to the metric given here.

I remember that in differential geometry, the area element can be found from the metric. The area is the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the region. But wait, in two dimensions, the metric tensor is usually given in terms of coefficients, and the area element is sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the determinant. But since the metric here is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy².

Looking at the metric, the coefficient for both dx² and dy² is 32/(4 -x² - y²). So the determinant g would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait, no, wait. Wait, the metric tensor in 2D is usually written as g_{11} dx² + 2 g_{1
