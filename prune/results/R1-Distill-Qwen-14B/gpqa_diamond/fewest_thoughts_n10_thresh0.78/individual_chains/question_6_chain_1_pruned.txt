Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says: A particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). We need to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials can sometimes be expressed in a way that makes the problem separable into different coordinates. Like, in the hydrogen atom, we use spherical coordinates because of the spherical symmetry. But here, the potential depends on r and θ, so maybe the problem is using polar coordinates.

Wait, the potential is given in terms of r and theta. So perhaps we should switch to polar coordinates to analyze this. Let's see: V(r,θ) has two terms, (1/2)kr² and (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Wait, I can factor out the common terms. Let me write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that's an interesting form. So the potential depends on both r and θ, but maybe we can separate variables in the Schrödinger equation.

Wait, the total potential is (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's see if this can be written in terms of
