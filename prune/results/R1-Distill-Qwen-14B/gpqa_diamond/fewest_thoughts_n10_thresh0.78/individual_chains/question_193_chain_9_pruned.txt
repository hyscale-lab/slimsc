Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r?

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. 

Wait, but in this problem, N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, so perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars as a function of distance. Like, if you go a little bit further, how much does the number increase? That would be the derivative of N with respect to r (distance r), I think.

So N is proportional to r^5. So N = k * r^5, where k is some constant. Then, the derivative dN/dr would be 5k r^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Let me check. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5 and plx is proportional to 1/r, then 1/plx^5 is proportional to r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Then, the rate of change with distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with distance. The question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Oh, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem could be interpreted as N is proportional to r^5, meaning that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But if the question is about how the
