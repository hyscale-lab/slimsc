Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down. So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is, what radius would a hypothetical exoplanet need to have to produce the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount of light blocked depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (R_planet / R_star)^2, right? Because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, the star here has spots. So the brightness variation isn't just from the planet blocking the star, but from the spots being covered and uncovered. Oh, but the question says to find the radius of the planet that would produce the same amplitude signal as the star with spots. So we need to compare these two scenarios.

So, first, let's think about the star with spots. When the star rotates, the spots come into view. The dark spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, the star's total brightness decreases because those areas are not emitting as much light.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Wait, the filling factor is the area covered by spots on the hemisphere. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, maybe the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots, so the total spotted area is 0.2 times (half the star's surface) because the star is a sphere, but only one hemisphere is spotty.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire star. The filling factor is 20%, so spots cover 20% of the star's surface. Oh wait, no. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere (Northern and Southern, but in this case, only one is spotty) has 20% of its area covered by spots. Since each hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total spotted area is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the star is observed from Earth, and only one hemisphere is spotty. So the spots are on one side, which we can see. The other side is spot-free. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the maximum brightness change occurs when the spots are either fully visible or fully hidden. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, but we observe only one hemisphere at a time. So as the star rotates, the spotted side moves into and out of view. So the total area of spots on the hemisphere is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2*(π R^2)/2, since the hemisphere's area is (π R^2 / 2). So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (π R²/2) = 0.1 π R².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4π R², so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) (since only one hemisphere is spotty, which is 2π R² in area). Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So for the hemisphere, the area is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total area covered is 0.4 π R².

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so Rstar is R_sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R^2. So 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the total area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

But wait, each spot is cooler by 1000K. The star's Teff is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K. So each spot emits less flux. So when the spots are facing us, the total flux from the star decreases because those areas are emitting less.

So the change in brightness when the star rotates can be calculated by the difference in flux when the spots are visible versus when they're not. Hmm, but actually, the spots are always on one side, but as the star rotates, the spotted part comes into view. So the maximum change in brightness is when the spots are fully visible and when they're fully hidden. Wait no, assuming that the star's rotation brings the spots into and out of view. So the maximum dip in brightness is when the spots are fully in front, and the maximum brightness is when the spotless side is facing us.

Wait, but the problem states that the star is observed from Earth, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star is rotating, the spotted side comes into view, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of the brightness variation is due to the spots' area and their lower temperature.

But I'm trying to find how this dip compares to a planet transit. So the dip from the spots would be similar to a planet blocking the same amount of flux, but perhaps the temperature affects the flux calculation.

Wait, the star emits flux F = sigma * Teff^4. But the spots have lower temperature, so their flux per unit area is sigma*(Teff - delta T)^4. So the total flux from the star without spots is F_total = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R².

When a spot is present, the flux is F_total - F_spots + F_spot_area_at_T_spot.

Wait, no. The star's total flux when spots are present is F = F_normal - (spot_area) * sigma (Teff)^4 + (spot_area) sigma (Teff - delta T)^4. So the change in flux is delta F = - spot_area sigma (Teff^4 - (Teff - delta T)^4).

But wait, when the star without spots emits F = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R². When spots are present, the flux is F = F_total - (area of spots) sigma (Teff^4) + (area of spots) sigma (T_spot^4).

So the flux change is delta F = (area of spots) sigma (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4).

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K. So delta F is negative because the spots emit less. But when they are on the side facing us, the flux from the star is lower.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation. So the maximum dip in brightness is when the spots are fully visible, i.e., the spot area is blocking (or emitting less) the maximum amount.

Wait, but when the star is rotating, the spots transition from being on the far side (so their effect is zero) to being fully on the near side (so their effect is maximum). So the change in flux is the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about it more carefully.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * T_eff^4 * 4 pi R².

When the spots are on the near side, the flux is F = F0 - (flux lost due to spots).

But the flux lost is the area of the spots multiplied by (sigma T_eff^4 - sigma T_spot^4). Because without spots, that area would emit T_eff^4, but with spots it's T_spot^4.

So the flux when spots are visible is F = F0 - (A_spots) * sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

The change in flux is delta F = - A_spots sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).

The relative change in flux is delta F / F0 = [ - A_spots sigma (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi R² ].

Simplify this: delta F / F0 = [ - A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ T_eff^4 * 4 pi R² ].

But I think the amplitude is the absolute value of this change. So the maximum dip is |delta F| / F0.

But wait, the problem states that the star's photometric variation resembles that of an exoplanet. So when the planet transits, it blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2. But in the case of the spots, the dip is not a uniform blocking but a temperature-dependent dip.

So to find the equivalent planet radius, we need to set the maximum dip from the spots equal to the dip from the planet.

Let me denote A_p = (R_p / R_star)^2.

The dip from the planet is A_p.

The dip from the spots is delta F / F0 = [ A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ T_eff^4 * 4 pi R² ].

Wait, actually, A_spots is (area of spots) / (total area of star). Because when the planet transits, it blocks (R_p^2 / R_star^2) of the area, hence the same fraction of flux.

But the spots don't block the flux; they just reduce it. So the dip is not the same as the planet blocking. Hmm, this complicates things. Because the planet blocks a certain amount of flux, whereas the spots lower the flux due to their lower emission.

Wait, the problem says that the situation (star with spots) can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the photometric time-series would show a dip when the spots are on the near side, similar to a planet blocking part of the star. But the dip's amplitude would depend on the effective area and the temperature difference.

So, to find the equivalent planet radius, we need to equate the dip in brightness caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots.

The dip from the planet is when the planet blocks part of the star's light. So the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2.

The dip from the spots is when the spots are fully visible. So the dip is the maximum difference in flux when the spots are on the near side versus when they're not.

So the dip from spots is:

delta F_spot = [ A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R² T_eff^4 )

Wait, let me compute it:

delta F = [ A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (4 pi R² T_eff^4 )

Because F0 = sigma T_eff^4 4 pi R², so 1/F0 = 1/(sigma 4 pi R² T_eff^4 ).

Wait no, delta F is [A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] * sigma, and F0 is sigma T_eff^4 4 pi R². So delta F / F0 = [ A_spots (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ T_eff^4 4 pi R² ].

But A_spots is the area of the spots divided by the total area of the star. Wait, no: A_spots is the area of the spots, which is (filling factor) * (area of hemisphere). Because the spots are on one hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So A_spots = 0.2 * (2 pi R²) ) = 0.4 pi R².

Wait, the star's total area is 4 pi R². So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1 or 10%. So A_spots_fraction = 0.1.

Wait, so A_spots (in the formula) is the area of the spots, which is 0.4 pi R². So when we compute delta F / F0, it's [ (0.4 pi R² ) * (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [ (4 pi R²) * (6000^4) ) ]

Simplify that:

= [0.4 (6^4 -5^4) ] / [4 * 6^4 ]

Wait, let's compute 6^4 and 5^4.

6^4 is 6*6=36; 36*6=216; 216*6=1296. So 6^4 = 1296.

5^4 is 5*5=25; 25*5=125; 125*5=625.

So 6^4 -5^4 = 1296 -625 = 671.

So numerator is 0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 4 * 1296 = 5184.

So delta F / F0 = 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.05168, which is about 5.17% dip.

Wait, but wait I think I made a mistake. Because when the spots are on the far side, their effect is zero, and when on the near side, the dip is maximum. So the dip is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, no. Actually, the star's flux when spots are on the near side is F = F0 - (A_spots) sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4). So the change is delta F = - A_spots sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4). So the relative change is delta F / F0 = [ A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ F0 ].

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to compute it numerically.

Compute the dip from the spots:

A_spots = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K.

So, the flux from the spots when they are on the near side is F_spot = A_spots * sigma T_spot^4.

The flux from the star without spots would be F0_spot = A_spots * sigma Teff^4.

So the dip is F0_spot - F_spot = A_spots sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

The total flux from the entire star is F0 = 4 pi R² sigma Teff^4.

So the relative dip is (A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4 pi R² Teff^4) ) = (0.4 pi R²) (6000^4 -5000^4) / (4 pi R² (6000^4) )

The R² and pi terms cancel:

= (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 )

We already found that 6000^4 -5000^4 is 671, so:

= (0.4 *671) / (4 * 1296) ) = (268.4) / (5184) ≈ 0.0517 or ~5.17% dip.

So the dip from the spots is about 5.17%.

Now, for the planet transit: the dip is (R_p / R_star)^2. We set this equal to 0.0517.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.0517 → R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227. Wait, but that's about 0.227, which isn't one of the options. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait. The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K, which is a 1000 K difference.

Compute (6000^4 - 5000^4) = 1296 * 1e12 (since 6^4 is 1296, and 5^4 is 625) → 1296 -625 = 671. So 671 units.

A_spots is 0.4 pi R².

So delta F / F0 = (0.4 pi R² * 671) / (4 pi R² * 1296) )

Ah, wait, the 4 pi R² is from F0 = 4 pi R² sigma Teff^4.

So [0.4 pi R² * 671] / [4 pi R² * 1296] ] = (0.4 * 671) / (4 * 1296)

0.4 is 2/5; 671 *2 =1342; 1342 / (5 *4 *1296) ) → 1342 / (20 *1296) → 1342 / 25920 ≈ 0.0517, same as before.

So that's correct.

So the dip from the spots is about 5.17% of the star's total flux. So the equivalent planet would have to block 5.17% of the star's light, which corresponds to (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.0517.

Taking square root: R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227, which is approximately 0.23.

But none of the options are close to 0.23. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in calculating the spot area?

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 times the hemisphere's area.

Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R². Which is correct.

So the fraction of the star's total area covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1, 10%.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view as a maximum of 10% of the star's surface. So the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible is 10% of the area times the difference in flux per unit area.

Wait, but the dip isn't 10% of the flux, because the spots are cooler.

So perhaps the dip is 10% times (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, but let me re-calculate the dip.

The dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) / Teff^4.

Wait, (A_spots / A_star) is 0.1.

(Teff^4 - T_spot^4)/Teff^4 = (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = (1296 -625)/1296 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.5177.

So the dip is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177 or 5.177%, which is what I had before.

So the dip from the spots is about 5.177% of the total flux.

So a planet would need to have (R_p / Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p = Rstar * sqrt(0.05177) ≈ Rstar * 0.227.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the star is not covered by spots, the dip is the same as the planet. Wait, the question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!) what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the star without spots would have a light curve where a planet transiting would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. But in the spotted case, the dip is similar. So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 equal to the dip amplitude from the spots.

But in the current scenario, the star is spotted, and the dip is 5.17%. So the planet would need to cause the same dip, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp = Rstar * 0.227.

But none of the options are ~0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness when the spots rotate into view, treating it as an equivalent area that is darker, and that the brightness change is the same as an area being blocked.

Wait, maybe the brightness dip from the spots is the same as the planet's area. So the dip from the spots is (A_spots / A_star) * (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4).

Wait, no. Because when the spots are visible, the flux is lower by the amount that the spots are cooler. So the dip in flux is (A_spots / A_star) * [1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)].

Hmm, so the dip is (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

So instead of subtracting the higher flux, it's the difference in fluxes.

So let's compute that.

(A_spots / A_star) = 0.1.

(T_spot / T_eff)^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So dip is 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, same as before.

So the same result.

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the maximum dip is only when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. Since the star's rotation period brings the spots into view and then out of view, the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible.

Wait, but our calculation already accounted for the entire spotted area (A_spots = 0.4 pi R²). So that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't include 0.23. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, 0.23 is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the filling factor.

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So perhaps the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere. So A_spots is 0.2 * 4 pi R² / 2 = 0.4 pi R². Which is what I did earlier. So that seems correct.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the star's rotation period makes the spots appear as a certain size, but that probably doesn't affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the temperature difference but just the area. Wait, but that would give a much smaller dip.

Wait, if the spots were the same temperature as the star, the dip would be zero. So the temperature difference is crucial here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the brightness change as the difference between when the spots are on the far side and near side.

Wait, when the spots are on the far side, their effect is zero. When they're on the near side, the flux is lower by the amount calculated. So the dip is the same as the change in flux when the spots rotate into view.

So I think the calculation is correct.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options, none is around 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (6000/5000)^4. Let me recompute that.

Wait, (6000/5000) is 1.2.

1.2^4 = 1.2 *1.2 =1.44; 1.44 *1.2=1.728; 1.728 *1.2=2.0736. So 6000^4 /5000^4 = 2.0736.

Wait, so T_eff^4 = 6000^4, T_spot^4=5000^4.

So (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) = 6000^4 (1 - (5000/6000)^4) ) = 6000^4 (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 6000^4 (1 - 0.482253) ) = 6000^4 * 0.517747.

But when we compute the dip, it's (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4)).

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (0.482253)) = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.051775.

Which is still about 5.1775% dip.

So how do we get to an Rp of around 0.11 or 0.32?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip as if the brightness change is the same as a planet blocking the same area, but considering that the spots are cooler, not completely blocking.

Wait, but the planet would block the light completely, whereas the spots just reduce the flux. So the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but the dip from the spots is (A_spots / A_star) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4).

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that the star has an effective temperature, and when spots are present, the observed flux is lower, but the planet would completely block that area. So the dip from the planet is (Rp^2/Rstar^2), and the dip from the spots is the same as (A_spots * (1 - (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )) ) / (A_star).

Which is what the calculation is.

So the dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = dip from spots.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Rp = sqrt(0.05177) * Rstar ≈ 0.227 Rstar.

Again, same result.

Hmm, so none of the options match. I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on a single hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots only cover a portion of the star's disk as seen from Earth. So the area of the spots visible at any time depends on the rotational phase.

Wait, but the maximum dip occurs when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is when the entire 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots. So the calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the effective area as the area of the hemisphere, not the entire star. Let me think differently.

Wait, the brightness dip could be considered as the area of the spots on the hemisphere (which is 20% of the hemisphere) times the flux difference. But perhaps I'm mixing up the areas.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the entire star, but the hemisphere.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum area covered when the entire hemisphere is facing us is 2 pi R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

So the fraction of the star's disk covered by spots is (0.4 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) )= 0.1, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the dip when the spots are on the limb, but I think that complicates things more and probably doesn't change the result.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem states that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler, meaning 5000 K. But perhaps when the star is observed, the flux from the spots is lower, but when a planet transits, it blocks the same amount of flux regardless of where on the star it's blocking. So the dip from the planet is when the entire blocked area is at 6000 K, whereas the spots cause a dip that's lower.

Wait, but that's exactly what the calculation is doing. So I don't see a mistake here.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake was in the initial assumption. Perhaps the star's radius is the same as the Sun, but the planet's radius is to be found in terms of the star's radius. So if the dip from the spots is 5.17%, the planet must block 5.17% of the star's light, which would require a radius of sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.227 Rstar. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of 6000^4 and 5000^4.

Wait, 6000 is 6 * 10^3, so 6000^4 = (6^4) * (10^3)^4) = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 = (5^4) * (1e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/ (6000^4) = 0.671e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.5177.

So dip is (0.1) * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177.

Which is 5.177% dip.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's flux from spots is only when they're on the near side. So the photometric variation would be when the spots are moving into and out of view. So the dip from the spots would be 0.05177, but the planet would have a larger dip.

Wait, no, because the question says that the photometric variations from the spots would resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude (dip) is the same.

So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But the options do include 0.11. Let me compute 0.11^2 = 0.0121, which is about 1.21% dip. That's much lower than 5.17%.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should not factor in the temperature. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is treating the spots as simply a 20% filling factor on the hemisphere, so the dip is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but the hemisphere's area is half the star's surface. So 20% of the hemisphere is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface.

But that would make the dip 10% if the spots were at the same temperature. But since they are cooler, the dip is more, as calculated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the temperature difference and just use the area. If that's the case, then the dip would be 10% of the star's surface. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1 → Rp = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316, which is close to option D) ~0.32.

But the problem does mention a temperature difference, so that approach would ignore that.

But the options include 0.32, which is option D. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, but why would the temperature not matter? Because the problem states that the spots are cooler, which would produce a larger dip than just the area. So I'm confused.

Wait, I'm going to re-read the question.

The question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)."

Ah, wait! The key here is that the star is not covered by spots. So, if the star wasn't spotted, what would the planet's radius need to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased is a bit different. It says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star.

Wait, no, the question is: the star is currently spotted, leading to brightness variations. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude in the light curve if the star wasn't spotted.

Wait, no. Let me parse the sentence again.

"To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!) what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star."

Ah, so without spots, the planet would cause the same dip as the spots cause when they're present.

So the dip from the spots (with a 10% area, 5.17% dip) is the same as the dip from the planet (Rp^2).

So the planet's dip is Rp^2 = 0.0517 → Rp = ~0.227 Rstar.

But none of the options match, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is considering only the area of the hemisphere. So when the star isn't spotted, the planet transiting would block an area of Rp^2, which would cause a dip of Rp^2. The spotted star's dip is 0.2 (filling factor) * (1 - (T_spot^4 / T_eff^4 )) → 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035. So the dip is about 10.35%.

Wait, that would make the dip larger. So setting Rp^2 = 0.1035 → Rp ~ 0.3218, which is about 0.32, which is option D.

Hmm, but why would the filling factor be 20% of the hemisphere, not 20% of the entire star.

Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. Hemisphere area is 2 pi R². So spots area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

Which is 0.1 of the entire star's surface. So dip is (0.1) * 0.5177 ≈ 5.177%.

But if I instead consider the filling factor as 20% of the entire star, then A_spots = 0.2 *4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R². So dip would be (0.2) * (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, which is 10.35% dip. Then Rp^2 =0.1035 → Rp≈0.3218 → option D.

But that contradicts the problem statement, which says the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended approach was to use 20% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, and Rp=0.32, option D.

But the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, with a 20% filling factor. So the spots are 20% of that hemisphere, not the entire star.

But perhaps the problem is intended to have you ignore the temperature difference and just use the area. Then dip is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / (star area) ) = 0.2 * (2 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1. So dip =0.1, so Rp= sqrt(0.1)= ~0.316, option D.

But why would the temperature not matter? The problem does state a temperature difference, but perhaps it's a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effective area as the hemisphere. So the dip is 20% of the hemisphere. The total area of the star is 4 pi R², but if the hemisphere is 2 pi R², then the dip is (0.2 * 2 pi R² ) / (2 pi R²) ) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the maximum area covered is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2*(2 pi R²) ) = 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of the entire star.

So dip is 10% * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 10% * 0.5177 ≈ 5.177% dip.

So Rp^2 = 0.05177 → Rp=0.227.

But no option is close. But option B is 0.07, which is sqrt(0.0049)=0.07. So that would correspond to a dip of 0.49%.

Wait, perhaps I confused the filling factor. Maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

If the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, then the area is 0.2 *4 pi R²/2 (since only one hemisphere is spotty). Wait, no, filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So only 10% of the star's surface is covered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip as the spots, considering that when the star is not spotted, the planet would block an area that is cooler, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is treated as an equivalent area, so the dip is 20% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere's area is half the star's surface. So dip is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1. So dip is 10%, so Rp^2 =0.1 → Rp=0.316, option D.

But that ignores the temperature difference. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots' area is 20% of the hemisphere, so the effective area is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) ) = 0.4 pi R². So the area fraction is 0.4 pi R² / (4 pi R²) ) = 0.1.

So dip is 0.1, so Rp^2=0.1 → Rp=0.316, option D.

But then the temperature difference is ignored. But the problem mentions a temperature difference, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the filling factor to be 20% of the entire star, not the hemisphere.

If that's the case, then dip would be 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, so Rp= sqrt(0.1035)=~0.3218, option D.

But the problem states that the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

Hmm. I think the intended approach is to ignore the temperature difference and just use the area, leading to Rp=0.32. So the correct answer is D.

But I'm not entirely confident because the problem mentions the temperature difference, which should affect the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the planet to cause the same maximum dip as the spots, but the spots' dip is over a larger area, so the effective area is considered as the sum of the spots, leading to a larger dip, requiring a larger planet.

But I'm getting stuck here. Given the options, and the calculations, I think the intended answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the problem as follows:

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K (i.e., 5000 K). The goal is to find the exoplanet radius \( R_p \) such that the brightness variation caused by the planet would match the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Spot Area and Filling Factor**:
   - The filling factor of 20% refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The hemisphere's area is \( 2\pi R^2 \), so the area of the spots is:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R^2 = 0.4\pi R^2
     \]
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is:
     \[
     \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.1
     \]
     Thus, 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The brightness variation caused by the spots depends on the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star. The flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \), so the flux difference per unit area is:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{per unit area}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
     where \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). Calculating:
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
     \[
     1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4} \approx 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177
     \]
   - The relative brightness variation due to the spots is:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} \times \left(1 - \frac{T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}\right) = 0.1 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.05177 \, (5.177\%)
     \]

3. **Equivalent Exoplanet Radius**:
   - The brightness variation caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
     \]
   - Setting the dip caused by the planet equal to the dip caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.05177
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.227
     \]

4. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( R_p / R_{\text{star}} \approx 0.227 \) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star (not just one hemisphere), the area covered by spots would be:
     \[
     A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times 4\pi R^2 = 0.8\pi R^2
     \]
     The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots would then be:
     \[
     \frac{A_{\text{spots}}}{A_{\text{star}}} = \frac{0.8\pi R^2}{4\pi R^2} = 0.2
     \]
     The dip would then be:
     \[
     \text{Dip} = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.1035 \, (10.35\%)
     \]
     Setting this equal to the planet's dip:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
     \]
     This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the filling factor applies to the entire star, not just one hemisphere. Under this assumption, the radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal is approximately **0.32** times the radius of the host star.
