Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through. Alright, the setup: there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which I remember is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. They have a spaceship that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast—close to the speed of light.

The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. The question is about how long the trip will take from the astronaut's point of view. Wait, right, because of time dilation, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be less than the time measured by someone on Earth or in a stationary frame.

So, the first thing I need to figure out is the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, do I know that? I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it around 160,000? Or wait, I might have mixed it up with the Andromeda galaxy. Let me check my memory. Oh right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Or wait, did I get that wrong? Or is it another number? Hmm. I think it's about 163,000 light-years. So, distance D is roughly 160,000 light-years.

The speed of the spaceship is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is v. So, from Earth's frame, the time taken would be D divided by v. But wait, from the astronaut's perspective, the time is different because of time dilation.

Wait, let me clarify. The proper time (tau) experienced by the astronaut is given by the time dilation formula. The formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth (rest) frame, and v is the speed of the spaceship.

So first, calculate t (Earth's frame time). t = D / v. Since D is 160,000 light-years and v is 0.99999987c, let's compute that.

Wait a second, let's think in terms
