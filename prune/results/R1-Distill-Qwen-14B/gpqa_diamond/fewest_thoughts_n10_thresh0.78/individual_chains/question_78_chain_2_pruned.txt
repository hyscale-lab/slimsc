Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point and time when a point charge q is moving along a trajectory. The setup involves the charge moving with velocity v at the time tr, which is earlier than the observation time t. The point where the field is generated is connected to the observation point by the vector d, and we're to find expressions for V and A.

I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are related to the fields through Maxwell's equations. Specifically, the scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

Wait, so for a moving charge, how do these potentials look? I think the potentials are not just static anymore because the charge is moving, so there must be some sort of dynamic terms.

Let me recall the expressions for potentials due to a moving charge. Oh right, when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B.

The general form for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t)/c²)] , but wait, maybe not exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps there's a term involving the velocity of the charge.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of retarded time. Oh right, when calculating potentials for moving charges, we use the retarded time to account for the finite speed of the fields. But wait, the problem states that t > tr, so the retarded time is at tr. Hmm.

Wait, the charge moves, so from the perspective of the field at time t, the charge was at a different position at time tr = t - (distance)/c. So the distance between the charge's position then and the observation point is d, which is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

So the potentials are functions of tr. Let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential V is given by the static Coulomb potential, but adjusted by the motion. Wait, no, the scalar potential in the presence of motion should include a term that corrects for the velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(d + (v × something))]. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that the vector potential for a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * something, perhaps over the same denominator as the scalar potential.

Wait, maybe I should write down the general expressions. The scalar potential V due to a point charge moving with velocity v at the retarded time is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(d + (v tr)/c²)], but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (q/(4πε₀)) [1/(r - (v (t - tr)))] but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard expressions. The scalar potential from a moving charge is:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1/( |r - r'| ) ] evaluated at the retarded time, where r' is the position of the charge at time tr.

But given that d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, d = r - r'(tr). So the denominator would be |d|.

Wait, but that's just the static case. When the charge is moving, perhaps the denominator has a term involving the velocity.

Ah, right! The correct expression for the scalar potential includes a term that accounts for the motion. I think the denominator is (d c + v × d) or something like that. Wait, more accurately, the denominator
