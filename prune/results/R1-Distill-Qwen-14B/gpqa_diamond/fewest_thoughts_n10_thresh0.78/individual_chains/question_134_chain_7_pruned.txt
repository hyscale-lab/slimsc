Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, wait. Oh right, neutralization reactions typically involve an acid reacting with a base. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually measured per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved, I think. But wait, sometimes it's per mole of acid or base, depending on the situation. But in this case, since there are multiple acids and a base, I need to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- involved.

Let me jot down the reactions. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too but it's diprotic—so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since Ba is +2, the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So, let's calculate the moles of each substance.

Starting with HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. And since HCl is H+ and Cl^- each, moles of H+ from HCl is 0.1.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So OH- moles are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait a second, now I have the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.
Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, the H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So I need to find out which is the limiting reactant.

So, the H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles.

OH- is less, so it's the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles.

So the neutralization reaction will produce water. The total moles of H+ that react is 0.2, and OH- is 0.2. So the enthalpy change depends on the amount of H+ and OH- that actually neutralize.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. Oh, right. So the total enthalpy change would be based on how much H+ and OH- reacted.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait—since we're mixing two solutions, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid but in solution, the second deprotonation (the second H+) might not be as strong. Or does it matter here? Well, for the purpose of stoichiometry, I think I just need to count the moles of H+ and OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. So the ΔH is negative.

So, the total moles of H+ available is 0.28. OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and 0.0
