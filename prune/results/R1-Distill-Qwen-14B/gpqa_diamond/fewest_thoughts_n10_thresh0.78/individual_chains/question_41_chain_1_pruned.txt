Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when you have moving media, you have to consider relative velocities, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Alright, the problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about the concepts involved here.

First, the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, if the glass is stationary, the light would be moving at c/n relative to the glass. But if the glass itself is moving, I suppose we need to use some sort of velocity addition, like from special relativity or classical mechanics.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. But does this problem require relativistic considerations? Hmm, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v. So if v is not too close to the speed of light, maybe we can use the classical velocity addition formula. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, but the speed of light in the medium is c/n, which is less than c. So when you have a medium moving at velocity v, the speed of light in the medium relative to the lab frame is... Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the frame of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light beam depends on both the light's speed in the glass and the glass's movement.

If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be (c/n) + v? But wait, is that even correct in this context?

Wait, no, because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So when the glass is moving at
