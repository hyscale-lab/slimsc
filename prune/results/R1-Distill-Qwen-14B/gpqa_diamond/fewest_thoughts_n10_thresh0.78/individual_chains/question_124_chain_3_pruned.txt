Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and detectors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector, and some new particles are produced. These new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector, and the radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Wait, so the original situation is that one third reach the walls. We need to find the Lorentz factor that increases this fraction to two-thirds. I'm a bit confused about how the Lorentz factor affects the particles' ability to reach the inner walls. Oh right, the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate. But how does that tie into the particles moving and decaying?

I remember that particles that decay quickly might not travel far if their lifetime is too short. Oh, right! The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is tau. The lab frame (detector's frame) would see a longer lifetime because of time dilation. The lifetime in the lab frame would be gamma * tau. So if the lifetime is longer, the particles can travel further before decaying.

The problem says the detector's radius is 30 meters. So the particles have to travel 30 meters to reach the inner walls. The distance they can travel before decaying is related to their speed and lifetime. If their lifetime is longer, they have more time to travel, so more of them would reach the detector walls.

In the initial case, with gamma =20, only one third reach the walls. Let's think about the fraction of particles that reach the walls. That probably depends on the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it would take to reach the wall.

So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since the speed is ultra-relativistic, we can approximate it as the speed of light, c. So t = R / c, where R is 30 meters. Wait, but in the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is P = (1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)) ). Wait, no, actually, the probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is P_decay = 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it hasn't decayed, which is the probability it reaches the wall, would be exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, I've heard about the relation between the mean lifetime and the decay length. The decay length L is c * gamma tau. Because the average lifetime is gamma tau, so the distance the particle travels before decaying is c multiplied by that. So if L is greater than the detector's radius R, then a significant number of particles will reach the wall. The fraction that makes it would be related to the ratio of R to L.

Wait, because the decay follows an exponential distribution. The fraction that hasn't decay
