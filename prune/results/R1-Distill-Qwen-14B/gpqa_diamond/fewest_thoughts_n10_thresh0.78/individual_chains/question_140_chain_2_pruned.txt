Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it as best as I can.

The question starts by introducing Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, so X is a compound or element with an isotope that's heavier than the usual. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Oh, wait, that's an interesting clue. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. That's about 3 degrees Celsius, right? So B is probably a solid at room temperature but just above freezing.

Another clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two oxygen atoms. That might mean that X is something that reacts with acids, perhaps like a carbonate or something else. Wait, but the product has two oxygens. Maybe the keto acid is something like a carboxylic acid, and X is an alkali metal? Or maybe it's a base.

Additionally, Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm. Common reagents in organic chemistry include things like Grignard reagents, which are organometallic. Or maybe something like THF? Wait, THF is a solvent, though. Wait, Grignard reagents are R-Mg-X, where X is halide. So maybe X is Mg? Because magnesium is used in Grignard reagents, and they're used in organic chemistry. Alternatively, maybe it's something like lithium (Li), which is used in organolithium compounds.

Wait, but let's go back to the reaction. X reacts with liquid Y violently. Let's think about possible reactions. If X is a metal, Y might be an acid, like H2SO4 or HCl. But the reaction releases gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think: which gas could that be? Gas W's molecule has equal neutrons and protons. What about H2O? No, because H2O's molecule has 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So the total would be 2*(1p,0n) + (8p,8n) = 10 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. So H2O doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility is NH3. Each molecule of NH3 has 14 protons (1 from each H and 14-14? Wait, no. Let me think: N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So in NH3:
