Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. They want to know how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or olefin cross metathesis. So when an alkene reacts with Grubbs, it can undergo either ring-closing or some kind of exchange.

Wait, but the starting material here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons. Pent has five carbons. Numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that can't be right because pent-1-ene would have five carbons with the double bond at the first position
