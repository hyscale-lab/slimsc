Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So that's probably an alcohol (from O-H in an -OH group) or maybe a carboxylic acid (which has a very broad O-H stretch). But wait, there are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is typical of carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 might be a conjugated double bond, like in a C=O that's part of a conjugated system or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be an amide or another type of carbonyl, but since the options don't have nitrogen, maybe it's just a conjugated carbonyl.

So, combining the IR data, we have a compound with O-H (likely from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl group. The presence of a broad peak suggests that it's an alcohol because carboxylic acids have even broader and more intense O-H stretches, but maybe in this case, the peak is broad enough for an alcohol. Alternatively, if it's a ketone or an ester, but without the broad O-H, but wait, wait. Wait, the FTIR also has a broad peak, which points to an O-H. So, it's more likely that the compound has an O-H group, like an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

But wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is more likely an ester or ketone. For example, a ketone's C=O is around 1700-1750. Esters also have C=O around 1700-1750. If it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would lower the wavenumber a bit, hence the 1650 might be the conjugated C=O. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an O-H group, meaning it's something like an ester with an alcohol? Or perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol. Wait, but that would require more oxygen atoms.

Looking at the options, the possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

If the compound has an O-H and a carbonyl group, like an ester, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms. For example, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R', so the formula would include two oxygen atoms. So looking at the options, the possible candidates with two oxygen atoms are A (C6
