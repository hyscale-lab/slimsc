Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has been identified, and it's made up of five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the changes in the gene sequence.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Hmm, I think that would mean the gene isn't functional anymore. So, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably a loss-of-function mutation.

Looking at the options, they give the intact gene and four mutants (1 to 4). Each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, which is the first exon area. Since exons are coding regions, any mutation there could affect the protein product.

Let's break down each mutant:

The intact gene is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking for differences. Comparing to the intact, the third and fourth nucleotides in the first part: the intact has TT, mutant 1 has CT. So, the change is from TT to CT. Wait, let me check the exact positions.

Wait, the sequences are given in 5' to 3' direction. Let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. So, in the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. For Mutant 1, the sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Hmm, so the first few nucleotides differ. Let me compare each position:

Intact: positions 1-20 (hypothetically)
M1: Position 4-6: TTT → TCT? Or wait, perhaps looking at the exact letters.

Wait, the intact sequence starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGG
