Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. Oh right, fission usually releases a lot of energy because the binding energy is being released.

So the two fragments: one is twice as massive as the other. Wait, but their combined rest mass is 99% of M. Oh, because some mass is converted into energy during the fission process. Right, mass defect—E=mc², so some mass turns into kinetic energy and other forms.

Let me jot down the given info:

- Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: let's say masses m and 2m.
- Sum of their rest masses: m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So M = (3m)/0.99. Hmm, but maybe I should express everything in terms of M.

Wait, actually, let me think in terms of the mass ratios. The initial mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So the total mass after fission is less than before, which is due to the energy released.

The problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. But we need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. So the question is asking about how much the classical approximation differs from the actual relativistic value.

First, perhaps I should find the velocities of the two fragments. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m2 = 2 m1. Because one is twice as massive as the other.

Wait, wait. The problem says the more massive fragment is twice as massive. So m1 is the less massive, m2 = 2 m1.

So m1 + m2 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M → m1 = 0.99 M /3.
