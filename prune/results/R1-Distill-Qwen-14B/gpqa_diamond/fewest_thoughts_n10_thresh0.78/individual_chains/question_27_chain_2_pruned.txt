Okay, so I've got this question about a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain meeting. Hmm, I remember that ribonucleoproteins are involved in various cellular processes. The question is about where they met and where the chain is going.

Wait, the ribonucleoprotein says, "Pause there for a minute. Let me show you in; you really need some sugar." Oh! Sugar makes me think of something related to adding carbohydrate groups. I remember that after a protein is made, it might undergo glycosylation, which is the addition of sugars. Glycosylation typically happens in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

So the nascent chain is probably a protein being synthesized. Ribosomes make proteins, right? Oh, but wait, the question says it's a ribonucleoprotein particle. Oh, ribosomes are made of rRNA and proteins, so that fits. So the ribonucleoprotein is the ribosome. So they meet on the ribosome.

The nascent chain is the growing protein chain being made by the ribosome. The ribosome is attached to the rough ER when the protein is destined for secretion or for membranes. So the chain is being sent into the ER. But the question is about where they meet and where the chain is heading.

If the ribonucleoprotein is the ribosome, the meeting place is the ribosome. Then, the chain is heading to the ER. But wait, the options don't have ER as a destination.

Looking at the options: Option A is cytosol to extracellular, which would be via the ER and Golgi. Option B is ribosome to proteasome. Proteasome is where proteins are degraded, but the conversation here seems more about processing, not degradation. Option C is membrane to nucleus. That doesn't fit. Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, when the ribosome is attached to the ER, the nascent chain goes into the ER. Once the chain is in the ER, it's modified, perhaps with sugar groups. Then, from ER to Golgi via vesicles. So the initial meeting is on the ribosome at the ER. The chain is heading towards the ER, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is being sent to the Golgi.

Wait, the question says where did they meet and where is the chain
