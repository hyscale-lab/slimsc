Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question says. 

A chemist found a white solid, and they have some spectral data to identify it. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to use the mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR data to determine which structure is correct.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32% relative intensity. Hmm, so the molecular formula must have an even molecular weight since the molecular ion is even (156). Wait, but 158 is two more. That could suggest a possible addition of something like Cl, but wait, Cl has an odd mass. Oh wait, maybe it's the molecular ion plus something else. Wait, but chlorine has a mass of about 35, which is odd. Wait, no, wait, let me think. Oh wait, the molecular ion is at 156. The next peak is at 158, which is 2 higher. Maybe it's an isotope? Like, Cl has a common isotope at 35 (75%) and 37 (25%). So if the molecular ion is 156, and the next is 158, that's +2, which would be a chlorine isotope. So the molecular formula would include a Cl atom. Because the molecular ion at m/z 156 is the major one, and 158 is 32%, which aligns with the 25% abundance of Cl-37. Because Cl is 35 (75%) and 37 (25%), but wait the main peak is 156, which would be if the molecule has a Cl-35 (so 35, which is odd), but the molecular weight is even. Wait, 156 is even. So maybe the molecular formula has even number of Cl atoms? No, wait, one Cl would make the molecular weight odd if the rest are even. Hmm, but 156 is even. So perhaps the molecular formula is C8H5ClO2? Because 8 carbons: 8*12=96, 5 H is 5, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Adding up: 96+5=101, +35.5=136.5, +32=168.5. Wait, that's way over. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H5O2Cl. Let's check the molecular weight: C is 12*8=96, H is 5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. 96 +5=101, 101+35.5=136.5, 136.5+32=168.5. But wait, the molecular ion is 156. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's see: 7*12=84, 5 H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. That's about 156.5, which rounds to 156. So that makes sense. So molecular formula C7H5ClO2. So the M is 156.

Now, the IR data. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad peak, which probably indicates an OH stretch. Because O-H stretches in alcohols or carboxylic acids are broad. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. Wait, but aldehydes have a peak around 1720 as well. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but if it's deprotonated or something, maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or acid chloride would have a higher carbonyl peak. Wait, also, the presence of a broad peak suggests maybe -COOH (carboxylic acid), which has both O-H (broad) and C=O (around 1700).

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. That's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a triplet or something. Wait, but 11 ppm is more like a carboxylic acid -OH proton. Oh wait, but the -OH in carboxylic acid is usually broad, but in the NMR here, it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe it's an aldehyde. Because aldehyde protons are around 9-10, but sometimes higher. Wait, 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, it could be an exchange process if it's an -OH, but the integration is 1H. So if that's a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Hmm.

Next, 8.02 ppm, doublet, 2
