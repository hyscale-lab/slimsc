Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But let's take it step by step. The question says that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, I should look at the spectroscopic data provided for compound X. The IR and NMR will give me clues about the structure.

Looking at the IR data: 
- The peaks between 3400–2500 cm-1 probably indicate an -OH group, maybe in a carboxylic acid since those have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300. But wait, another possibility is an alcohol or maybe an alkyne, but I think the strong peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. The other IR peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings—maybe C=C stretching.

So, putting that together, compound X might have an aromatic ring (like benzene) and a carboxylic acid group attached. Also, the O-H stretch in IR would support that.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong singlet, probably the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. The broad signal makes sense because O-H protons are usually broad due to hydrogen bonding.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, two protons as a doublet (each integrating to 2H) in the 8.0 region, and another two in the 7.2 region. That suggests a substituent on the benzene ring, maybe a methyl group or another substituent in the para position.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a methine (CH) group attached to something else. Maybe near an oxygen or an aromatic ring.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps another CH2 group, maybe adjacent to a CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of protons, maybe a methyl group attached to something else, like a CH2 or a CH group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. Maybe the end of an ethyl group.

Putting that together, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at one position and an ethyl group in another position. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the aromatic protons are two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para substitution. So if the substituents are in the para positions, let's say positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.

If one substituent is a carboxylic acid (since we have the IR and NMR signals for that), then another substituent is probably an alkyl group. Let's see the other NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so maybe that's a (CH2CH(CH3)) group or something like that.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure. If I have a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent in the para position, which is a branched chain.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm as a doublet for 3H suggests it's attached to a CH, perhaps as a -CH(CH3)- group. And the 1.7 ppm
