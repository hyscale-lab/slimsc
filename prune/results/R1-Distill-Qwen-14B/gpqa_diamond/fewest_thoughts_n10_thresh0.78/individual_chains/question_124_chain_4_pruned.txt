Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Hmm, Lorentz factor... right, the Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But in this case, I'm not directly given v; instead, I need to relate the fraction of particles reaching the detector to their Lorentz factors.

Wait, so the particles are produced at the center of the detector, right? So the maximum distance they can travel before decaying is related to their lifetime and velocity. Oh, right! Because the particles decay quickly, their lifetime is a factor. The ones that reach the detector walls must have a lifetime long enough for them to travel the radius of the detector before decaying.

But wait, the problem says that at a Lorentz factor of ~20, on average, one third reach the walls. We need to find the factor needed so that two-thirds reach. So maybe this has to do with the proper lifetime and the observed lifetime due to time dilation.

The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. The observed lifetime (from the lab frame) would be γ * τ. So the distance a particle travels before decaying is v * γ τ. 

Wait, but the detector's radius is 30 meters. So the particles that reach the wall must have v * γ τ >= 30 meters. Or wait, no, because the particles might have varying paths. But since they're produced at the center, the maximum distance they can go is 30 meters. So the condition for reaching the wall is that the particle's speed multiplied by its lifetime (in lab frame) is equal to 30 m. 

So, v * γ τ = 30 m. Because the maximum distance they can go is 30 m.

But wait, the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on their velocity. Because some particles might have a higher velocity and thus a
