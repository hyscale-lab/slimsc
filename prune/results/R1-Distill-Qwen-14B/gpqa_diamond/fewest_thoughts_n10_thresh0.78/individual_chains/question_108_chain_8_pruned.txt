Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 T. We're comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether the coupling term is much larger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

Wait, I remember that paramagnetism in atoms is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is usually given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment and B is the magnetic field. But wait, the magnetic moment μ is related to the angular momentum, right? Oh right, μ = gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin quantum number.

Wait, but the orbital magnetic quantum number m is mentioned here. Oh, but wait, the orbital contribution to magnetic moment is different. The orbital contribution is μ_orbital = μ_orbital = (μ_B m) / (something), but I'm more familiar with electrons having spin magnetic moments, which are spin-½ particles. Oh, but in this problem, since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, maybe we're considering the orbital contribution? Or perhaps it's the spin? Hmm, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term," which I think refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but wait no, paramagnetism usually comes from the spin, not the orbital motion. Hmm. Or wait, paramagnetism is due to the electron's spin magnetic moment interacting with the external field. So the paramagnetic term would be proportional to the spin magnetic quantum number m_s, which can be ±1/2.

Wait, but the question says "small values of m," which I thought was the orbital m. Oh, if m is small, like 0 or ±1, then the orbital
