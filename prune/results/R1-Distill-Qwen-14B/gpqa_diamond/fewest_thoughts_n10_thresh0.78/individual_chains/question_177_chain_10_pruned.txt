Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The problem is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass that's 1.5 times larger. But wait, the question is about their luminosities. Oh, right, but the problem says they found the wavelengths where each star appears brightest are the same. Hmm, that probably relates to their temperatures. Also, their radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s respectively, but I'm not sure how that factors in yet.

The astronomers computed the luminosities assuming they're black bodies. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since σ is a constant, it might cancel out when comparing the two stars.

So, the first step is probably to find the temperatures of each star. The wavelength at which a black body emits most strongly (peak emission) is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). Since the problem says the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be inversely proportional. So if λ_max is the same for both, T1 = T2. Because λ_max_1 = λ_max_2, so T1 = T2. Wait, no, wait: Wien's law is λ_max * T = constant, so if λ_max is same, then T must be same. Oh, so both stars have the same temperature. That's a key point.

Wait, but wait! The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! The observed wavelength could be different from the rest wavelength. So the λ they measured is the observed one. So the actual emission peak (rest frame) is different? Or is the emission peak in their own rest frame... Hmm,
