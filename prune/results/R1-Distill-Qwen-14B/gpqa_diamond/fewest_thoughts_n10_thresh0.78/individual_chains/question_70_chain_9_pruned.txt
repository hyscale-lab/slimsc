Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions leading to the formation of product E, and then we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

First, I'll try to break down each reaction given. 

So, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents make me think that B is a diatomic molecule because reacting in a high stoichiometric ratio often points to elements combining in specific ways. For example, maybe B is O2, because 8 equivalents would mean 4 molecules of O2 reacting with one A. Wait, but 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. So the reaction could be something like A + 4 B → C. Wait, but if B is diatomic like O2, then 8 equivalents would be 4 moles of O2. So perhaps A is something that combines with O2 in a 1:4 ratio.

Wait, but another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is sulfur? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide or something else. Hmm, but the product C is bright red. Bright red solids are often things like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) which is reddish. Or maybe lead dioxide (PbO2) which is dark brown but... Wait, or maybe it's a compound containing sulfide ions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound. 

Wait, another approach: Let's think about reaction three. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak. So perhaps C is a salt that, when it reacts with water, undergoes hydrolysis to produce two different acids.

Wait, like if C is something like a sulfite or sulfate? But let's think about the possible acids. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, HClO4, etc. Weak acids could be like H2S, H2CO3, or something else.

Wait,
