Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when it reacts with a strong acid, it should produce a salt and water. The problem gives the mass of Fe(OH)3 as 0.1 grams and the total volume as 100 cm³. They're asking for two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a volume and pH.

First, I think I need to write the chemical equation for the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O

Wait, but maybe I should balance it. Let's see, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So when it reacts with a strong acid, each OH- will react with H+ to form water. So the balanced equation would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

So, for every mole of Fe(OH)3, three moles of H+ are needed.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

The mass given is 0.1 grams. So moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 (since 106.85 is roughly 107, 0.1/107 is about 0.0009346).

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the H+ required is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid available is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L. To find the volume needed to get 0.002808 moles:

Volume (L) = moles / Molarity = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me see the options. Option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, maybe I should check my calculations again.

Wait, let me compute 0.1 / 106.85 more accurately. 106.85 times 0.000936. Let's calculate 0.1 / 106.85.

106.85 * 0.000936 = 0.1?

Wait, 0.000936 * 106.85 = 0.0936 * 1.0685 ≈ 0.0936 * 1 = 0.0936, but that's not the right approach. Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.1 / 106.85 exactly.

106.85 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 g is 0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.000936 mol.

So 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3 * 3 = 0.002808 mol H+ needed.

H+ comes from the strong acid, which is 0.1 M. So the volume V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is
