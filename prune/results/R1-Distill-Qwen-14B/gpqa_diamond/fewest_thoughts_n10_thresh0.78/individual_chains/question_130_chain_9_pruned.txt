Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about redshift and detecting clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical telescopes. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. 

Wait, the problem mentions Lyman alpha absorption at about 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line of hydrogen. In the rest frame of the hydrogen, it's at around 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms. But when the hydrogen is moving away from us due to cosmological redshift, this wavelength gets longer.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these clouds can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So what's the deal with optical telescopes? Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers, so about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength in the observed frame must fall within the optical range for us to detect it. So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be less than 7000 Angstroms because anything longer would be in infrared, which optical telescopes can't see as effectively, right?

Wait, wait. Because redshift z makes the wavelength longer. The formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So we need λ_obs <= 7000 Angstroms because beyond that, it's infrared, which optical telescopes can't detect well.

The rest wavelength λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms. So:

1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000

Let me solve for z. 

(1 + z) <= 7000 / 1216

Calculating that: 7000 divided by 1216. Let me compute that. 1216 times 5 is 6080, 1216 times 5.7 is let's see, 5*1216=6080, 0.7*1216=851.2; 6080+851.2=6931.2. Hmm, 5.7 gives us about 6931.2. But we have 7000, which is 68.8 more. So 5.7 plus (68.8/1216) ≈ 5.7 + 0.0566 = approximately 5.7566.

So 1 + z <= ~5.7566 → z <= ~4.7566. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I got it backwards.

Wait, no, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that the clouds can be detected. So the clouds must have a redshift such that when their Lyman alpha is redshifted, it's still in the optical range. So the higher the redshift, the more the wavelength stretches, moving into longer (infrared) wavelengths. But optical telescopes can't see beyond ~70
