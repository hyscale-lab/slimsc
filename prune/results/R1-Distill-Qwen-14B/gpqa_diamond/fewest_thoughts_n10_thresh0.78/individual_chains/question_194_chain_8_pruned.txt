Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question is about three spins S1, S2, S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Beta is 1/(kT) as given. So for each state, I calculate the exponential of beta times the energy, and sum them all.

But wait, how many states are there? Each spin has two options, so 2^3=8 possible states. Oh right, each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

The energy expression is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me expand that. So each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1. But since all the terms are multiplied by J and negative, the energy depends on how many of these pairs are aligned or anti-aligned.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute E for each possible state. Or perhaps find the number of states with a certain number of aligned pairs and calculate the energy for each case.

Alternatively, think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote that sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.

So for each state, H can be 3, 1, or -3? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The sum H can vary. Each term is either +1 or -1. So for three terms, sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), or -3 (all -1). Or wait, let's count:

Wait, no, H can also be 1, -1, or other values. Let me compute all possibilities. Hmm, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations.

Each spin is either +1 or -1. So for each of the three pairs, S1S2 can be +1 or -1. Same for the other pairs.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think about how many pairs are aligned. Because each aligned pair (S_i and S_j same) contributes +1, anti-aligned contributes -1. So the sum H is the number of aligned pairs minus the number of anti-aligned pairs. But since there are three pairs, if n is the number of aligned pairs, then H = n - (3 - n) ) = 2n -3.

So possible values of n (number of aligned pairs) are 0,1,2,3.

So for n=0, H = 2*0 -3 = -3 → E = -J*(-3) = 3J.

n=1 → H= 2*1 -3= -1 → E= J.

n=2 → H= 2*2-3=1 → E= -J.

n=3 → H= 3 → E= -3J.

Wait, but let me check: H = sum of S_i S_j. So each S_i S_j is 1 if they are aligned, -1 if anti-aligned. So sum H can be 3 (all aligned), 1 (two aligned, one anti-aligned), -1 (two anti-aligned, one aligned), or -3 (all anti-aligned).

Wait, no: if all three are aligned, each term is +1, so sum is 3. If two are aligned and one anti, sum is +1+1-1=1. If two are anti, sum is -1-1 +1 = -1. If all anti-aligned, sum is -3.

So the possible H values are 3,1,-1,-3.

Wait, but that doesn't match n=3, n=2, etc. Wait, when n=3, all three pairs are aligned, H=3. When n=2, two pairs aligned, one anti: H= 2*(+1) +1*(-1) → 2-1=1. When n=1, two anti and one aligned: sum is (-1)*2 +1*1= -2+1= -1. When n=0, all three pairs anti-aligned: sum is -3.

So, H can be 3,1,-1,-3.

Then E = -J H. So for H=3, E = -3J. For H=1, E = -J. For H=-1, E= J. For H=-3, E=3J.

So for each H, I can find the number of states that produce that H, and then compute
