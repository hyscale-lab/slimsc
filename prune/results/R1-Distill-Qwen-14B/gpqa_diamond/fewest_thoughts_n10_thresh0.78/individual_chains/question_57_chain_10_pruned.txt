Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves particles colliding and bouncing off without losing energy. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on phase shifts, but I think they relate to the scattering angles and the amplitude.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess that means higher-order terms beyond δ₄ aren't considered. All right, so I need to use these to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. The formula for the imaginary part of f(1/2, l, m) or something like that. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f is calculated using the sum over l of (something involving the phase shifts). 

The general formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is f(θ) = 4π/(k) * Σ ( (2l+1) / (2k) ) * [ sin(δ_l) ] / (1 - cosθ) ) * e^{iδ_l} }, but wait, I'm a bit mixed up. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part might be given by another formula.

Wait, another approach: I recall that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1) / (2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) ) / (1 - cosθ) ) because the imaginary part comes from the sine of twice the phase shift, maybe? Or wait, no, perhaps the imaginary part of f is given by 4π/(k) times the sum of ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2 (1 - cosθ)) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) ) / ( (1 - cosθ
