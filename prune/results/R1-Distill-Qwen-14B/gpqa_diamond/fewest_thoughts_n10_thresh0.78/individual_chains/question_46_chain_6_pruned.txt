Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these Grubbs catalyst reactions. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium based, that facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. Metathesis means the redistribution of substituents between two double bonds. So, the molecule undergoes a ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe just a cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene... let me draw its structure. Pentene has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Let me number the chain. Position 1 is the first carbon. So, 3-methyl would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let's think
