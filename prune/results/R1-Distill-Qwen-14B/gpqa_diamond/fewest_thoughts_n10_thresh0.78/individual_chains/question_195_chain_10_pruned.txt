Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Now, the question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. This second planet should exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm, I remember that transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star, maybe causing an increase in brightness as the planet's light is blocked or not visible anymore. But I'm not entirely sure about occultationâ€”maybe it's when the planet is hidden by the star, so we see a drop in the total light because the planet's brightness is blocked. Either way, for both events to happen, the second planet's orbit must be such that it can sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind it (occultation). But wait, in our solar system, Mercury and Venus transit the Sun, but planets with longer orbital periods don't. So that's probably due to orbital mechanics.

Wait, but for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet's path around the star (ecliptic) is edge-on to us. So both planets are in the same orbital plane, as per the question. So, the key factor here is the orbital periods of the two planets. For the second planet to both transit and occultate, it must orbit the star in such a way that sometimes it's in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But if the orbital period is longer, does that allow for that? Or is it about the relative positions and their orbital periods?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. The two planets are orbiting the same star, the first with a period of 3 days. The second one has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The question is about the maximum possible period of the second planet such that both planets transit and occultate each other. Or wait, no, the question says the second planet
