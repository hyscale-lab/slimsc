Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, both with the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction, which causes the magnetic moment to oscillate. The frequency of this precession is related to the Larmor frequency, right?

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to Sz, which for a spin-1/2 particle has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 (but wait, actually, the spin component is gamma times Sz, so maybe I should think in terms of energy levels?).

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. The energy levels in a magnetic field are given by the Zeeman effect: E = -mu · B. So if B is along +Z, the energy levels are E = -gamma * B * m_s * ħ? Or wait, perhaps more accurately, the energy is proportional to S_z. So E = -gamma * B * (S_z), but I'm a bit confused about the exact expression.

Wait, actually, the magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times the spin angular momentum, so mu = gamma * S. The energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is E = -mu · B. So when B is along the z-direction, E = -gamma B S_z. So the energy levels are E = ± (gamma B ħ / 2), since S_z for spin-1/2 is ± ħ/2.

But wait, when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the system's Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, so when the field is along Z, the state is |+> or |->. Then, the field is turned off, which I think means the system is no longer subject to that magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, the field is turned on along Y. So after that, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. So H = -gamma S_y B (since mu = gamma S; S is spin operator).

Wait, no, wait. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so in the new field along Y, the energy is E = - mu · B = -gamma B S_y. So H = -gamma B S_y. The Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y.

In quantum mechanics, the time evolution of a state under a Hamiltonian is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. If the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, say |+z> or |−z>, then when the Hamiltonian becomes H = ω S_y, where ω is some frequency, the state
