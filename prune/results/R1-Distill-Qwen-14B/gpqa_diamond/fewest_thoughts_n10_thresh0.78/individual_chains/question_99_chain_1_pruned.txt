Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's see, the question gives me information from FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. I'll start by breaking down each piece of data and connecting them to the possible structures.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is very broad because of hydrogen bonding. So that must mean the compound is a carboxylic acid. The other strong peak is at 1700 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That fits with a carboxylic acid since they have a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. It says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are in double bonds, so this compound doesn't have any double bonds. All the structures given are carboxylic acids with branching, so I don't need to worry about double bonds here.

The NMR shows several signals, but two specific ones are of interest. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each splitting comes from neighboring protons.

Let's look at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So the structure is something like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The central carbons (the two C(H)(C2H5)) each have two CH groups attached. Wait, the CH2 group next to the COOH would have two protons, but the central parts are more complex.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Here, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a CH group connected to a C2H5 group and another substituent.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
This would be (CH3)2C-C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Each of the central carbons has two CH3 groups attached, and the next group is CH2.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each central carbon has a CH3 and a CH2CH3 attached, and the next group is COOH.

Wait, all the options are di-substituted at the two central carbons. Now, the NMR signals. Let's think about each structure
