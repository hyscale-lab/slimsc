Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying an aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that means the ring has two substituents attached. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters usually have a carbonyl group, which absorbs around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So I remember that in IR, a strong peak in that region confirms an ester.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's break down the signals:

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Di-substituted rings can have different substitution patterns. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be two sets: two equivalent protons ortho to each substituent and two equivalent para. Wait, no, more accurately, in a para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The protons on the ring would be two sets: the two ortho to substituents, and the two meta, or maybe only the ortho and para protons? Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene, the substituents are opposite, so the ring protons would be two sets: the two adjacent (ortho) to each substituent and the two opposite (para) to each substituent. But wait, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two types of protons: the two ortho to substituent A and the two ortho to substituent B. Wait, or maybe there are only two types of aromatic protons because each substituent is in a position that the remaining protons are equivalent? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two distinct aromatic proton environments.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are in positions that split the ring into two distinct environments. For example, if the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, no, in meta substitution, the ring would have three sets of protons. Or maybe in para substitution, the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think: in para substitution, the substituent is on carbon 1 and another on carbon 3? No, wait, para is across, so substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Then the ring would have protons at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to substituent 1; positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to substituent 4. So the substituents are at 1 and 4. So protons at 2 and 6 would be one set, and protons at 3 and 5 another. So in the NMR, two signals for aromatic-H, each integrating for two protons. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the case of two substituents in para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each set with two protons. So yeah, two signals in NMR for aromatic-H.

Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, maybe part of an ester group. Ester groups have an adjacent CH2 group sometimes, but wait, the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So the ester might be part of a substituent that's attached to the ring.

In an ester group, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. If the ester is part of a vinyl group, like maybe an acrylate ester or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester attached to a vinyl group. Hmm.

The two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about coupling in vinyl groups. For example, in a trans double bond, each vinyl proton would couple with
