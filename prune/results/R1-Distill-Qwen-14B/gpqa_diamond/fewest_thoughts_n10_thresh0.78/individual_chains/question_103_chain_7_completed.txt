Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. Let me start by breaking down what the target molecule is.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a phenyl group with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. The substituents are bromo and nitro groups, and the ethanone is attached where? Oh wait, ethan-1-one means the ketone is on the first carbon of ethane, which is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone (COCH3) group, a nitro (NO2) group, and a bromine (Br) substituent. Let me draw this mentally: the ring has a COCH3 group at position 1, a nitro at position 3, and bromine at position 5? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the substituents are at 3 and 5, they are meta to each other, but wait, that can't be. Wait, no, if the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, that would mean they are adjacent? Wait, no, benzene is numbered such that position 1 is one point, then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So positions 3 and 5 are actually across from each other? Wait, wait, no. Let's think: position 1 is where the ketone is, then position 3 is two positions away, and position 5 is four positions away. Wait, actually, in benzene, positions 1, 3, 5 are alternate positions. So the substituents would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. Wait, the structure is 3-bromo-5-nitro, so the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, which are across from each other? No, wait, 3 is adjacent to 1, and 5 is adjacent to 4. Wait, maybe I should visualize this as a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So positions 3 and 5 are both adjacent to position 1? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward to think of the benzene ring with the ketone in position 1, nitro in 3, bromo in 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to position 1. So the ring substituents are at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and 1 (COCH3). So, the ketone is at 1, so the substituents are at 3 and 5, which are adjacent to each other? No, wait, 3 and 5 are separated by two carbons. Wait, perhaps I should imagine the benzene ring like this: position 1 is the COCH3. Then going clockwise, position 2, position 3 (Br), position 4, position 5 (NO2), position 6. So Br is at 3, NO2 at 5. That would mean the substituents are on positions 3 and 5, which are across from each other? No, because 3 and 5 are two positions away from each other. Wait, so benzene being a six-membered ring, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 3 and 5 are two positions apart. So they are meta to each other. Wait, no. Meta is when substituents are separated by two carbons, which would make them at positions 1 and 3, for example. So in this case, 3 and 5 are two positions apart, so they are meta. So the substituents (Br and NO2) are in the meta positions relative to each other, and both are attached to the benzene ring which also has the ketone group.

The question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene to make this compound. Benzene is pretty simple, but we need to add these substituents in the correct order. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

I remember that when adding substituents to a benzene ring, the order in which you add them matters because directing effects come into play. Strong activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are strong activating, but nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. Bromine is ortho/para-directing but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (since it's a halide, but wait, actually, bromine is ortho/para directing but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing by inductive effect, but activating by resonance? No, wait, halogens are unique. They are deactivating overall but ortho/para directors because of resonance effects. So when a substituent is added, it can influence where the next substituent adds.

So in our target molecule, the ring has Br, NO2, and COCH3 groups. Let's think about the directing effects.

The COCH3 group is a ketone, which is a meta-directing, deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (the carbonyl is EWG). The nitro group is also meta-directing and deactivating. The bromine is ortho/para-directing but deactivating.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the directing effect depends on their positions and their activating/deactivating nature. So the order of addition is key because each substituent added affects where the next will go.

So the target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. Let's figure out the order in which they should be added to get them in the correct positions.

Looking at the target, the ketone (COCH3) is at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So perhaps the ketone is added first, then Br and NO2 are added in positions that are meta and para or something.

Wait, but wait. The ketone is a meta director. So if we add it first, the next substitution would be at meta positions relative to it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone. Or another sequence. Let's think about each step.

Looking at the options, each option is a series of reactions, some of which involve substituents like Br, NO2, ketone, etc.

The key steps would involve introducing the nitro group, bromine, and the ketone group.

Wait, the starting material is benzene. Let's think about each substituent.

Option 1: Let's think about the nitration. Nitration is done with HNO3 and H2SO4. So if the first step is nitration, that would add a nitro group. Then maybe bromination, then adding the ketone.

Wait, but the ketone is a substituent that is usually introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups because the catalyst (AlCl3) is involved in the reaction. If the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work. So the ketone group cannot be introduced after nitro groups or bromine because those are deactivating. Therefore, the ketone must be introduced early in the synthesis, before adding deactivating groups.

Alternatively, if the ketone is introduced first, then the ring is activated for substitution, but then the next substituents would be directed by the ketone.

Wait, but let's think about the steps:

If I start with benzene, then first do Friedel-Crafts acylation to get acetophenone (1-phenylethan-1-one). So that's COCH3 attached to benzene. Then, the ring has an activating group (the ketone is actually deactivating, as it's a meta director). Wait, no, the ketone is deactivating (because it's EWG), so the ring is deactivating and meta-directing.

So after adding the ketone, the next substitution would be at the meta position relative to ketone. So if I then nitrate, the nitro group would go to the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, when I brominate, would it go to another position? Wait, but the bromine would be ortho/para to the existing substituents.

Wait, let me think again. The target has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone at position 1. So if I add nitro at position 3, then bromine would go to position 5? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and bromine need to be added in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan the synthesis.

We need to have COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

So, the ketone is first. Then, let's add the nitro group at position 3 (meta to ketone) and bromine at position 5 (also meta to ketone, but wait, if ketone is at 1, position 3 is meta, but position 5 is two carbons away again. Wait, perhaps I should number the ring with the ketone at position 1, and then the next substituents are added in the correct positions.

Wait, maybe let's plan the steps:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (ketone at position 1).

2. Next, nitration. The acetophenone is meta-directing, so the nitro group will go into the meta position relative to the ketone. So position 3 or 5? Well, in benzene, the meta positions are positions 3 and 5 when the ketone is at 1.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric. So, adding nitro group at position 3 would be the same as position 5 in terms of the resulting structure, because of the symmetry. Hmm, but the target has substituents at 3 and 5, so perhaps after adding the ketone and nitro, then adding bromine.

Wait, but the problem is that after nitration, the ring now has two groups: ketone (deactivating, meta) and nitro (deactivating, meta). So adding bromine would be tricky because both are deactivating. Bromine is a substituent that is ortho/para-directing but deactivating. So, where would bromine go?

Wait, perhaps the order is: add the ketone first, then nitro, then bromine.

But wait, let me think about the directing effects. After the ketone is added, when we nitrate, the nitro group goes meta to the ketone. So, that's position 3 or 5. Let's say it goes to position 3. Then, when adding bromine, the existing substituents are ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). The nitro is meta, so it's a strong deactivator and meta director. The bromine would be directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but let's think about the possible positions. After adding ketone (1) and nitro (3), the next substitution would be bromine. The existing groups are at 1 and 3. So for bromine's position, which substituents are directing?

The ketone is at 1. It's meta-directing. The nitro is at 3, which is meta to 1. Nitro is meta-directing. So, if adding bromine, where would it go? The bromine would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, with two substituents, the directing can be a bit tricky. But in this case, the ring has ketone (position 1) and nitro (position 3). So the ketone is at 1, nitro at 3. Now, the next substituent (bromine) will be directed by these groups.

The ketone is meta-directing, so from position 1, the next possible positions for substitution would be 4 and 6 (meta to 1). The nitro is at 3, which is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming substituents to positions 6 and 2 (since nitro is at 3, meta would be positions 6 and 2). Wait, but position 2 is adjacent to 1, which is where the ketone is.

But wait, the ring now has substituents at 1 and 3. So when adding the bromine at step three, where does it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromine. Let's think of a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Let's say benzene is nitrated, then brominated, and then the ketone is added. But wait, adding the ketone via Friedel-Crafts would require the ring to be activated, but nitro is a deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible. So that can't be the case.

So, the ketone must be added before the nitro and bromine groups. Because once the nitro or bromine (which are deactivating) are added, the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

So, the first step is to introduce the ketone. So, step 1 is Friedel-Crafts acylation (using CH3COCl and AlCl3) to get acetophenone.

After that, the ring has the ketone, which is meta-directing. Then, we can add the nitro group. So step 2 is nitration. The nitro group would add meta to the ketone, either at position 3 or 5. Let's say at position 3.

Now, the ring has ketone at 1, nitro at 3. The next step is bromination. Bromination with FeBr3 is an electrophilic substitution. The ring now has two substituents: ketone (meta director) and nitro (meta director). So, bromine will be directed by these groups.

But where would the bromine go? Let's think about the possible positions. The ketone is at 1, nitro at 3. So, the available positions are 2,4,5,6. But nitro is at 3, which would direct incoming groups to positions 6 and 2 (as it's a meta director). The ketone at 1 would direct to positions 4 and 6 (since meta is two positions away, so 1+3=4, 1-3= -2 → 4? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the ketone at 1 directs incoming groups to positions 3 and 5. But position 3 is already occupied by nitro. So, the next group would go to position 5? But wait, position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the available positions. After ketone at 1 and nitro at 3, the available positions are 2,4,5,6. Now, the nitro group at 3 directs meta, which would be positions 6 and 2. The ketone at 1 directs meta, which is positions 3 (occupied) and 5. So, in this case, which substituent has a stronger directing effect?

Nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone. So, maybe the nitro group would dominate the directing. So, when adding bromine, it would go to position 2 or 6, which are meta to nitro.

But the target has bromine at position 5. Hmm, that's conflicting. Because that would require bromine to be at position 5, which isn't a meta position relative to either the ketone or the nitro.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of addition.

Alternative approach: perhaps the bromine is added before the nitro group. Let's see. So step 1: benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1). Step 2: bromination. Bromine is ortho/para to the ketone. So, bromine would add at position 2 or 4 or 6? Wait, the ketone is meta-directing. So, bromine would go to position 4 and 6 (since the ketone is at 1, meta is 4). So, position 4 would be meta to 1. Alternatively, considering that the ketone directs meta, but bromine is ortho/para director. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The substituent's directing effect depends on its own nature. So, after the ketone is added (step 1), the ring is meta-directing. So, when we add bromine (step 2), the bromine would be directed to the meta position relative to the ketone, i.e., position 4. But wait, bromine is added via electrophilic substitution. So, the directing group is the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent determines where the next group comes in. So, in Friedel-Crafts acylation, the ketone is a meta-directing group. So, when adding bromine after that, bromine would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 4. Then, the next step is nitration.

After bromine is at position 4, the ketone is at 1. So, when we nitrate, the nitro group would be directed by the ketone (meta) and the bromine (ortho/para). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group and bromine after the ketone. Let's think about which substituents would allow the correct positions.

Wait, the target requires bromine at 3 and nitro at 5. So, if the ketone is at 1, then bromine is at 3 (meta to ketone), and nitro is at 5 (meta to ketone). But how can both substituents be added in the correct positions?

Wait, perhaps first add the ketone, then nitro at 3 (meta), then bromine at 5 (another meta position). But wait, after adding nitro, the ring has two substituents: ketone (1) and nitro (3). Now, when adding bromine, the ring is deactivating, so it's harder to perform substitution. Also, the directing effects would come from both groups.

The ketone is at 1, which is meta-directing. Nitro is at 3, which is meta-directing. So the available positions for bromine would be positions 5 and 6?

Wait, the ketone at 1 would direct to positions 3 (occupied) and 5. The nitro at 3 would direct to 6 and 2. So, position 5 is a meta position from the ketone, and position 6 is meta from the nitro. If both groups are present, which position is favored? It depends on the activating/deactivating nature.

Wait, nitro is a stronger deactivating group than the ketone. So, the nitro group may dominate the directing. So, the bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 2. But our target has bromine at position 5, which isn't a meta position for either substituent. Hmm, perhaps that approach isn't working.

Another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced after bromine and nitro. But that can't be because the ketone's introduction via Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, which can't happen if the ring has nitro or bromine (which deactivates it).

Alternatively, maybe the bromine is added before the nitro group. Let's see.

Step 1: benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (1).

Step 2: bromination → bromine at position 4 (meta to ketone).

Now, the ring has ketone at 1 and bromine at 4.

Step 3: nitration. Where would the nitro group go?

The ketone is at 1 (meta director). Bromine at 4 is ortho/para director. So, the nitro group could be directed by either.

The ketone would direct to position 5 (meta to ketone at 1), and bromine at 4 would direct to positions 3 and 5 (ortho and para). So, both substituents may direct to position 5. So, the nitro group would add at position 5.

So, the resulting structure would have ketone at 1, bromine at 4, nitro at 5. But in the target, the bromine is at 3, nitro at 5. So, that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the order is different.

Another plan: Add the ketone, then bromine, then nitro.

Wait, but after adding bromine, the ring has a deactivating group (Br is deactivating), but the ketone is also deactivating. So, nitrating after that would be difficult because the ring is very deactivated.

So, perhaps the steps are: ketone, then nitro, then bromine.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is highly deactivated, so adding bromine may not be efficient. But perhaps it's possible.

So, step 1: benzene → ketone (1).

Step 2: nitration → nitro at 3.

Step 3: bromination. Now, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3). Where does bromine go?

The ketone (1) is meta-directing, so meta would be positions 3 (occupied) and 5.

The nitro (3) is meta-directing, so meta would be positions 6 and 2.

So, possible positions for bromine are 2,5,6.

But in the target, bromine is at 3 (but that's occupied by nitro). Wait, that can't be. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe the bromine is added before the nitro group.

So, step 1: benzene → ketone (1).

Step 2: bromination → Br at 4.

Step 3: nitration.

Now, in step 3, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (4). So, where would the nitro group go?

The ketone at 1 is meta-directing, so directs to 3 and 5.

The Br at 4 is ortho/para-directing. So, Br directs to 3 (ortho to 4), 5 (para to 4), and 2 (ortho to 4).

So, possible positions for nitro: 3,5,2.

If nitro adds at position 3, that would be ortho to Br (position 4), which is adjacent. So, positions 3 and 5 are possible.

If nitro adds at 3: then the structure has 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 4 (Br). But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Alternatively, if nitro adds at 5: so, in step 3, nitro goes to 5, which is meta to ketone (1) and para to Br (4). That structure would have 1 (ketone), 4 (Br), 5 (nitro). But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Hmm, seems off. 

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the nitro group first, then the ketone. But as I thought before, nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work after that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ketone and bromine.

Wait, let me think of the target again: COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So, the ketone is at 1. Let's see: if the nitro is at 5, that's meta to the ketone. Br is at 3, which is meta to the ketone as well. So, perhaps the ketone is added first, then the nitro and bromine are added in such a way that they both are meta to the ketone.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added first. But then, how to add the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reactions. Let me look at option C:

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), iv) Br2/FeBr3, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that's a long sequence. Let's see: starting from benzene.

i) Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps a reduction? Fe/HCl is sometimes used to reduce nitro groups. So nitrobenzene → phenyl amine? Wait, nitrobenzene with Fe/HCl (like a catalytic hydrogenation?) or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used for the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amino groups, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think more accurately, nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenylamine with Fe/HCl (like in a Birch reduction?), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a demethylation or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think this through.

Wait, option C: after nitration, then Fe/HCl. So benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene, then treated with Fe and HCl. I think nitrobenzene can be reduced to phenyl amine (aniline) under certain conditions. For instance, using H2/Pd or Fe/HCl. So, nitro → amine. But why would we do that? Maybe to then perform some reaction.

Then, step iii is Friedel-Crafts acylation. But if we have an amine group on benzene, that's an activating group (since amines are strong activating, ortho/para directors). But Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, so maybe it's possible.

So, after nitration, reduction to amine, then Friedel-Crafts to add the ketone. But wait, after adding the ketone, the ring still has the amine group, which is a strong activating group. Then, further substitutions would be directed by the amine.

But wait, the target doesn't have an amine group. So this seems problematic. Also, the ketone is a meta director, which could conflict with the amine's ortho/para direction.

This might not lead to the correct substitution pattern.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) NaNO2/HCl, iv) H3PO2, v) Br2/FeBr3, vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3, vii) HNO3/H2SO4.

That's a complicated sequence. Let's see:

Starting from benzene.

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine: aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Aniline → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Wait, but sometimes H3PO2 is used in the Sandmeyer reaction. For example, converting diazonium salts to halides (like bromide, iodide) via the Sandmeyer reaction. But H3PO2 is used with CuCN to form cyanide, or with other reagents for different halides.

Wait, but in this case, option D's step iv is H3PO2, which is a reducing agent, but maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's H2SO4, or another condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form a chloride. Wait, I'm not too sure about this step.

Moving on, step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So, perhaps after forming a bromide?

Step vi is Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Step vii is another nitration.

But this seems like a convoluted path, and I'm not sure if the nitro and bromine would end up in the correct positions.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) Fe/HCl → reduce.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → perhaps reduce.

So, starting with bromobenzene.

Step i: bromobenzene.

Step ii: nitrate. Where would the nitro group go? Bromine is ortho/para director. So nitration would occur at ortho or para to Br. So, meta to the position where it is.

Wait, but let's think: starting with bromobenzene (Br at 1), nitration would add nitro at position 2 or 4 (ortho or para to Br). Let's say it adds at position 4.

Then step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation. But the ring now has Br (at 1) and nitro (at 4). Both are deactivating. So, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed because the ring is deactivated. So, I'm not sure this sequence works.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation, so benzene becomes acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So, bromine would add ortho or para to the ketone. So, in acetophenone, the ketone is at position 1, so bromine would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step iii: HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So, where would nitro go? The ketone is at 1, Br at 2 or 4.

Wait, let's say Br is at position 2. Then, the ketone at 1 is meta-directing. So, nitration would occur at position 4 (meta to ketone). But Br is at 2. So, would the nitro group go to position 4, which is para to Br and meta to ketone.

Wait, but the target requires nitro at 5, which is meta to ketone at 1. So, this may not align.

Alternatively, let's walk through option A:

i) Add ketone → acetophenone (1).

ii) Brominate → Br at 2 or 4.

Assuming Br at 2.

Step iii: Nitration. The ketone directs meta (positions 3 and 5). Br at 2 is ortho/para director, so would direct to positions 1 (already occupied) and 3 (ortho to Br at 2). So nitro could go to position 3.

But the target requires nitro at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, Br adds at position 4. Then, during nitration, the ketone directs to 3 and 5. Br at 4 is ortho/para, so it would direct to 3 and 5 (ortho and para relative to Br).

So, nitration could add nitro at position 3 or 5.

If nitro adds at 5, then the structure would have ketone at 1, Br at 4, nitro at 5. But the target has Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is at position 4, and then the nitro is at 3.

But then the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 4 (Br). Which is different from the target.

So, perhaps option A isn't the right sequence.

Looking back, perhaps the correct order is to add the ketone first, then the nitro, then the bromine. But earlier I thought that after nitration, adding bromine would be difficult because of deactivation.

Alternatively, maybe after adding ketone and nitro, we can perform some other reaction to add bromine.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitro group can be converted into another group that is a better leaving group, allowing substitution.

But that's getting into more complex steps, which might not be part of the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the bromine. Let me think: 

Step 1: benzene → ketone (Friedel-Crafts).

Step 2: bromination → Br at 2 or 4.

Step 3: nitration. But the ring is deactivating because of Br and ketone. So nitration would be difficult.

Wait, but perhaps the nitro group is introduced via some other method, like diazotization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a meta director in a way that it ends up at position 5.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5 relative to the ketone at 1. So, what's the correct order of addition to get them in those positions.

If the ketone is first, then the next substituents have to be added in such a way that their positions are meta to the ketone.

So, when adding nitro and bromine, they should go to positions 3 and 5, which are meta to the ketone.

But how to achieve that? Because when adding substituents after the ketone, the next substituents would be directed by the ketone's meta directive.

So, for the nitro group, it would go to position 3 or 5.

Then, the bromine would go to the other position.

But the problem is that adding bromine after nitro would require the ring to be activated, which it isn't because the ring has the nitro group (deactivating).

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added before the nitro group.

So, step 1: benzene → ketone (1).

Step 2: bromination → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone).

Is that possible?

Wait, after step 2, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Now, when nitrating, the nitro group would be directed by both substituents.

The ketone at 1 is meta-directing, so would direct nitro to 3 (occupied) and 5.

The Br at 3 is ortho/para-directing. So, it would direct nitro to 2 and 4.

So, the nitro group would have to choose between positions 5 and 2/4.

But in the target, nitro is at 5, which is meta to ketone. So, perhaps the nitro group would be directed there.

Is that possible? The ketone is a stronger director than the Br? Or perhaps because the Br is ortho/para, and the ketone is meta, the nitro could end up at 5.

But I'm not sure. It depends on the relative strengths of the directing groups.

Wait, the ketone is a meta director and deactivating, while Br is ortho/para and deactivating. So, the nitro group would be directed to positions that are meta to the ketone or ortho/para to Br.

Which position is available? Let's see: the ketone is at 1. So, meta is 3 (occupied by Br) and 5. Br is at 3, so ortho is 2 and 4, and para is position 6.

So, the available positions for nitro are 5 and 2,4,6.

But the target requires nitro at 5. So, perhaps the nitro group is added to position 5, which is meta to ketone.

So, that could work. So, the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation → ketone at 1.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

But wait, after step 2, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). So, during nitration, would the nitro group go to position 5?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration could be directed by the ketone to position 5.

So, that would give the target structure.

But then, how does bromination come after step 2? Because after step 1, the ring has the ketone.

So, step 2 would be bromination at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Then step 3, nitration at position 5 (meta to ketone).

So, the sequence would be ketone, bromine, nitro.

Looking back at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at the options:

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl, iii) Friedel-Crafts, iv) Br, v) nitration, etc. No, that's not the case.

Option D: starts with nitration, then Fe/HCl, etc. Not matching.

Option B: starts with Br, then nitration, etc.

Option A: i) Friedel-Crafts, ii) Br, iii) nitration, iv) HCl/Fe, v) nitration, etc.

So, option A: let's see.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone (ketone at 1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So, Br adds ortho or para to ketone. So, positions 2 or 4.

Assuming Br adds at 2.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (2). So, where would nitro go?

Ketone (1) is meta-directing → positions 3 and 5.

Br (2) is ortho/para-directing → positions 1 (occupied), 3 (ortho to Br), and 4 (para to Br).

So, possible positions for nitro: 3,4,5.

If nitro adds at position 3, which is meta to ketone and ortho to Br, that could happen.

Then, the structure would have ketone at 1, Br at 2, nitro at 3.

But the target requires Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps in option A, the Br adds to position 4 in step ii.

So, acetophenone (1), then Br at 4.

Then step iii: nitration. The ring has 1 (ketone) and 4 (Br). So, ketone directs to 3 and 5. Br (4) is ortho/para, directing to 3 and 5 (ortho) and 1 (para, which is occupied).

So, nitro could add at 3 or 5.

If nitro adds at 5, that's meta to ketone and ortho to Br at 4.

So, the structure would be: ketone at 1, Br at 4, nitro at 5.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option where after adding the ketone, the bromine is added at position 3, then nitro at 5.

Looking at the options, does any option have Friedel-Crafts first, then bromine, then nitration?

Option A: after Friedel-Crafts (step i), step ii is bromination, then step iii is nitration.

So, in option A: acetophenone (1), then Br at 2 or 4, then nitro.

But as I thought before, after Br is at 2, nitro would go to 3 or 5.

Wait, perhaps in step ii, the bromine adds to position 4, then in step iii, nitro adds at position 5.

So, then, the structure would be ketone (1), Br (4), nitro (5).

But target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So, not matching.

So, none of the options seem to fit this way. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added before the ketone. But that would require that the ring is nitrated before being activated for Friedel-Crafts, which isn't possible because the nitro group deactivates the ring.

So, that can't be.

Another approach: think about the positions of substitution. The target has substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, if the ketone is added last, that's not possible. So ketone must be first.

Alternative plan: perhaps the order is ketone, Br, then nitro. But in that case, nitro would have to go to position 5, which is meta to ketone and perhaps ortho to Br.

Wait, in that case, the steps would be:

1. ketone (1).

2. Br at 3.

3. nitro at 5.

So, which option has that order? Let me check.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: steps i) ketone, ii) Br, iii) nitro.

So, that's exactly the order I'm thinking.

So, in option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → ketone (1).

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

But wait, wait, Br2/FeBr3 is for electrophilic substitution, so Br adds ortho/para to the directing group. The ketone is a meta director, so during bromination, Br would add at meta positions relative to ketone, which are positions 3 and 5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituent's directing effect is based on their own nature. The ketone is meta-directing, so during bromination, Br would add at meta positions (3 and 5).

So, in step ii of option A, bromination would add Br at position 3 or 5.

Assuming it adds at position 3, then step iii is nitration. Nitration would be directed by the ketone (meta) and Br (ortho/para).

So, where would nitro add?

Ketone directs to position 5 (meta). Br at 3 directs to positions 2 and 4 (ortho) and 6 (para). 

So, nitro would be directed to position 5 (meta to ketone), which is available.

So, the nitro adds at 5.

So, the structure now has:

1: ketone, 3: Br, 5: nitro.

Which matches the target.

So, the order in option A is ketone, Br, nitro, which gives the correct positions.

But wait, let's confirm the steps in option A.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → ketone at 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So, Br adds at 3 or 5.

Assuming Br adds at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Nitro adds at 5.

Then, the subsequent steps iv to vii: what are they?

iv) Fe/HCl.

v) HNO3/H2SO4.

vi) NaNO2/HCl.

vii) H3PO2.

Wait, but if we've already achieved the target after step iii, why are there more steps? So, perhaps option A includes some other reactions beyond what's needed. But maybe the question is about the entire synthesis, which might involve more steps, but the key is the correct sequence to get the main substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the subsequent steps in option A are just distractors.

Wait, but the question asks which sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis of the target compound. So, perhaps the steps after step iii are not relevant as long as the initial steps correctly set the substituents.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction steps after the nitration are part of the synthesis, but I don't see how they contribute.

Wait, looking back, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, after steps i, ii, iii, we have the correct substituents. So, the rest of the steps in option A might be unnecessary, but perhaps they are part of the synthetic steps.

Wait, but why would they include more steps beyond what's needed? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine and nitro groups are added in a different order, such that the nitro is added before the bromine.

Wait, but I thought that after adding nitro, the ring becomes deactivated, making subsequent substitution difficult. So, perhaps the correct order is to add the bromine after the nitro.

But earlier analysis indicated that that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added via a different method that doesn't require electrophilic substitution, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, another way: perhaps the target is synthesized via a different approach, using meta directors to place substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added via a coupling reaction, but again, that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I should summarize the reasoning so far.

The target requires three substituents: ketone (1), Br (3), nitro (5).

The correct order of addition is ketone first, then Br, then nitro.

Looking at the options, option A's steps i, ii, iii do that.

So, option A is the correct sequence.

But wait, let's think about the positions during bromination after the ketone. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the Br would add at 3 or 5.

So, in step ii of option A, Br adds at 3.

Then, in step iii, nitration would add nitro at 5.

So, the structure matches the target.

So, the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must ensure that the ketone group is introduced first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions. The ketone group is a meta-directing, deactivating substituent, so it must be added early to allow subsequent substitutions to occur at the desired meta positions. The bromine and nitro groups are also deactivating, and their positions must be carefully controlled to match the target structure.

### Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) introduces the ketone group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Bromination (`Br2/FeBr3`) adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **Step iii**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and ortho to bromine).
4. The subsequent steps (iv–vii) do not alter the substituents at positions 1, 3, or 5, so the target structure is achieved after step iii.

This sequence correctly places the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the desired positions.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Bromination (`Br2/FeBr3`) adds bromine to benzene, resulting in bromobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds a nitro group ortho or para to bromine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) introduces the ketone group.
4. However, the ketone group cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro because the ring is already deactivated by these groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation impossible. This sequence does not lead to the target structure.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds a nitro group to benzene, resulting in nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (`Fe/HCl`) converts the nitro group to an amine group.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) introduces the ketone group.
4. **Step iv**: Bromination (`Br2/FeBr3`) adds bromine.
5. **Step v**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds another nitro group.
6. **Steps vi–vii**: Diazotization and reduction do not contribute to the desired structure.

The nitro group introduced in step i is not part of the target structure, and the sequence does not achieve the correct substitution pattern.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds a nitro group to benzene, resulting in nitrobenzene.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction (`Fe/HCl`) converts the nitro group to an amine group.
3. **Step iii**: Diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) forms a diazonium salt.
4. **Step iv**: Reduction (`H3PO2`) converts the diazonium salt to a halide.
5. **Step v**: Bromination (`Br2/FeBr3`) adds bromine.
6. **Step vi**: Friedel-Crafts acylation (`CH3COCl/AlCl3`) introduces the ketone group.
7. **Step vii**: Nitration (`HNO3/H2SO4`) adds another nitro group.

The sequence introduces multiple nitro groups and does not achieve the correct substitution pattern for the target structure.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only sequence that correctly introduces the ketone group first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct meta positions relative to the ketone. The subsequent steps in Option A do not alter the desired substituents, ensuring the target structure is synthesized.
