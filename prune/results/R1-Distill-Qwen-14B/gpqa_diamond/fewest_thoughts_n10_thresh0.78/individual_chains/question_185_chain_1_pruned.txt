Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I know that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, there are three of them: σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And the vector n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction on the sphere. The dot product here means we're taking the component of the spin in the direction of n.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, right? So H must be a 2x2 matrix as well. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But perhaps there's a shortcut here because the structure of H is a spin component in a particular direction.

I remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenvalues of any component (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) are ±ħ/2. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is ε times the spin component in direction n. So maybe the eigenvalues would be scaled by ε?

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, not ±ħ/2. Oh wait no, wait. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the actual spin component S·n would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But here, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ·n, which is like the spin without the ħ/2 factor. So let's clarify: σ·n is a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1, because σ·n can be written as σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, the eigenvalues would be when you measure the spin in that direction, which is ±1 times some scaling.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. For example, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. When you have a general direction n, the matrix σ·n is a combination of the Pauli matrices, but since it's a dot product with a unit vector, the matrix is effectively a spin component in that direction. So the eigenvalues of σ·n
