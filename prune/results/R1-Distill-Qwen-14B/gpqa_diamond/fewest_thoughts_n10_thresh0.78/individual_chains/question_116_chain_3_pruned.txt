Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from Compound A. Let's break down the information given.

First, Compound A's proton NMR has two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell me about the structure. A triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests two neighboring protons. Wait, because splitting is based on neighboring protons. So a triplet comes from two neighboring groups. Oh wait, no. Wait, each neighboring set of protons causes splitting. So a triplet would mean that each H in this group is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Wait, no, the triplet would come from being next to a group with two protons. Because the number of splits is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H's. So a triplet is two neighboring H's. So if I have a triplet integrating for 6H, that's probably from a (CH2CH3) group. Because a CH2 group would split into a triplet when next to another CH2. Wait, let me think: if you have a CH2CH3 group, the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH3. Wait, no, the CH3 would be a triplet because each H in the CH3 is adjacent to two H's in the CH2. Wait, no: Wait, no, the CH3 would be a quartet if adjacent to a CH2. Because the CH2 has two protons, each of the CH3 protons would see two neighboring H's. Wait, no, wait. The CH3 group is next to a CH2. The CH3 would be split by the CH2. The number of splitting is based on neighboring Hs. So if the CH2 has two Hs, then each H in CH3 would be split into a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). So the CH3 would be a triplet. So the triplet integrating for 6H suggests two CH3 groups? Because 6H divided by 3 would be 2 groups. So maybe it's a (CH2CH3)2 group, like diethyl or something else.

Wait, but the other peak is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies three neighboring protons. Because quartet is n=3 (n+1=4). Wait, or maybe it's a quartet from coupling with a CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet comes from a group adjacent to another group with three Hs. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. The NMR data for Compound A suggests two sets of protons. Let me think about common structures. Diethyl ether comes to mind. Diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But wait, the CH2 in diethyl ether is adjacent to another CH2, so each CH2 is next to another CH2. So the CH2CH3 groups: the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2 which has 2 Hs), and the CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH3 which has 3 Hs). But wait, in diethyl ether, each CH2CH3 is connected via an oxygen. So the CH3 would be a triplet, and the CH2 would be a quartet. But in the given data, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm (which is about where CH3 groups are, especially in ethers) and the quartet is at 1.3 ppm, which is where CH2 groups might be in ethers.

So for diethyl ether: the CH3 groups would be a triplet, integrating for 6H (since two CH3, 3H each). The CH2 groups would be a quartet, integrating for 4H (two CH2, 2H each). That matches the given data for Compound A. So Compound A is likely diethyl ether, (CH2CH3)2O.

Wait a minute, but diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups. So each CH2 is next to another CH2. So in diethyl ether, each CH2 is connected to an O and adjacent to another CH2. So the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the oxygen. So each CH2 group is adjacent to another CH2, but wait, no. Each CH2 is connected to an O and to a CH3. So each CH2 is only adjacent to one CH3 (from the same ethyl group) and one O. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it.

Structure of diethyl ether: O connected to two CH2CH3 groups. Each CH2 is connected to O and to CH3. So each CH2 is adjacent to O and a CH3. So the CH2 groups are each connected to two Hs, and each is adjacent to a CH3 group with three Hs. So the CH2 would be a quartet, as each H in the CH2 is next to three H's (from the CH3). Wait, no. Wait, each H in the CH2 is adjacent to the adjacent CH3 group which has three H's. So the CH2 would split into a quartet (n=3, so n+1=4). That matches the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H (two CH2 groups, each 2H). And the CH3 groups would each be adjacent to a CH2 with two Hs, so the CH3 would be a triplet (n=2, so n+1=3). And 6H in total, which matches the triplet at 0.9 ppm. So yes, A is diethyl ether.

So A is diethyl ether, which is (CH2CH3)2O.

Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. Monobromination of diethyl ether. Hmm, what does that mean? Diethyl ether has two ethyl groups attached to oxygen. Monobromination could involve substitution of one of the ethyl groups. Wait, but in diethyl ether,
