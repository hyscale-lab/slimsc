Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, the formula given is number of stars N proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since parallax plx is equal to 1/distance (d), that is, plx = 1/d. So plx is inversely proportional to d. So I can write plx = k/d, where k is some constant.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to find how N varies with d. Let's substitute plx in terms of d into the equation.

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, so (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5. So 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me read again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Oh, so per unit distance. So perhaps it's the differential number of stars with respect to distance.

Wait, another approach: the number of stars in a small range of distance. Let's think in terms of differentials. Let's model the number of stars as a function of distance.

From the given, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

But when considering the number of stars per unit distance, that would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if you have more stars as d increases, the rate of change (slope) tells you how many stars are added per unit distance.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. If the number of stars in a certain region is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d
