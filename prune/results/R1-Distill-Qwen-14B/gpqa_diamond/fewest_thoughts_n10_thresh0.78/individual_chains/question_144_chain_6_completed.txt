--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean decay distance depends on some properties like their production energy, mass, and width. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me think. Oh right, the mean decay distance (often called the decay length) is calculated using the formula that involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But wait, how do I find the lifetime from the given parameters?

I recall that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ. The uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but Γ is the decay width, which is given in MeV. I have to be careful with the units here.

So, the steps I think I need to take are:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ of the meson.
2. Determine the particle's velocity using its energy and mass.
3. Calculate the mean decay distance using distance = velocity * lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find the velocity? The energy given is production energy E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is higher than the rest mass, meaning the meson is moving relativistically.

I remember that the total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for p, the momentum.

Let me write that down: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So, rearranging for p: p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / (c²). Wait, no, better to write it as p = sqrt( (E^2)/(c^4) - m² c² ) / c. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, but I have to be cautious with unit conversions.

Wait, actually, in natural units where c=1, E and m are in the same units (GeV). So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Then the momentum squared would be E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2. Let me calculate that: 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) GeV/c. Wait, sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, GeV/c squared? No, because when you take the square root of (GeV^2), you get GeV, so p would be in GeV/c? Wait, maybe I'm mixing units here. Let me think again.

In natural units (c=1), E has units of GeV, m as well. So p would be in GeV. But when I bring back the c factors, probably in some way. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of E and m in terms of energy, and compute beta and gamma factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the velocity beta (β = v/c) using the relation:

β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²) )

Wait, since E = gamma m c², then yes, beta squared is 1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2). So in natural units, beta would be sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2).

So plugging in the numbers: m=1.2 GeV, E=8 GeV.

m/E = 1.2 /8 = 0.15. So (m/E)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Close to the speed of light, which makes sense because E >> m.

So beta is about 0.9887 c. So the velocity is approximately 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me see, 0.9887 squared is approximately 0.9775, yes. So I can proceed with beta ≈ 0.9887.

Next, I need the lifetime tau. As I thought earlier, tau is given by hbar / Gamma. But Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Hbar has units of GeV·s. Wait, what's the value of hbar in GeV·s?

Planck constant h is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So hbar is h/(2pi) ≈ 6.582e-25 / (6.283) ≈ 1.045e-24 GeV·s.

Wait, let me get that exact. hbar = 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. But converting J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 J = 6.242e18 eV. So h = 6.626e-34 J·s = 6.626e-34 * 6.242e18 eV·s = approximately 4.135667696e-15 eV·s.

But when using GeV, it's hbar ≈ 6.5823e-25 GeV·s. Yes, that's what I remember.

So, tau = hbar / Gamma.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.5823e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )

Calculating that: 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.05696875e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Now, the mean decay distance is beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I thought distance is velocity multiplied by time. Velocity is beta c, time is tau. So distance L = beta c tau.

Wait, but I have to account for gamma factor? Hmm, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau.

Wait, no, wait, no. The lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau). So the actual lifetime is gamma * tau.

The velocity is beta c. So the distance is v * t = beta c * (gamma tau) = beta gamma c tau.

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). Because E = gamma m c².

In our case, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m, so gamma is E/m. But since earlier I used E and m in GeV, which are energy units, but m is in GeV/c², so when I compute gamma, it's E/(m c²). But with c=1, it's E/m.

So gamma = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6666667.

So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So putting it all together: L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, but beta is 0.9887, gamma is 6.6667, c is speed of light, tau is 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ approximately 6.6 (exactly, 0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ 6.6 (since 6.6666667 is 20/3, 0.9887 * 20/3 = 0.9887 * 6.666... ≈ 6.6 (exact approx? Let me calculate:

20/3 = 6.6666667

0.9887 * 6.6666667 ≈ 6.6 * 6.6666667? No, wait, 0.9887 * 6.6666667.

Wait, 1 * 6.6666667 = 6.6666667.

So 0.9887 is about 0.9887 * 6.6666667 = ?

Let me compute:

6.6666667 * 0.9887 = ?

Compute 6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6591 (since 0.6666667 is 2/3, 2/3 of 0.9887 is approx 0.6591).

Adding together: 5.9322 + 0.6591 = 6.5913.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.5913.

So L = (beta gamma) * c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

6.5913 * 3e8 = 1.97739e9.

Then multiply by 2.057e-24:

1.97739e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.057) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.97739 * 2.057:

Approx: 2 * 2.057 = 4.114, but 1.977 is a bit less than 2, so 4.114 minus 0.023 * 2.057? Wait, no, better to compute 1.97739 × 2.057.

Compute 1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478.

1.97739 * 0.057 = approx 0.1127.

So total is approx 3.95478 + 0.1127 ≈ 4.06748.

So approx 4.0675e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m. The closest option is B) 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta or gamma.

Let me recalculate gamma more accurately. Gamma is E/m. E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.9775) precisely.

What's 0.9887 squared? (0.9887)^2 = (0.98 * 0.98) + ... Let me compute:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)²

= 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087²

= 0.9604 + 0.017208 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.017208 = 0.977608 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97768369.

Wait, but 0.9887 squared is about 0.97768, and we have sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So that's correct.

So beta is 0.9887.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6666667 = let's compute it more accurately.

6.6666667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 = (2/3)*0.9887 ≈ 0.659133.

Adding together: 5.9322 + 0.659133 = 6.591333.

So 6.591333.

So L = 6.591333 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.5823e-25 / 0.32 = 2.05696875e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.591333 * 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.591333 * 3 = 19.773999.

Then 19.773999e8 (which is 1.9773999e9) * 2.05696875e-24.

Multiply 1.9773999e9 by 2.05696875e-24:

The exponents are e9 * e-24 = e-15.

1.9773999 * 2.05696875 = let's compute this.

1.9774 * 2.05696875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.05696875 = 4.1139375.

But 1.9774 is 2 - 0.0226.

So 2.05696875 * (2 - 0.0226) = 2 * 2.05696875 - 0.0226 * 2.05696875.

= 4.1139375 - 0.0465.

Which is approximately 4.0674.

So 4.0674e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close enough, considering rounding in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, the exact computation:

(6.591333) * (3e8) * (2.05696875e-24) = ?

Compute 6.591333 * 3e8 = 1.9773999e9.

Then 1.9773999e9 * 2.05696875e-24 = 1.9773999 * 2.05696875 * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9773999 * 2.05696875.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

1.9774 * 2.05696875.

Break it down:

2.05696875 = 2 + 0.05696875.

So, 1.9774 * 2 = 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.05696875 = ?

Compute 0.05 * 1.9774 = 0.09887.

0.00696875 * 1.9774 ≈ 0.013786.

So adding those: 0.09887 + 0.013786 ≈ 0.112656.

So total is 3.9548 + 0.112656 ≈ 4.067456.

So 4.067456e-15 meters.

The options are B) 4.0655e-15 and C) 5.0223e-15.

So B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close to my result of approximately 4.06745e-15.

The small discrepancy could be due to more precise calculations or exact values of constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me recheck the calculation of tau.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

hbar = 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.5823e-25) / 0.32 = 2.05696875e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887, but perhaps more accurately, let's compute the exact value.

Compute sqrt(0.9775).

Let me use a calculator approach.

We can compute it as follows:

We know that 0.9887^2 = 0.97768, as before.

But 0.9775 is a bit less.

Let me compute (0.9887 - delta)^2 = 0.9775.

(0.9887 - delta)^2 = 0.9887² - 2*0.9887 * delta + delta² = 0.97768 - 1.9774 delta + delta².

Set this equal to 0.9775.

So 0.97768 - 1.9774 delta ≈ 0.9775.

Ignoring delta², 0.97768 - 1.9774 delta = 0.9775.

So 0.97768 - 0.9775 = 1.9774 delta.

0.00018 = 1.9774 delta.

delta = 0.00018 / 1.9774 ≈ 9.097e-5.

So beta ≈ 0.9887 - 0.00009097 ≈ 0.988609.

So beta ≈ 0.988609.

So beta * gamma = 0.988609 * (8/1.2) = 0.988609 * 6.666666667.

Compute 0.988609 *6= 5.931654.

0.988609 * 0.666666667 = 0.65907267.

Adding together: 5.931654 + 0.65907267 ≈ 6.5907267.

So beta gamma ≈ 6.5907267.

So L = 6.5907267 * 3e8 m/s * 2.05696875e-24 s.

Compute 6.5907267 * 3 = 19.77218.

19.77218e8 = 1.977218e9.

Multiply by 2.05696875e-24:

1.977218e9 * 2.05696875e-24 = (1.977218 * 2.05696875) * 1e-15.

Calculate 1.977218 * 2.05696875.

Let me compute 2 * 2.05696875 = 4.1139375.

But 1.977218 is 0.022782 less than 2.

So 2.05696875 * (-0.022782) ≈ -0.0468.

So 4.1139375 - 0.0468 = 4.0671375.

So 4.0671375e-15 m.

Hmm, that's very close to 4.067e-15, but the option B is 4.0655e-15, which is slightly lower.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers through the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of beta gamma or in the initial steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the decay length in terms of the particle's parameters.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length L is given by L = (E * c * hbar ) / (m * Gamma) ) * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

Wait, yeah, let me try that.

L = (E * c * hbar ) * beta / (m * Gamma )

But remember that beta is sqrt(1 - (m²/E²)).

So,

L = (E c ħ beta ) / (m Gamma )

Plugging the numbers:

E = 8 GeV,

m =1.2 GeV,

Gamma = 0.32 GeV,

beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )= sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.988609.

hbar = 6.5823e-25 GeV s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So putting it all together:

L = (8 GeV * 3e8 m/s * 6.5823e-25 GeV s ) * 0.988609 / (1.2 GeV * 0.32 GeV )

Wait, wait, units:

Wait, GeV in numerator and denominator.

Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 8 * 3e8 * 6.5823e-25 * 0.988609.

Denominator: 1.2 * 0.32.

Wait, but let me write the formula correctly.

Wait, L = (E c ħ beta) / (m Gamma )

So, substitute:

L = (8 * 3e8 m/s * 6.5823e-25 GeV·s * 0.988609 ) / (1.2 * 0.32 )

Compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 8 * 3e8 * 6.5823e-25 * 0.988609.

First, compute 8 *3e8 =2.4e9.

Then 2.4e9 *6.5823e-25 = 2.4e9 *6.5823e-25 = 2.4 *6.5823 * 1e-16 = 15.80032 * 1e-16 = 1.580032e-15.

Multiply by 0.988609: 1.580032e-15 *0.988609 ≈ 1.5644e-15.

Denominator: 1.2 *0.32 = 0.384.

So L = (1.5644e-15 ) / 0.384 ≈ 4.0737e-15 meters.

Hmm, which is about 4.07e-15 meters. The options are B) 4.0655e-15 and C) 5.02e-15.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me compute the numerator again.

Numerator:

8 *3e8 =2.4e9.

2.4e9 *6.5823e-25 = 2.4e9 *6.5823e-25.

= 2.4 *6.5823 *1e-16.

2.4 *6.5823 = let's compute.

6 *2.4 =14.4, 0.5823 *2.4=1.39752.

Total: 14.4 +1.39752=15.79752.

So 15.79752e-16 = 1.579752e-15.

Multiply by beta 0.988609: 1.579752e-15 *0.988609 ≈ ?

1.579752 *0.988609 ≈ approximately 1.55996e-15.

Denominator: 1.2 *0.32=0.384.

So L = 1.55996e-15 /0.384 ≈ 4.061e-15 m.

Which is 4.061e-15, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.

So considering possible rounding, the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m}{E}\right)^2} \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \),
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \beta \)
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.5823 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \). Using \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.5823 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The speed of light is \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting into the formula for \( L \):
\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau = 6.5913 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.05696875 \times 10^{-24}
\]

First, calculate the product:
\[
6.5913 \times 3 = 19.7739
\]
\[
19.7739 \times 2.05696875 \approx 40.674 \times 10^{-15}
\]

Thus:
\[
L \approx 4.0674 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Compare with options
The closest option to \( 4.0674 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**. The small discrepancy arises from rounding constants and intermediate values.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
