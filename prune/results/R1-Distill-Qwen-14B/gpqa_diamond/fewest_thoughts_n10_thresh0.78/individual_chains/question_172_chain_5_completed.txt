Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're told the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I'm thinking that we should use the Boltzmann distribution here because that's what applies in LTE conditions.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, the population ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is twice that of star_2. Let's denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron. Also, assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both levels in both stars (since it's the same element and same energy levels), the ratio of the populations simplifies to R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

So for each star:

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But R1 = 2 R2. Substituting the expressions:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can rearrange this equation. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

The left side simplifies to -ΔE/(k T1). The right side uses the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b, so it becomes ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Putting it all together:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation to group the terms with T1 and T2.

Let me bring the ΔE terms to one side. So:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Alternatively, that can be written as (ΔE/k)( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2). Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check that:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, because (T1 - T2) is the numerator when you find a common denominator T1 T2.

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the problem gives the value of ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. I'm not sure if that's needed here because the options don't include ΔE. So maybe we can rearrange the equation in terms of T1 and T2 without ΔE.

Wait, let me think about the options given. The options all have ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2. So perhaps I should solve for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

From the equation:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / [ T1 T2 ]

So, ln(2) = (ΔE (T1 - T2)) / (k T1 T2 )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a ΔE or k in them. That suggests perhaps the ΔE terms are incorporated into the equation in a way that it's not needed for the form of the answer, or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me go back. Another approach: since both stars are in LTE, the ratio of their excitation depends on their temperatures. The excitation for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2, where R is the ratio.

So, R1/R2 = 2. But R1 is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), R2 is exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which equals exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Set this equal to 2:

exp( ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] ) ) = 2

Take natural log on both sides:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Again, same equation as before.

But wait, the options don't involve ΔE or k, so perhaps ΔE/(k) is a constant, but since it's given, maybe it's supposed to cancel out in the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the temperatures can be found without considering the actual value of ΔE.

Wait, maybe I can express the ratio of the temperatures.

Let me denote equation as:

(ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the two populations can be expressed in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, the question is about finding an equation where ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

So the correct equation is ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

But looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2). But wait, that doesn't include the ΔE and k factors. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the ratio. Let's think again.

The ratio R1 = n1_upper/n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Dividing both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), we get:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2.

Take ln both sides:

[ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's the negative of what I had before. Because I have 1/T2 - 1/T1 = -(1/T1 -1/T2) = - (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) )

So:

ΔE/(k) * ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to compute 1/T2 -1/T1.

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So substituting, we get:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, no, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So:

[ΔE/(k)] * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the options assume that ΔE/(k) is a constant and can be incorporated into the equation as a multiplier, but since all options have ln(2) on one side, perhaps the correct form is that the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 T2) multiplied by some constants.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is similar to the equation I have, except multiplied by (ΔE/k). But in the options, that factor isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the ratio of the excitation. Since R1 = 2 R2, and R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), then R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2. So:

exp( [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

[ΔE/(k)] * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, the equation is:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, which are constants. So perhaps this approach isn't directly leading me to the options given.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the excitation energy is proportional to the temperature, but maybe in the form of the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the ratio of the excitation as (T2 / T1) to some power equals 2.

Wait, let me think about the formula again.

The Boltzmann factor is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio R = n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, then the ratio R1/R2 is exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, let me write that again:

R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Set R1/R2 = 2.

So:

exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln:

[ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

[ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So, ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But again, the options don't have the ΔE/k term. So perhaps the correct equation is the form in option D, which is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, that can't be right because the equation I arrived at includes the ΔE and k terms. But the options don't include any physics constants, which suggests that perhaps the question is looking for the correct structure of the equation, assuming that the other terms are factored into the expression.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the excitation is inversely related to the temperature. So a higher temperature leads to a higher population in the upper level, so if star_1 has twice as excited (more population in upper level), then T1 is higher than T2. So T1 > T2.

Hmm, but in the equation I have, (T1 - T2) is positive, so the right side is positive, which makes sense because ln(2) is positive.

But the options don't include any constants. So perhaps the correct form is option D, which is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options again:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that matches the structure I derived, except for the constants. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but why are the options written in such a way? Because in the equation I have, the right-hand side is [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] multiplied by ΔE/(k). But the options don't have that, so perhaps the problem is simplified by assuming that ΔE/(k) is a constant and can be absorbed into the equation, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what ΔE/(k) is.

Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's interesting. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K. So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the answer is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (star_1 and star_2) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are in LTE, so the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, the ratio of excitation levels simplifies to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, let the excitation ratios be \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), respectively. The problem states \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the Boltzmann factor expressions for each star:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \) gives:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the identity \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Since \( \Delta E / k = (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}) / (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}) = 1 \, \text{K} \), the \( \Delta E / k \) term cancels out, leaving:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the structure of option D. The other options are inconsistent with the derived relationship:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not involve the ratio \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary sum \( T_1 + T_2 \).
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it includes an incorrect denominator \( (T_1 T_2)^2 \).

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
