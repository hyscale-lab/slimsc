Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work it out step by step.

Alright, the question says that Star_1 and Star_2 have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the mass information might not be directly relevant here. The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else I'm not seeing yet. Let me focus on the given abundances.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Oh right, those square brackets mean it's a logarithmic abundance ratio. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, actually, I think it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun. [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg abundance is the same as the Sun's as well.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars compared to each other. Or wait, no, wait the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So we need [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, but relative to some standard? Or perhaps the ratio is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) or (n_Si1 / H1) divided by (n_Si2 / H2)? Hmm, I need to think about how to compute that.

Wait, maybe I should compute [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio of those two. Because [Si/H
