Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about mutations in a gene that causes an anti-nutritional compound in barley. Hmm. Let's see what the question says.

The intact gene has a certain sequence, and they've provided four mutants. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Since the gene was found to be responsible for the compound, probably a loss-of-function mutation would be desired. So we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences, each mutant differs from the intact gene. Let's examine each one to see where the changes are and what kind of mutations they are.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing, the first part is ATGTTTCT in intact vs ATGTTCTA in mutant 1. Wait, let me count the nucleotides. The first few nucleotides: Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCT..., mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, the first part of the intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So breaking it down:

Intact:
Position 1-3: ATG (start codon)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
... and so on.

Mutant 1: 
Position 1-3: ATG
4-6: TCT (instead of TTT)
7-9: ACG (instead of CTC)
10-12: C (wait, does the sequence change? Let me see.

Wait, instead of writing it all out, maybe I should look for the exact mutations.

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first six nucleotides are ATGTTT in the intact. In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCT. So that's a change from TTT to TCT at positions 4-6. Then, looking at the next triplet: in intact, it's CTC (positions 7-9), but in mutant 1, it's ACG. So that's a change from CTC to A
