Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m with speed 0.5c. Wait, which one is which? Oh, I think it doesn't matter as long as I'm consistent, but I'll keep that in mind.

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. So I need to calculate both. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give something greater than the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v_a - v_b) / (1 - (v_a v_b)/(c²)). Wait, let me make sure. Oh yeah, if one object is moving at v_a and the other at v_b in the same direction, the relative speed of A with respect to B is (v_a - v_b)/(1 - (v_a v_b)/(c²)). 

Wait, in this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction, but who is moving faster? Astronaut A is at 0.6c, which is faster than B's 0.5c. So the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I should consider the direction or the order. Because if I'm
