Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The problem says that we have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I need to normalize this state to find the actual coefficients because right now, it's just proportional—it doesn't necessarily have a magnitude of 1.

Wait, so the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2−i) for |down>. To normalize, I need to compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide each coefficient by the square root of that inner product.

The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)*(1−i) + (2−i)*(2+i). Because when you take the inner product, it's the sum of the products of each coefficient with its complex conjugate. Let me calculate that.

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i + i -i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2.

Second term: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2*2 + 2*i - i*2 -i*i = 4 +2i -2i -i². The i terms cancel out, and -i² is +1, so 4 +1 =5.

Adding these together, 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2−i)/√7 |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator. The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, because we're dealing with a two-level system (up and down are the z-basis), the matrix will be 2x2.

So the matrix A will have 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So it's:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0 ]

Hmm, what kind of operator is this? It looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A would be (ħ/2) * X, where X is the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of operator A are the same as those of X. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |−x> is (|up> − |down>)/√2, right?

Wait, no, let me think. The eigenstates of X are the states |+x> and |−x>, which are (|0> + |1>)/√2 and
