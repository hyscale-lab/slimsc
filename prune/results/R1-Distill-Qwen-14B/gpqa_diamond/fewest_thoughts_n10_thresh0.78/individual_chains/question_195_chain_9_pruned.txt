Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it through carefully.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii, such that both transit and occultation events occur. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I should probably break this down step by step. 

First, I remember transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the sizes of the objects. Oh right, transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we don't see its light. For both to happen, the orbital period needs to allow the planets to align in those positions relative to the star and us.

But how do orbital periods relate here? Oh, I think it's about the synodic period. The synodic period is the time between similar events (like transits) as seen from Earth. But wait, maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, the planets must be in such positions that their periods allow them to align in front and behind the star.

Wait, perhaps it's about the condition for mutual transits. For two planets to be able to transit each other's stars (or in this case, the same star), their orbital periods must be such that their orbital planes allow their transits. But wait, the question says both planets have the same orbital plane. So that's taken care of.

Hmm, no, maybe I should think about the timing of when each planet transits. The first planet transits every 3 days. The second planet's period is longer, so it transits less frequently. For both transit and occultation to occur, their orbital periods must allow their alignment in front and behind the star.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the ratio of their orbital periods. Oh wait, the key here might be the concept of the conjunction and opposition. For a planet to both transit and be occulted, it must be possible for it to pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star. But for that to happen regularly, its
