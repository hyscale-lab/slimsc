Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I need to find the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, so each electron is in a p orbital, which means their orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1 for each. The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. Let me break that down. The state is represented as |l₁, l₂, l, m>. So l₁ and l₂ are both 1, because each electron is in a p orbital. Then the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

Wait, but orbital angular momentum for each is l=1. So each electron has m values from -1, 0, +1. But when you couple two angular momenta, you can get possible total L values from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. So 1 + 1 is 2, and |1-1|=0. So possible total L are 0, 1, 2. In this case, the state is for L=2, m=-1.

But the question is about measuring L₁z and L₂z. So each L₁z is the z-component of the first electron's orbital angular momentum, and same for L₂z. The possible eigenvalues for each are -ħ, 0, +ħ. Because m can be -1, 0, +1, and since Lz = mħ, each m gives those values.

Wait, but the state given is |l₁=1, l₂=1, L=2, M=-1>. So how is this state expressed in terms of the individual m₁ and m₂? Because the coupled state is a combination of the product states with specific m₁ and m₂.

Hmm, I think the coupled state |L, M> is a linear combination of the product states |l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂>. So for L=2 and M=-1, the state can be written as a sum over m₁ and m₂ such that m₁ + m₂ = M = -1. But wait, each m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible pairs (m₁, m₂) that add up to -
