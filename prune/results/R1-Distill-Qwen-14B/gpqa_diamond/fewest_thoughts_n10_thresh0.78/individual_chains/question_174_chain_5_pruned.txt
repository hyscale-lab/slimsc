Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classical approximation. Let's see.

The problem states that an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, rest mass energy is mc², right? So M = 300 GeV / c². But I'm not sure if I'll need the actual mass in kg or if I can work with the given percentages.

When it undergoes spontaneous fission, it splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. So let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier one would be 2m. The sum of their masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. Wait, wait, no—wait, the sum is 99% of the initial mass M. So the sum is 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two fragments have masses m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. Oh wait, wait, no, 0.33 times M? Because 0.33 plus 0.66 is 0.99 M. Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of M. So 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission should be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. Because momentum is conserved.

But wait, in terms of magnitude, p1 = p2. Because one is moving in the opposite direction, so their magnitudes are the same.

So the kinetic energy of each fragment will depend on their velocities and masses. But since it's fission, it's probably a relativistic situation? Or maybe not? I'm not sure. But the question is about the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So I'll probably need to calculate both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases.

Wait, the problem gives the rest mass energy as 300 GeV. So the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. Because 300 * 0.99 is 297. So their combined rest mass is 297 GeV. But the initial rest mass was 300 GeV. So the mass energy difference is 3 GeV, which is the energy released, I suppose. But in reality, some energy is also kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the sum is 99% of M, which is 0.99 M. So the rest mass energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The initial rest mass energy was 300 GeV. So energy must have been released, which goes into the kinetic energy of the fragments.

So the total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. So that should equal the initial rest energy because energy is conserved (assuming no other particles are emitted, as the problem states that nothing else is produced besides the two fragments). So initial energy is 300 GeV. After fission, it's 297 GeV (rest masses) plus the kinetic energies of the two fragments, T1 and T2.

So 300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2. Therefore, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But I need to find T1 (the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment). So what else do I know?

Well, since momentum is conserved, and the fragments are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are equal in magnitude.

So for each fragment, p = gamma m v. But I think it's easier to work in terms of energy-momentum relations. The total energy for each fragment is E = gamma m c^2, and the momentum is p = gamma m v. Or, if I'm using units where c=1, then E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But maybe I should not set c=1 to avoid confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps using relativistic equations for energy and momentum. Let me see.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so total momentum is zero. After fission, each fragment has momentum p and -p.

So for fragment 1 (mass m1 = 0.66 M), its momentum is p, and fragment 2 (mass m2 = 0.33 M) has momentum -p.

So the magnitude of momentum for each is the same, |p|.

The energy of each fragment is E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ), and E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c^2)^2 ).

The sum of their kinetic energies is T1 + T2 = (E1 - m1 c^2) + (E2 - m2 c^2) ) = (E1 + E2) - (m1 + m2) c^2.

But we know that this sum is 3 GeV. So,

(E1 + E2) - (0.99 M c^2 ) = 3 GeV.

Wait, 0.99 M c^2 is 297 GeV, as we had earlier.

So, E1 + E2 = 297 GeV + 3 GeV = 300 GeV.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Hmm, but the initial energy is also 300 GeV. So that makes sense. Because the initial nucleus was at rest, so its energy is M c^2 = 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments' energies sum up to the same 300 GeV.

So, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

But E1 = sqrt( (p c )^2 +
