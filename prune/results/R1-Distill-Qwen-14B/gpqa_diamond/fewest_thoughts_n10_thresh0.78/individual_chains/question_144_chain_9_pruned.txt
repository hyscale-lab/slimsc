Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance means it's a particle that doesn't exist for very long, so it decays quickly. The question is asking about the mean decay distance.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, which are all on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So I need to find the average distance the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, how do I calculate the decay distance? I think it involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is c multiplied by the lifetime, and then multiplied by the velocity beta (since beta is v/c). So the formula should be L = c * tau * beta, where tau is the lifetime.

But how do I find tau? Oh, right, the uncertainty principle relates the width (which is inverse to the lifetime). The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime tau by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Wait, no, I think it's Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. Wait, I should check the formula. Alternatively, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused
