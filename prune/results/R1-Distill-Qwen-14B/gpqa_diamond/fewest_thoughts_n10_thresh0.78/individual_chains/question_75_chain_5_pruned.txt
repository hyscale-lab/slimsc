Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. So they're modifying the gene to include a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they're using Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they start expressing the protein, it's not happening as expected.

The provided DNA sequence is for the plus strand of the construct. The researcher notices an issue and the options are possible reasons why the protein isn't overexpressing.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.
B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.
C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.
D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what's wrong with the DNA construct.

First, I should probably look at the DNA sequence and see if there are any issues that would prevent proper translation.

Let's start by looking for the start codon. The start codon is usually ATG. Looking at the sequence, the very beginning is ATG... yes, the first three nucleotides are ATG, which codes for methionine, the start.

Then, after that, the next few codons. Let me parse the sequence in triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAA GC...

Wait, wait. Let me write this out as triplets to see the reading frame. Each set of three nucleotides is a codon.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGA CAC AGT TCC GGA AAA GC...

Wait, the first codon is ATG (start). Second is TAC (tyrosine). Third is CCA (proline). Fourth TAC (tyrosine again), then GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA...

Wait a second. TGA is a stop codon. Oh! So in the coding sequence, right after the start, there's a TGA which is a stop codon. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early. So the mRNA would be read from the start codon until the first stop codon, which is at position 12 (if I count correctly). So the construct's coding sequence has a premature stop codon.

Wait, let me recount the codons. The initial DNA sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... 

Wait, ATG is codon 1 (start). Then TAC (2), CCA (3), TAC (4), GAT (5), GTT (6), CCA (7), GAT (8), TAC (9), GCC (10), AAA (11), TGA (12). So the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. Oh, that's a problem. Because
