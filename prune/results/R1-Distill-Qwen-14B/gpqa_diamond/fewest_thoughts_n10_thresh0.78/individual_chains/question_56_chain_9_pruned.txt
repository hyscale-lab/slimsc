Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, certain selection rules apply. Let me think about what those are.

The problem states that the |3,0,0⟩ state decays to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process. I need to find out the possible intermediate states and the probability of each transition.

Wait, I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state after two transitions is n=1, l=0, m=0. So each transition must follow the selection rules.

First transition from n=3, l=0. Since Δl must be ±1, the next l can be 1. So the possible l values after first transition are 1.

So the first transition could go to l=1. Now, the possible m values after that transition would be m=0±1, so m=1 or m=-1, or stay at 0. But wait, from m=0, m can go to 1, 0, or -1. But let's think about the first transition.

So from |3,0,0⟩, the first transition must go to a state with l=1. The possible states are |2,1, m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1. So the possible intermediates are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩.

Then, from each of these, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩. So we need to see which of these intermediates can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Let's take each case:

Case 1: Intermediate is |2,1,1⟩. From here, to get to |1,0,0⟩, n must decrease by 1 (from 2 to
