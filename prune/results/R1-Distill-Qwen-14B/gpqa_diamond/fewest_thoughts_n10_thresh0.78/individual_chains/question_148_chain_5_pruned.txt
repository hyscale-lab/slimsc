Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple binary fluorides. Binary compounds mean two elements, so Y and F in each case. 

The substances mentioned are A1 to A5. Let's break down each part.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition releases fluorine, so maybe A1 is a compound that breaks down into something else and F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a fluoride with high oxidation state.

When a compound oxidizes xenon, it might be acting as an oxidizing agent itself. Fluorine in high oxidation states, like F in a -1 oxidation state, but wait, no. Fluorine usually has a -1 charge in compounds. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no. In terms of oxidation states, fluorine is usually -1, but in some cases, like in F2, it's 0. So when it's part of a compound, it's -1.

So A1 could be a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state. Because when it decomposes, it releases F2. So maybe A1 is a polyatomic fluoride, like YF3 or something, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, A2 has an ɷF of 31.96%. Wait, ɷF is the atomic weight fraction? Or maybe the mole fraction? Or perhaps it refers to the formula or something else. Wait, ɷ is the symbol for the mole fraction, I think. So 31.96% fluorine by mole. Hmm, that's an interesting number. Wait, fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19 g/mol. Let me calculate what that would mean.

If the mole fraction of F is 0.3196, and assuming that A2 is YFn, where n is some number. The mole fraction is (n * F
