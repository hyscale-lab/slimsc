Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and a calibration curve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my qPCR, but let me think it through.

So the scenario is that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it on serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means it's perfect—so each cycle halves the number of target molecules. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly, right? And the slope is -3.3. I think the slope relates to the efficiency and the calculation of the quantification cycle (Ct).

Looking at the Ct values, for each dilution, the triplicates are pretty close. Like, for 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So the average is around 34.2, with a variation of about 0.3. Similarly, other concentrations have similar tight ranges. So the technical replicates are consistent, which is good.

The question is about the discrepancies in the results. Wait, but the options are about possible explanations. So what's wrong here? Let me look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't be used for quantification. Well, the efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, which suggests the calibration curve is perfect. So why would they say qPCR can't be used? That seems unlikely. So probably not A.

Option B: Ct values don't align with target amount. But in this case, the data is perfect because R² is 1. So the Ct values are perfectly aligned. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, the slope is -3.3. Slope in qPCR is calculated as slope = log10(efficiency) * ln(10) or something like that. Wait, I think the formula for slope is related to the efficiency. Let me recall. The standard formula for a perfect qPCR (efficiency=100%) is that the slope should be -3.3219 (approximately -3.322), because log2(1
