Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, a certain keto acid when reacted with X produces a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, what's the violent reaction? Violent reactions could involve things like acid-base reactions, maybe something exothermic. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons? Or does each atom? Wait, the wording says "same number of neutrons and protons" in the molecule. No, wait, noâ€”the molecule itself. So molecule W has same number of neutrons and protons in total? Or each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons? No, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me think: if the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons, that would mean the sum of all neutrons equals the sum of all protons in the molecule.

Wait, maybe it's that each molecule has a molecule where each atom's protons equal its neutrons. But that's a different scenario. Alternatively, the molecule could be something like H2O, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CO2 or something else, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, like for example, if it's H2O, the molecule has (H: 1p each, O:8p; so total protons would be 2*1 + 8 =10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8, so 8. 10 vs 8, not same. Hmm. Maybe CO2? CO2 has C (6p,6n) and O (8p,8n each). Wait, in CO2, each O has 8p, 8n. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8=22. Oh! So the molecule CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits. So gas W is CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. So that's a possibility. So gas W is carbon dioxide.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O. Let's see. H2O molecule: 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n).
