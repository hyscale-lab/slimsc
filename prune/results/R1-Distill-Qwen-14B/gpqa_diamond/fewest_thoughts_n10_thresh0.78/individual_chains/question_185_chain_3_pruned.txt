Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. Let me think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε * σ · n. Hmm, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh wait, so σ · n is the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the vector n. I remember that when you take the dot product like that, it results in a matrix. Let me think: each Pauli matrix σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices, right? So σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. That might be important later.

Now, the Hamiltonian H is this operator multiplied by ε. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But since ε is a constant with energy dimensions, the eigenvalues should have energy dimensions too.

I need to find the eigenvalues of H. For any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0.

But wait, H is a 2x2 matrix because it's a combination of Pauli matrices, which are 2x2. So the eigenvalues are going to be two values.

Pauli matrices have a property that when you have σ · n, the trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the sum would also have trace zero. And the determinant: each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, but when you take σ · n, the determinant would be (n_x^2)(-1) + ... wait no, that's not right. Actually, the determinant of a matrix like σ · n is -1 because (σ · n)^2 = I, because each Pauli matrix squared is identity, and the cross terms cancel due to n being a unit vector.

Wait, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Let me expand that. Each σ_i squared is I (times 1), and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, which for i≠j is 2iε_{ijk} σ_k. But when you multiply out (σ · n)^2, the cross terms would involve terms like n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x). But σ_x σ_y = iσ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -iσ_z. So their sum is zero? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. σ_i σ_j = i ε_{ijk} σ_k, and when i≠j, σ_j σ_i = -σ_i σ_j. So when you have (σ · n)^2, the cross terms would be n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i) = n_i n_j (2 δ_{ij}) I ) because σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_{ij} I. Wait, because when i=j, σ_i σ_j = I, else?
