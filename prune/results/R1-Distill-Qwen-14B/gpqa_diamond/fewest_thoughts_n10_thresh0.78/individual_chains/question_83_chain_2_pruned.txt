Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should produce the acetate ion. 

The problem says we start with 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution. 

The initial moles of acetic acid must be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M times 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) equals 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles, so the new concentration is moles divided by new volume. That would be 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

First, I'll tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The amount of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid initially. Let me calculate the volume of NaOH needed. 

Moles of acetic acid are 0.001 as before. The molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (L) is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence, it's when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Now, what's the solution at equivalence? The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, we'll have sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base. The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions. The total solution volume at equivalence is the initial 40 cm³ (from the diluted acetic acid) plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So 50 cm³ total, which is 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001, same as initial moles of acetic acid. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction for acetate is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.
The Kb for this can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the Kb expression. Since Kb is small, I can use the approximation that [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. 

Then, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have that. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Kb. Let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kw is 1e-14, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. That seems right.

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise calculation. Let me write it out:

Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Hmm, so sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73 

C) 4.73; 7.00

D) 4.57; 6.92 

Hmm, none have 9. So perhaps I messed up something. Oh wait, maybe the initial equivalence point calculation is wrong.

Wait, no, the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. I had 0.001 moles of acetic acid, so 0.001 moles of NaOH needed. At 0.1 M, that's 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Then, the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, 0.05 L. So acetate concentration is 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, maybe I should consider the exact calculation without approximation. So let's set up the equation. Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Let x be [OH^-]. 

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) as before. So
