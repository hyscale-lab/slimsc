Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the question gives some key points about each spectrograph's capabilities. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. Oh right, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So anything with V mag less than or equal to 16 can be seen by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can go a bit fainter, up to 17.

So the task is to find which stars are bright enough to be detected by both. Wait, no, the question says which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So it must meet the criteria for both.

Wait, but wait. No, the stars are at different distances, so their apparent magnitudes will vary. Oh right! Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude they would have at 10 pc. So to find the apparent magnitude, I need to compute it for each
