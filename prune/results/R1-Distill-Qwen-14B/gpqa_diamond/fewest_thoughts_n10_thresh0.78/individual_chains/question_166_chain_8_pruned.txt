Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.

The Lagrangian given has several terms. Let me parse it. There's an i times the conjugate of N_R gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which looks like a Dirac term for a fermion. Then there's a term with (partial^mu phi)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar field phi. The next term is |D^mu S|^2, which is the covariant derivative squared for the scalar S. That suggests S is a charged field since D includes gauge interactions.

Then there are some interaction terms. The term with y_i over 2 times phi times the conjugate of N_iR and N_iR. Wait, N is a singlet, so maybe this is a Yukawa coupling? And then another term g_iα times N_iR and L_α S. L_α is a lepton doublet, probably. So this looks like a Dirac mass term for the neutrinos because S is a scalar—could be giving mass via S.

Then the potential V(phi, S, H). Wait, but in the given terms, H isn't mentioned. Oh, wait, maybe H is another field in the potential. Because the potential typically has terms involving the fields and their squares, etc. So perhaps H is another scalar field, maybe in a doublet? Because S is a scalar doublet, and phi is a singlet.

Given that, the question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons usually come from spontaneous symmetry breaking. So I need to think about what fields are getting VEVs here.

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) is given as ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², and ⟨phi⟩ = x, ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, but phi is a singlet scalar, so maybe h is another field? Or perhaps phi is the same as h? No, phi is a singlet, while h is the Higgs field, which is a doublet perhaps. Wait, in the Standard Model,
