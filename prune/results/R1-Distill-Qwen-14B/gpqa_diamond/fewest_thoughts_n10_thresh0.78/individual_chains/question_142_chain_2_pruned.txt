Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, right? They are used in quantum mechanics to describe the statistical state of a system, especially when it's mixed or in a superposition.

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where each point on the sphere corresponds to a different quantum state. The state is represented by a vector r = (x, y, z), with the components corresponding to the angles theta and phi, I think.

So, each density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix and σ represents the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz). The vector r is the Bloch vector, which gives the position on the Bloch sphere.

Let me write down the given ρ:

ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

Wait, |0⟩ is (1,0) and |1⟩ is (0,1). So |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0 on the diagonal, and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0,1. Adding them together gives a matrix that's [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

So ρ is (I + r·σ)/2. Let's equate that. So (I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2. If I multiply both sides by 2, I get I = I + r·σ. Subtract I from both
