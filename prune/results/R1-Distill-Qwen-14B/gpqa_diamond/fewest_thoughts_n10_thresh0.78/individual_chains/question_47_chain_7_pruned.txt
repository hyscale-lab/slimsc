Okay, I've got this problem here about identifying an organic compound based on spectroscopic data. Let's see what I can figure out. So the compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. 

The question gives me IR and 1H NMR data. Let's start with the IR. The peaks at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Since they're in the medium to strong intensity, maybe it's an amide or something with an -NH group. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. 

Now looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm with 3H. That sounds like a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet would come from two neighboring protons, so maybe the ethyl is connected to an oxygen, like an ethoxy group. 

Then there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm with 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, the formula only has one N. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2- group, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. 

Next, a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Quartet means four peaks, so two neighboring groups. If this is next to an ethyl group, perhaps it's an OCH2CH2O structure? Or maybe an ethyl ester... Wait, if it's an ester, like OCO-O-R, the quartet could be the CH2 next to the oxygen. 

Then the aromatic region. At 7.0 ppm, a doublet for 2H, and another at 8.0 ppm, also a doublet for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in a para substitution, the protons are in two sets of doublets, each with two protons. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. 

Putting it together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions. One substituent could be an ethoxy group, given the triplet at 1.20 ppm. Then the other substituent would likely be something involving the carbonyl. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. So benzamide would have a CONH2 group. But wait, the formula seems to have one N. Benzamide has a CONH2, so that would account for two nitrogens, but the formula only has one. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. So if we have 3-ethoxy, that adds an O and a CH2CH3. Let's see: C7 + C2H5O = C9H12NO2? Wait, but our formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution on the benzamide, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. But again, that would have two N's. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check. The phenyl group is six carbons, 4-ethoxy adds a C2H5O. So the substituents would be OCH2CH3 and the formamide. Formamide is HCO-NR', where R' is the phenyl group. So the formula would be C7H5O (phenyl) + C2H5O (ethoxy) + HCONH- (that's C=O and NH). So the total would be C7 + C2 + C (from HCO) = C10? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The structure is O=CNH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formula would be C6H4O (4-ethoxyphenyl) plus O=C-NH. Wait, but the ethoxy is C2H5O. So the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (from formamide) = 9. Hydrogens: benzene has 4 H (since two substituents, each with 2 H in para), ethoxy has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2, but wait, ethoxy is OCH2CH3, which has 2*3=6 H? No, OCH2CH3 has 2 H on the OCH2 and 3 on CH3, that's 5 H. The formamide group is HCONH2, but wait, in N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the amide is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the formula: 

Phenyl: C6H5 (but in the 4-ethoxyphenyl, it's C6H4OCH2CH3). So that's C8H7O. Then the formamide adds HCONH-: that's (HCO) which is C1H1O, and NH attached to the phenyl. Wait, but the formula would be C6 (benzene) + C2 (ethoxy) + C1 (formamide) = C9. So the formula would be C9H? Let's count. 

Phenyl has 4 H (since two substituents), ethoxy has 5 H, formamide has 2 H from NH2? Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2, but in this case, one H is attached to N. So in the molecule, the substituents are Ph-OCH2CH3 and HCONH-. So the structure is OCH2CH3 at para position, and HCONH- at another position. Wait, but if both substituents are on the benzene, the formula would be C9H? Let me calculate. 

Ph-OCH2CH3 is C8H9O2. Then form
