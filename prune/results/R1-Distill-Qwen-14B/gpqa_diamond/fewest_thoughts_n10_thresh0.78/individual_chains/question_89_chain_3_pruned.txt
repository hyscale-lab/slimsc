Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy concepts.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation. This usually forms an alkene because the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond as the two halides leave.

So, the product after KOH heating would likely be an adamantane derivative with a double bond. The product is called 1, and the 1H NMR shows some specific peaks. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, but waitâ€”no, because 1720 is more like a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but the starting material was 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So, perhaps elimination forms a diene or a dienophile? Or maybe it's a ring-opening?

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. KOH in what conditions? Maybe it's an E2 elimination where the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So, the product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe not, maybe it's 1,2-diene? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the NMR spectrum of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That kind of looks like an -OCH2- group or maybe an -OCH2O- structure, but wait, that's more for ethers or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? But epoxides typically have protons in the 3-4 ppm range, and their integrating for 2H would make sense if it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a ketone adjacent to some CH2 group, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more in line with an ester or ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a molecule where two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH would eliminate HBr from each Br, leading to a double bond. So, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond between them. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene? But that doesn't explain the NMR shifts.

Wait, but if elimination forms a double bond, maybe it's 1,3-diene, but that's a conjugated diene. The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm for 2H.
