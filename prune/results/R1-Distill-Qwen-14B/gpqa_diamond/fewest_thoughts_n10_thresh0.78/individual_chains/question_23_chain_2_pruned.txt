Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. The options are four possible sets of products, labeled A to D.

Hmm, so I'm trying to remember what reaction this is. The starting material is an aryl ether with a substituent that's a but-3-en-1-yl group attached to oxygen. The structure is O-benzene connected to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So the substituent is a 3-en-1-yl group, meaning there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3 because the chain is numbered from the point of attachment. Let me visualize it: the substituent is (CH2CH2C(CH3)2) attached via the first carbon. No, wait, but the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 attached via the first carbon, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait no, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the substituent is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because but is four carbons, so 3-en would be between C3 and C4, but but-3-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? Or did I mix that up. Wait, actually, but-
