Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. Oh right! The formula I think I need is the mean proper lifetime (cτ), which is ħ divided by the total decay width (Γ). Because Γ is the total width, which includes all decay channels.

Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Because the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). Oh, right, that makes sense.

But since we're talking about the decay distance, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying, we have to multiply the lifetime by the velocity of the particle times the speed of light. Oh wait, wait. The formula is L = v * τ * c, where v is the velocity in terms of c. Or wait, maybe more accurately, the mean decay length L is c multiplied by βγ times τ, where β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it as the speed of the particle times its lifetime. But since
