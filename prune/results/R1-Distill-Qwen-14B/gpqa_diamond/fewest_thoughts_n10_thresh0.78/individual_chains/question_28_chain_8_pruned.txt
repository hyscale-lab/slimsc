Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The starting material is S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. Right, that's a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4. The configuration is S, which I should probably keep in mind for later steps.

First, it's treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine to form product 1. I remember that silyl chlorides are typically used to protect hydroxyl groups. Triethylamine is a base, probably to deprotonate or absorb the HCl generated. So, the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexenone would get converted into a silyl ether. So, product 1 would have an O-TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group where the OH was. That makes sense.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, right? These are used in conjugate additions, especially to enones. The cyclohexenone has a conjugated system, so the Gilman reagent would add to the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. The reagent adds its cuprate to the beta position. Wait, so the cyclohexenone is in a ring, so the enone is between C1 (the ketone) and C2 (the double bond). The addition would happen at C2? Or is the enone in a different position?

Wait, the starting compound is 4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. So the enone system is from C1 to C3. Hmm, I think the conjugate addition would add the cuprate at the gamma position, which in this case would be the C4? Wait, no. Let me think. The enone is between C1 (keto) and C2-C3 (double bond). So the alpha carbons are C2 and C1, but wait, in an enone, the conjugate addition (Michael addition) would add at the beta position relative to the ketone. So in this case, the ketone is at C1, and the double bond is C2-C3. The beta position would be C3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the enone is from C1 (keto) and C2 (double bond). So the carbonyl is at C1, and the conjugated double bond is between C2 and C3. So the enone is cyclohexenone. The conjugate addition would add the cuprate to the beta position, which is C3. Because the ketone is at C1, so the alpha is C2, beta is C3.

Ph2CuLi would add a benzyl group to the beta
