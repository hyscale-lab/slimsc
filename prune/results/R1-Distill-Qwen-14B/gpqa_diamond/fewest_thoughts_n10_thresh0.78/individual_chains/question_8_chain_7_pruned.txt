Alright, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

Okay, so the setup is about finding genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. They did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key here is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors regulate other genes, right? Also, the experiment tests whether the mutants are more sensitive (lower resistance) than wild type because they can't produce certain gene products.

The results are given as resistance percentages compared to the control (wild type is 100%). 

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → so the mutant is less resistant than wild type. So G1 is important, but not completely. 75% is a 25% reduction.
- g2: 0% → complete loss of resistance. That's a big deal. So G2's product is critical for resistance.
- g3: 50% → so G3's product contributes, but not as much as G2. Half resistance.
- g1g3: 10% → that's really low. Both g1 and g3 knocked out.
- g2g3: 0% → same as each alone for g2. Hmm, wait, g2 alone is 0%, and the double is also 0%. So maybe G3 doesn't add anything when G2 is already gone?
- g1g2: 0% → so both g1 and g2 knocked out. So in this case, resistance is completely gone.

Wait, so let's think about epistasis and gene interactions. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So an epistatic gene is one that acts upstream, perhaps in a pathway. If knocking out two genes leads to more severe phenotype than the sum of each, you might have an epistatic relationship.

So, considering the data:

First, the single mutants:

- g2 is the most severe (0%), so G2 must be a critical gene. It's possible that G2 is the transcription factor upstream of others because when it's knocked out, resistance is completely lost. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate other genes (like G1 or G3) that are involved in resistance.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% resistance. Since G2 is already a transcription factor, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. So if G2 is knocked out, G1's function doesn't matter because it's not being activated. Hence, the double mutant g1g2 is as bad as g2 alone. That makes sense because if G2 is a TF, turning on G1 and maybe G3, then without G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but then what about the other double mutants.

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So knocking out both G1 and G3 leads to worse resistance than either alone (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So together, they're only 10%, which is worse than either. Hmm, what does this mean? Maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their combined loss has a more severe effect. But how does that relate to their functions?

g2g3 is 0%. So either G3 is redundant with G2 or G3 is downstream. Because when you knock out both, you get the same as knocking out g2 alone. So maybe G3 is downstream of G2. So without G2, G3 can't function because it's not being activated. So in g2g3, the effect is same as g2, because G3 isn't active anyway.

Wait, but then what about g3 alone? It's 50% resistance, so G3 contributes but is
