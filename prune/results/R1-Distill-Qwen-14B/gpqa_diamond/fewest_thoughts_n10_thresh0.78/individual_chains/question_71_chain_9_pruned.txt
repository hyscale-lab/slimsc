Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's think. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right, the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, assuming it's a black body. The formula is T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π^2 * D^2 * (1 - a)) ) )^(1/4), but maybe a simpler version applies here. Oh wait, since all the planets have the same albedo, 'a' (the albedo) is the same for all, so we can ignore that in the ratio.

Another approach: The equilibrium temperature depends on the semi-major axis. The formula I think I should use is T = T_earth * ( (D / D_earth) )^(-0.5) * ( (L / L_earth) )^0.5. But wait, in this problem, the star's luminosity (L) is the same for all planets, right? Because they're orbiting the same star. So L cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the key factor is the distance from the star, which relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (D). So, P^2 ∝ D^3, or D ∝ P^(2/3).

Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes (D) between Planet_4 and Planet_2 will be (P4/P2)^(2/3). Once I have that, the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance ratio. Because equilibrium temperature scales as D^(-1/2). So T ∝ D^(-1/2), so T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3) * (P4/P2)^(1/6), wait no, let me think again.

Wait, let me structure this methodically.

Given:
Period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 through 5.

So, Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit (let's assume it's 1 year for simplicity).
Planet_2: P2 = 2 units.
Planet_3: P3 = 2.5 units.
Planet_4: P4 = 3.5 units.
Planet_5: P5 =5 units.

We need to find T4 / T2.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_star * ( ( L / (16 * π^2 * D^2 * (1 - a)) ) )^(1/4). Since L and (1 - a) are same for all, the ratio T4 / T2 will be (D2/D4)^(1/2). Because T is inversely proportional to D^0.5.

So, T4 / T2 = sqrt( D2 / D4 )

But D is proportional to P^(2/3) from Kepler's law. So D2 = (P2)^(2/3) * k, D4 = (P4)^(2/3) * k, where k is a proportionality constant.

Thus, D2/D4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3).

Putting it into T ratio:
T4 / T2 = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)

Because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), and (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3).

So, the ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me make sure. So:

T ∝ D^(-1/2), because T = [L (1 - a)/(16 π^2 D^2)]^(1/4) → T ∝ D^(-1/2).

So T4 is proportional to D4^(-1/2), T2 proportional to D2^(-1/2).

So the ratio T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2).

But D ∝ P^(2/3),
