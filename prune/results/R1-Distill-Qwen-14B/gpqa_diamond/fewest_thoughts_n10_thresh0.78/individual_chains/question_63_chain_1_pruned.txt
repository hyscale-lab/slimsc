Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule consisting of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of each atom (Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu), the bond length R = 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w = 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have vibrational and rotational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the next higher energy, which probably involves some transition between vibrational and rotational states.

Wait, but wait. The question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is a combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels account for the bond vibrations, unlike the rigid rotor which assumes the bond length is fixed. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the transition here.

So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). But sometimes for diatomic molecules, the lowest rotational state might be J=1 because J=0 isn't allowed due to the symmetry of the wavefunction, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, for a diatomic, the rotational partition function starts at J=0, so maybe the fundamental state is J=0, v=0. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the fundamental would be the next higher energy, which could either be the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1), whichever has a lower energy.

So I need to find which transition would require the least energy, because the photon's energy must match the energy difference. The photon with the least possible energy (longest wavelength) would be the one that causes the transition to the next state with the lowest energy.

Wait, no, the question says the molecule switches to the next
