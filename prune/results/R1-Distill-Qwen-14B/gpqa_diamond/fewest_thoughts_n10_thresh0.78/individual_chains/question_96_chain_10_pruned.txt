Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon, right? The formula I think is something like S = (A * k) / (4 * ħ * c^3) ), where A is the area, k is Boltzmann's constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Oh right, I think that's the right one.

The question gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. I'll need to find the radius of the event horizon first. Oh wait, the event horizon of a black hole is at the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². But since I don't have the mass, maybe I can find R from θ and d.

Oh right, the angular size θ in radians is approximately the size divided by the distance. So θ ≈ R / d. But θ is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians first. Let me calculate that.

θ = 10^-17 degrees. To radians, that's (10^-17) * (π / 180) radians. Let me compute that. 1
