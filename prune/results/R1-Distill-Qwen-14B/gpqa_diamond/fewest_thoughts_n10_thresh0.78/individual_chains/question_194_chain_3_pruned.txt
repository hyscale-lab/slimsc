Okay, so I have this problem about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states, each term is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, each spin can be either +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states for the system. I need to calculate the energy for each of these states and then sum up e^(-βE) for each.

Let me think about how the energies work. The energy depends on the products of the spins. So for each state, I'll need to compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, multiply by -J, and then plug that into the exponent.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 possibilities. Let's see: each spin is ±1, so each product S_iS_j will be 1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they're different.

The term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be thought of as the sum of the three pairwise products. Let me denote each product as follows:

Let's denote a = S1S2, b = S1S3, c = S2S3.

Then E = -J(a + b + c).

So the energy depends on the sum of a, b, c. Each a, b, c can be ±1. But how many states have a particular sum?

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute all possible combinations. Let me try that. Each spin can be +1 or -1. Let's list all 8 possibilities.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   a=1, b=1, c=1
   sum=3 → E = -J*3 → exponent is 3Jβ? Wait, no, the exponent is -βE. So E is -3J. So exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3Jβ. So the term is e^{3Jβ}.
