Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction. Wait, but we're being asked about their relative speed. Oh right, when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their speeds normally. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), right? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. So the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other would come from that formula.

Let me assign the variables. Let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. So, from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or vice versa. Wait, the problem says the relative speed, so it depends on whose frame we're considering. Hmm, but in relativity, the relative speed isn't symmetric, right? So I need to be careful about which one is which.

Wait, no, the formula is the same regardless of which direction you're considering. Let me think. If object B is moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame, and object A is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of B as seen from A's frame would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, no, actually, I might have that backwards. Let me get the formula straight. The formula for velocity of object B in the frame of A is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²) only when they are moving in opposite directions. But if they are moving in the same direction, then it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, no, actually, I think the general formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Let me confirm. Because if u and v are both in the same direction, then you subtract, but when you're adding velocities, you have to consider the direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the standard velocity addition formula: u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Yes, that's correct when you're moving from frame S (lab frame) to frame S' (A's frame), where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in this case, if astronaut A is moving at v=0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u=0.5c in the same direction as A, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)) → (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. But speed is positive, so it's 0.1428c. Hmm, that's approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Wait, but options have 0.14c as part of C and D. So that's one part of the solution.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so the energies would be gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 * 3m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute each gamma.

For astronaut A (v=0.6c):
v²/c² = (0.6)^2 = 0.36
1 - v²/c² = 0.64
sqrt(0.64) = 0.8
gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25

So energy of A = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (v=0.5c):
v²/c² = 0.25
1 - v²/c² = 0.75
sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660
gamma2 ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

Energy of B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 m c². That's close to option C's 5.96 mc².

So for the options, looking at the relative speed and the total energy: our calculation suggests relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and E is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:
Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.
Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I calculate the relative speed correctly? Because the problem says 'what will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?'. Oh, wait a second, the total energy of the system. So the system's energy is the sum of both energies, which is 2.5 + 3.464 = ~5.964, so 5.96 mc². So option C is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the relative speed is between the two, but perhaps I should have used the other way: velocity of A as seen from B. Let me check that.

If I compute the velocity of A as seen from B's frame, which is moving at 0.5c, then using the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait that's (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) → (0.1)/(0.7) c ≈ 0.1428c. So same as before, about 0.14c. So regardless of perspective, the relative speed magnitude is same? Or wait no, actually in relativity, the relative speed isn't symmetric. Wait, wait, is that true? Because the formula is symmetric when considering the inverse.

Wait, no, the relative speed of A as seen from B is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). If A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from B's frame, A's speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) ) → 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) → 0.1/0.7 c ≈ 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So in either way, the relative speed is 0.14c.

So the first part is 0.14c. The energy sum is 5.96 mc². So option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A moves at \( v = 0.6c \) and astronaut B moves at \( u = 0.5c \) in the same direction. Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is positive. Thus, the relative speed is approximately:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut A (\( 2m \), \( v = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut B (\( 3m \), \( v = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as the relative speed is not \( 1.1c \), and the total energy is not \( mc^2 \).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the relative speed is not \( 0.1c \), and the total energy is not \( 4.96m c^2 \).
- **Option C**: Correct, as the relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy is \( 5.96m c^2 \).
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the total energy is not \( 5m c^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
