Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is that someone did an experiment on white lupine plants to find genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They got three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

From the data, each single mutant's resistance is given as a percentage of the control (which is 100% resistant). The double mutants' resistances are also given. We know that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. The question is about figuring out the interaction between these genes based on the resistance levels.

The data points:
- g1: 75% (so 75% as resistant as wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The options are about which gene is the transcription factor, whether there's pleiotropy or gene redundancy, and which genes are epistatic to others.

Hmm. Let's think about what each of these terms means.

First, a transcription factor is a protein that helps turn on other genes. So if a gene is a transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent the expression of other genes it controls. So if G2 is the transcription factor, then the downstream genes (G1 and/or G3) would be affected.

Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, maybe it's about whether a gene's knockout affects multiple pathways or if the same gene product is used in multiple functions.

Gene redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than each alone. But if the double mutant is worse than either single, or perhaps the same as the worse one, that might suggest redundancy.

Epistasis is about the relationship between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes.' If gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutants can only be seen when gene A is functional. So if in the double mutant, the phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, that might indicate epistasis.

Wait, in terms of disease resistance, a lower percentage means the plant is more susceptible. So higher numbers are better (more resistant), lower are worse.

Looking at the data:

- g2 is the most susceptible (0%), so it's the most severe mutant. The double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%, same as g2. Hmm.

What about the others:

g1: 75% (so more resistant than g2 but less than wild-type).
g3: 50%, which is worse than g1.

In the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% (much worse than either single)
g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

So what can we infer?

Let me think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would disable both. So the resistance would depend on whether G1 or G3 are required.

Wait, but looking at g1, it's 75% which is better than g3's 50%. So the single mutants each have some effect, but not as bad as when combined.

Wait, so if G2 is the transcription factor, then it's involved in turning on other genes. So in the wild-type, G2 would activate G1 and G3. But if G2 is knocked out, then those downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't be expressed. So the plants would have lower resistance.

In the case of the double mutants, if both G1 and G3 are non-functional, perhaps the plant is even more susceptible. Let's see the data.

Wait, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. Hmm. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, it's as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G3 might be downstream of G2. Because if you knock out G2, you can't activate G3. So knocking out G3 in the already knocked-out G2 background doesn't make things worse—it's already as bad as possible.

Similarly, g1g2 is 0%—so same as g2. So knocking out G1 and G2 together is as bad as knocking out G2 alone. That suggests that G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is not working, then G1 doesn't matter—it's not expressed in the first place. So the phenotype is the same as when G2 is knocked out.

Wait, but in the g1 single mutant, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g2's 0%. So if G2 is the transcription factor for G1, then when G2 is knocked out, G1 can't be expressed, so the plant is more susceptible than when G1 is knocked out. Because in the g1 mutant, G2 is still working, so G3 might be active, providing some resistance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, that means G2's product is required to activate G1 and G3. So in a g2 knockout, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. So the phenotypes of g2 would depend on both G1 and G3.

In the data, g2 has 0% resistance. So without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. That suggests that both G1 and G3 are necessary for resistance, and G2 is required for their expression.

Wait, but if both G1 and G3 are required, then their double mutant (g1g3) would be even worse. But looking at the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) but not as bad as 0%. Hmm, that's interesting.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1, and G3 is downstream of G1, or something like that.

Wait, another approach: in genetic terms, if the double mutant's phenotype matches one of the single mutants, that suggests that the other gene is epistatic. Let's see.

For example, in the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the effect of g3 is masked when g2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G3. Because the presence of G2's knockout determines the phenotype, regardless of G3's status. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Similarly, the double mutant g1g2 has 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when G2 is knocked out, the presence of G1's knockout doesn't change the phenotype.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either alone. Which suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant; their functions are additive or synergistic. Because the double mutant is worse than each single, so their effects aren't overlapping (like redundancy would imply). Alternatively, perhaps they function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance.

But wait, the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So probably, G2 is the transcription factor here.

So if G2 is the transcription factor, it activates G1 and G3. So in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So the resistance would depend on the combined effect of G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the data, g2 has 0%, which is the worst. So without G2, the plant can't resist anthracnose at all. So perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for resistance, and G2 is the upstream TF that activates both.

But wait, in the single mutants, g1 is at 75%, which is better than wild-type (100%) but worse than g3 (50%). So that suggests that G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF, then in the g1 mutant, G2 is still present and can activate G3. So in g1, G3 is still active, giving 50% resistance. But in the data, g1 is at 75% resistance. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, so wait: if G2 activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both from being expressed. So the resistance would be lower than either single mutant.

But in the data, the g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So without G2, no resistance. But in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So when G1 is missing, but G2 is present, G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance? No, wait, that can't be. Because G3's single mutant is 50%.

Alternatively, maybe G2 activates G1, and G1 activates G3. So G2 → G1 → G3. So without G2, G1 isn't expressed, so G3 isn't either. Without G1, G3 isn't expressed. So, in that case, the double mutant g1g3 would have the same phenotype as each single, but that's not what the data shows. Because g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try another approach. Let's list the data:

Single mutants:

g2 → 0% (most severe)
g1 →75%
g3 →50%

Double mutants:

g1g2 →0%
g2g3 →0%
g1g3 →10%

Hmm. So the g1g3 double is worse than either single, but the other double mutants are as bad as g2.

So the key here is that when G2 is knocked out (g2), all other mutants that also lack G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are as bad as g2. But when you have a double mutant that doesn't involve G2 (g1g3), it's worse than either single.

This suggests that G2 is the most critical gene here. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed, and the resistance is zero. But when only G2 is present, G1 and G3 can be expressed.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So without G1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than without G3 (50%). So G1 must contribute more to resistance than G3.

If G2 is the TF, it's possible that G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can't be expressed either. But according to the data, g3's resistance is 50%, which is lower than g1's 75%. So that's confusing. Because if G1 is the TF for G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 wouldn't be expressed. But in the data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75% but not as bad as g2's 0%.

Wait, maybe G2 is the TF that activates both G1 and G3. So in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. In the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So without G1, the plant's resistance is determined by G3. But in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. That suggests that without G1, the plant is more resistant than without G3. So maybe G3 is less important than G1. Or perhaps G1 and G3 are involved in different pathways.

Wait, but in that case, why is the double mutant g1g3 only 10%? Because if G2 is still present, then G3 would be active in the g1 mutant, giving 75% resistance. But in the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So the plant can't express either, but G2 is still active. So how come the resistance is only 10%? That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates G1 and G3, but G1 is a transcription factor for another gene, say G4, which is involved in resistance. So without G1, G4 isn't expressed, leading to lower resistance. But without G3, maybe the resistance is based on other factors.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think about the epistasis.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of gene B's mutant is only seen when gene A is wild-type. If gene A is knocked out, then gene B's effect doesn't matter.

Looking at the data, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance as g2. So the presence of G1 or G3 in the double mutant doesn't change the phenotype. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect of G1 or G3's knockout is masked.

So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. That suggests that their functions are additive, meaning they contribute to resistance through separate pathways. So when both are knocked out, resistance is much lower.

So putting this together, G2 is a transcription factor that is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 may function in separate pathways, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype.

Looking back at the options, let's see which option matches this.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because the data suggests G2 is the TF, not G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Not sure about same promoter. Plus, the epistatic here is G2 to others.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but our analysis said G2 is epistatic to both. So this might not fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Wait, gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both doesn't make it worse than the worse single. But in our data, the g1g3 is worse than either, so it's not redundancy. So that's not it.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor. No, because the data points to G2 as the TF.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they are part of the same operon, which is more bacterial. In plants, genes usually don't have shared promoters. Also, the epistasis here is G2 over others.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean each gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure. But epistatic here would mean G1 is epistatic to G3, but the data shows that when G2 is knocked out, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. So more like G2 is epistatic to both.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. But redundancy implies that knocking out both doesn't change the phenotype beyond what either alone does. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either, so it's not redundancy.

So that leaves me thinking that maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that G2 is the transcription factor, and it's epistatic to both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out (g2), the resistance is 0%, which is the most severe. So any double mutant that includes g2 (g1g2, g2g3) will have 0% resistance, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

As for the g1g3 mutant, their combined knockout leads to 10% resistance. Since G2 is present, but both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So in this case, perhaps without G1 and G3, but with G2, the plant can still produce some resistance, but not much.

Wait, but if G2 is the TF for both G1 and G3, then without G2, neither is expressed. So in the g1g3 mutant, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 should be expressed. But in the data, the g1g3 mutant is 10%, which is lower than either single. That seems contradictory.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are both activated by G2, but they also have some independent functions. So without G1, the resistance is 75%, which is better because G3 is still present. Without G3, resistance is 50%, worse than G1 knockout. So in the g1g3 double mutant, both are missing, so the resistance is even lower (10%).

So this suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution to resistance when G2 is present. But when G2 is knocked out, both are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

So in this scenario, G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The single mutants g1 and g3 have some residual resistance because G2 is active and allows the other gene to function.

Now looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because G2 is not a TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (unlikely), G3 epistatic to G1. Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. Not sure about pleiotropy.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. No, because redundancy suggests that knocking both doesn't change the phenotype beyond the worse single. But g1g3 is 10%, worse than either, so not redundancy.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is Option A, but that can't be because it says G1 is the TF, which is not what the data suggests.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor. So perhaps G2 is the TF.

So the options that have G2 as the TF are A, B, C, D.

Let me reevaluate the options with G2 as TF.

Option A) G1 is TF – No, so wrong.

Option B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (doubtful), G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm.

Option C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. So G1 is epistatic to G3. But our data suggested that when G2 is present, G3's effect is more severe. Hmm, no. Let me think about epistasis.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g3 would only be seen when G1 is functional. So in the g3 mutant, if G1 is present, the plant would show the g3 phenotype. But in our data, the g3 mutant is 50%, which is worse than the wild-type, so that's the g3 phenotype. But the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1? I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: Epistatic relationships can be determined by the order of the pathway.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B. So if knocking out A masks the effect of knocking out B, then A is epistatic.

In the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10% which is worse than either. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Without G1, G3 can't compensate fully, and vice versa.

But when G2 is knocked out, all resistance is gone. So G2 is upstream of both.

So considering that, the correct conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3, which are perhaps in separate pathways. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is minimal (10%).

Looking at the options, which one says that?

Option A says G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter (unlikely), G3 epistatic to G1. Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but in this context, perhaps they're involved in separate traits but both contribute to resistance. Also, G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But since g1g3 is worse than either, that's not redundancy. So this can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what each option's conclusion is.

Looking at the options:

Option A:

G1 is a transcription factor. No, data suggests G2 is. So wrong.

Option B:

G2 is TF, G1 and G3 share promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If they share the promoter, that implies they are co-expressed, perhaps in the same operon. Unlikely in plants. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would mean that when G3 is knocked out, the phenotype depends on G1. But in the data, G3's single mutant is worse than G1, so not sure.

Option C:

G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy – each gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, perhaps both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. G1 being epistatic to G3 means that G3's effect is only seen when G1 is present. But when G1 is knocked out, the effect of G3's knockout is masked. So in the g3 mutant, with G1 present, resistance is 50% worse. But in the g1g3 mutant, resistance is 10%.

Alternatively, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1g3 mutant, the phenotype would be the same as g1 or g3, whichever is worse. But here, it's worse than both. So maybe this isn't the case.

Option D:

G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that knocking out both G1 and G3 has the same effect as knocking out the worse single. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, worse than either. So not redundancy.

Hmm. None of the options perfectly fit, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Let's think.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G3's function is only evident when G1 is present. So in the absence of G1, G3's effect can't be seen.

Looking at the data:

g3 is 50% resistance, worse than g1's 75%. So when G3 is knocked out, the resistance is worse than when G1 is. So if G3 is downstream of G1, then the absence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. But in the data, the g1 mutant is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps G3 is downstream of both G1 and G2. So if G2 is the TF, activating G1, which then activates G3. Then in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed → 0% resistance.

In the g1 mutant, G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. If G3 contributes to resistance, then the g1 mutant would have some resistance based on G3. In the data, g1 is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So that doesn't add up. Because if G3 is downstream of G1, then in g1, G3 can't be expressed, leading to lower resistance than when G3 is present.

Wait, but data shows that in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is better than g3's 50%. So that suggests that when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still active but provides less resistance than G1.

Hmm. Maybe G2 activates both G1 and G3, but G3 also requires G1 to be active. So without G1, G3 can't be expressed. So in the g1 mutant, G3 isn't expressed, so resistance is lower than wild-type but higher than g3's mutant. But according to the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both activated by G2. So without G2, both are inactive. Without G1, G3 is active but contributes less than when both are active. Without G3, G1 is active and contributes more. So in the g1g3 mutant, both are inactive, leading to minimal resistance.

So G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is the lowest.

In this case, which option aligns?

Looking at the options, perhaps option C is the right one. Let me read it again.

Option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, they don't show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. So maybe that's not the right term here.

Alternatively, gene redundancy would not fit because the double mutant is worse.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so not redundant), and when both are knocked out, the resistance is additive.

Looking at the options, none of them mention separate pathways. So the only option where G2 is the TF and the others are in some relationship is option C or D.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not redundant but additive. So option D says they show gene redundancy, which they don't. So that's not it.

So perhaps the correct option is option A, but I thought G1 wasn't the TF. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the question again, the conclusion is about which genes' interaction can you draw.

The data shows that G2 is the most critical gene, as all double mutants involving G2 are as bad as G2 alone. G1 and G3's combined knockout is worse than either alone, suggesting they contribute additively.

So the correct conclusion would be that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance (not redundant, not epistatic to each other in a way that masks the effect, but additive). So the options don't have an option that says this, but let's look again.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, not necessarily the same. But in this case, perhaps each affects resistance differently. So that's possible. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which would mean that G2's function is upstream, which aligns with it being a transcription factor.

So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking for which option says that. Let's see:

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the phenotype is worse than either, so that might not fit.

Wait, let's imagine that G2 is the TF, and in the absence of G2, all downstream effects are gone. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So which option says that G2 is the TF and is epistatic to others? Let me check the options.

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because G2 is not the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Unlikely.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3. So G2 is TF, but the epistatic here is G1 over G3, which perhaps doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3. No, because redundancy doesn't fit.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the options mean. Let's read option A again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But from the data, G2's knockout is the worst, so G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the correct option should have G2 as the TF, and G2 epistatic to others.

Now, looking at the options:

Only options B, C, D have G2 as the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter is unlikely. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would mean that when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's knockout is masked. But in the data, g3 is 50% and g1 is 75%. So without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. So that suggests that G3 is more critical than G1. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, the presence of G3 would mask the effect of G1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1, so when G3 is knocked out, the effect of G1's knockout is seen. But in the data, without G3, the resistance is 50%—which is worse than without G1 (75%). So that suggests that G3 is more important, so perhaps G3 is epistatic. Because without G3, the plant is worse than without G1.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the data.

Given that G2 is the TF and is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and that G1 and G3 contribute additively, I think the correct option is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the g3 mutant's phenotype would only be seen when G1 is present. But in the data, g3 is worse than g1, so that's not the case.

Perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's look for which option correctly identifies the epistatic relationships.

The data shows that g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3 because any double mutant with g2 has 0% resistance. So the epistatic gene is G2.

Now, looking for an option where G2 is the TF and is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. That doesn't fit the main epistatic relationship, which is G2 over G1 and G3.

So the correct option must have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to others.

Looking again:

Option A: G1 is TF, no.

Option B: G2 is TF, but says G3 is epistatic to G1.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, so not redundant. So D is out.

So perhaps the correct option is B: G2 is TF, same promoter (unlikely), G3 epistatic to G1. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are pleiotropic, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: which options have G2 as the TF and which have G2 as epistatic.

Only options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

The correct conclusion should be that G2 is the transcription factor, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, none directly state that. But option B says G3 is epistatic to G1, which doesn't align with G2 being the main epistatic gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another way to think: the double mutant g1g3 has resistance 10%, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are not redundant and their functions are additive.

So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so not redundant), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options, which one says that. Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy isn't about separate pathways; it's about a single gene affecting multiple traits. So that's not fitting.

Maybe the correct option is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3. But as discussed, g1g3 isn't redundant.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a transcription factor, but I thought G2 is the TF.

Wait, the data says that g2 is the most severe, which is 0%. If G2 were the TF, then without it, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance, which suggests that G1 can be expressed without G2, which would only be possible if G1 isn't downstream of G2. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and G2 isn't the TF.

Wait, that's a possibility. Maybe G1 is the TF.

If G1 is the TF, then it activates other genes, including G2 and G3. So in the g1 mutant, neither G2 nor G3 can be expressed. So the resistance would be low.

But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance, which is better than the wild-type (100%)? No, 75% is worse than wild-type. Wait, the control is 100%, so the mutants have lower percentages.

Wait, if G1 is the TF, then in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 can't be expressed. So the plant can't resist the disease as well. So g1 would have lower resistance than the wild-type. But in the data, g1 is 75% which is lower than 100%, so that's possible.

But g2 is 0%, which is worse than g1. So if G2 is downstream of G1, then in g2, G1 is active, but G2 isn't, leading to lower resistance than in wild-type.

Wait, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should try to build a pathway.

Option A says G1 is the TF. So G1 activates downstream genes, perhaps G2 and G3.

So in g1, neither G2 nor G3 is expressed. So the resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild-type.

In the g2 mutant, G1 is active, so G2 is not expressed, but G3 is. So the resistance would be based on G3. If G3 is less important than G2, then g2 might be worse than g1, which aligns with the data (g2 is 0%, worse than g1's 75%).

Wait, but in the data, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So perhaps without G3, the resistance is worse than without G2.

Hmm. Let's try to model this.

If G1 is the TF, activating G2 and G3.

- Wild-type: G1, G2, G3 all active → 100% resistance.

- g1 mutant: G1 not active → G2 and G3 not active → resistance 75%.

- g2 mutant: G2 not active → G1 and G3 active → resistance based on G3 and G1? But if G2 is a downstream gene, perhaps it's involved in another step.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor as well, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is the TF for G2, which is the TF for G3.

So G1 → G2 → G3.

In this case:

- g1: G2 and G3 not expressed → resistance 75%.

- g2: G3 not expressed → resistance 0% (because G2 is needed for G3).

- g3: G3 not expressed → resistance 50% (maybe via G1 and another pathway).

But in the data, g3 is 50% resistance, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that suggests that without G3, the plant is more susceptible than without G2. But according to the pathway, without G2, G3 isn't expressed either, so g2 and g3 should have the same resistance. But in the data, g2 is 0% and g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the pathway is different.

Wait, maybe G1 and G2 are both TFs, and G3 is a downstream gene.

So G1 activates G3, and G2 also activates G3.

In that case, G3 is downstream of both G1 and G2.

So in the g1 mutant: G2 can still activate G3 → resistance based on G3. Let's say G3's resistance is 50%, so g1's resistance is 50%. But in the data, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G2 each activate separate downstream genes, say G4 and G5, which are involved in resistance. But this is getting too speculative.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the data, the most plausible conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. So when G2 is knocked out, both are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. The double mutants without G2 are as bad as G2 alone. The double mutant without G2 and another gene doesn't get worse than G2. But the double mutant of G1 and G3 is worse than either alone, suggesting they're additive.

Looking at the options, the only one that mentions G2 as the TF is options B, C, D.

Option C says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, which suggests they are additive, not epistatic. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one, where G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But since the double mutant is worse, it's not redundancy.

I think the correct answer is option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So their combined knockout is worse than either alone, which is what the data shows.

In this case, the correct option would be that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (not redundant, additive). But none of the options explicitly state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I thought G2 was the TF.

Wait, another possibility: since g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for a certain function, but their presence alone isn't sufficient. So they are in the same pathway, and knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype. But this doesn't fit with the other data.

I think I've spent enough time, and I need to make a decision. The data suggests that G2 is the TF and is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the correct option should reflect that.

Looking at the options, option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. But the main epistatic gene is G2, so perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the best fit is option C.

Wait, no. Another approach: the order of epistatic genes.

If in the double mutant g1g2, the phenotype is same as g2, then G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, in g2g3, same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3.

So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Which option says G2 is the TF and is epistatic to others?

Only option B and C have G2 as TF.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1. No, because G2 is epistatic.

So perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll have to go with option C, even though it's not a perfect fit.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants contributing to resistance against anthracnose. The data provided shows the resistance levels of single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key observations are:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - g1: 75% resistance (worse than wild-type but better than g2 and g3).  
   - g2: 0% resistance (most severe mutant).  
   - g3: 50% resistance (worse than g1 but better than g2).  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - g1g2: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - g1g3: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - g2g3: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

### Key Analysis:
- **G2 as the transcription factor (TF)**:  
  The data strongly suggests that G2 is the transcription factor. In the g2 mutant, resistance is 0%, indicating that G2 is critical for activating downstream genes. Additionally, all double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means that without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can contribute to resistance.

- **G1 and G3 contributions**:  
  The single mutants g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) suggest that both genes contribute to resistance, but G1 is more critical than G3. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating that G1 and G3 are additive in their contributions to resistance when G2 is functional.

- **Epistatic relationships**:  
  The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 having the same resistance as g2 confirm that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This aligns with G2 being the upstream transcription factor. The double mutant g1g3 being worse than either single mutant suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways or contribute independently to resistance.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that G1 is the transcription factor, which contradicts the data showing that G2 is the most critical gene (g2 has 0% resistance).  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 share the same promoter is unlikely (promoters are typically gene-specific in plants). Additionally, G3 being epistatic to G1 does not align with the data, as G2 is the primary epistatic gene.  
- **Option C**: Partially correct. G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (contributing to resistance in separate or additive ways). However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, indicating additive, not epistatic, relationships.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy is invalid, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy. Additionally, G1 being epistatic to G3 is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The data supports that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance when G2 is functional. Among the options, **Option C** is the closest fit, as it correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and G1 and G3 as having pleiotropic effects, even though the claim about G1 being epistatic to G3 is not fully supported by the data.

**Answer: C**
