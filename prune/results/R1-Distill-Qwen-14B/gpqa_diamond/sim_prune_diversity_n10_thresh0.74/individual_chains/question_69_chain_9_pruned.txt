Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me read through it again. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, right? So when a particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. The observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh, right, because gamma = E / (m c²), but since we're working in units where c=1, probably E in GeV and mass also in GeV, so gamma would just be E/m.

So the energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.918. So gamma is about 7.92.

So the observed lifetime τ = gamma * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s, so τ is 7.918 * 8e-16. Let me compute that: 7.918 *8 is around 63.344, so 63.344e-16 seconds. That's 6.3344e-15 seconds. 

Now, the next part is about the minimum resolution needed. I think this refers to the time resolution of the detector. Because to observe a decay, the detector has to be able to measure the time difference between the decay and the tracks. The resolution needs to be good enough so that the decay is detected within a certain time window. 

Wait, the question is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the probability of observing a decay is related to the ratio of the detector's time resolution (Δt) to the mean lifetime (τ). The probability P is approximately 1 - e^(-Δt/τ). Wait, no, P is the fraction of decays observed. So if the decay happens, the time between the production and decay is τ. If the detector can't resolve a time difference smaller than Δt, then the chance it's missed is lower.

Alternatively, the probability of observing the decay is P = 1 - e^(-Δt / τ). So we want P ≥ 0.3. So 1 - e^(-Δt/τ) ≥ 0.3 → e^(-Δt/τ) ≤ 0.7 → -Δt/τ ≤ ln(0.7) → Δt ≥ - τ * ln(0.7). Let me compute ln(0.7). Ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667. So the equation becomes Δ
