Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. The options give different products for each, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me recall what the Michael reaction is. The Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and the alpha carbon becomes the new site of the carbonyl. This forms an enolate intermediate.

Starting with part A: the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH. So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl acetal of malonic acid. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. 

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-OEt, where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OEt, but with substituents. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO-OEt? Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, the formula for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCO-OEt? Or maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OEt. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be in the middle. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the substituent on carbon 3. So maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, the
