Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The larger the parallax, the closer the star is, right? Wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Oh right, because the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax (in arcseconds). So if plx is 0.001 arcseconds, the star is 1000 parsecs away.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So like, how does the count of stars change as we look at different parallax ranges.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that their actual density in space is uniform. Wait, but when we observe them, the distribution in the sky depends on how we're seeing them. Because more nearby stars will have larger parallaxes, but the volume of space increases with distance, so the number of stars in a shell at distance d depends on the volume and the density. 

Wait, let's model this. Assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space with a density ρ (number per cubic parsec). Then, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is approximately 4π d² ρ dr. Because the volume of the shell is 4π d² dr, and multiplied by density gives the number. 

But parallax plx is 1/d. So plx = 1/d → d =1/plx. The change in parallax, let's say we want to find N, the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx. Wait, I think I need to express d in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. 

Let me think about how to change variables from d to plx. So d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, because plx = 1/d → dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So when d increases, plx decreases.

So the number of stars in a thin shell is 4π d² ρ dr. Substitute d = 1/plx → 4π (1/plx)^2 ρ
