Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's movement towards and away from us. 

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key difference here is the shift in their spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. 

Wait, what's a milliangstrom? Oh right, 1 milliangstrom is 1e-3 angstroms. But I'm not sure if I need to convert units here. Maybe the shift relates to the velocity of the star.

The RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula I think is v = (λ shift) / λ * c, where c is the speed of light. But wait, for small shifts, we can approximate v ≈ (Δλ / λ) * c. But actually, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. 

But in this problem, the shifts are given, and I think the key is that K is proportional to the Doppler shift. Since the stars are the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), perhaps the velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the planetary mass and the orbital period and other factors. But wait, I think the main relation is that K is proportional to (M sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ), but since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K is proportional to M_planet / (M_star^(1/3)). But in this problem, both planets have the same mass (like Neptune), and both stars have the same mass. So K should be the same for both planets? But that doesn't make sense because the observed shifts are different. Hmm, wait no. The observed Doppler shift is directly the velocity semi-amplitude K. So in the problem, the shift is 5 and 7 milliangstroms, which presumably correspond to K1 and K2, the velocities of the stars.

Wait, but the shift depends on how much the star moves. So a larger shift means a higher K. So in this case, Planet #2 (7 ma) has a higher K than Planet #1 (5 ma). 

But how does K relate to the orbital period? I remember the RV method equation which connects K to the planetary parameters. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ] * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / sin i )
