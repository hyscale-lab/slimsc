Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stars with spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed, which could mimic an exoplanet. Hmm, let's break it down.

So the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Oh wait, but the Sun's radius is like about 1 million kilometers or something. Anyway, the star has a hemisphere covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, wait. No, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So I think that means that, in the hemisphere that's spotty, 20% of the entire star's surface is covered. Because a hemisphere is half the surface, so 20% of a hemisphere would be 10% of the whole star? Or maybe the filling factor is per hemisphere. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's see. The star's total surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.20 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR², and the entire star's surface is 4πR², so the spot coverage is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface. Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, so I think that's correct.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K,
