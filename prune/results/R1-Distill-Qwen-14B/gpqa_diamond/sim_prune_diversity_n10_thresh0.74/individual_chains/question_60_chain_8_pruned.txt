Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the astronaut traveling to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. Hmm, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, I remember something about time dilation in relativity. Oh right, when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down for the traveler compared to someone watching from a distance. So, the astronaut's experienced time, the proper time, is shorter than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, the question asks for the time from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I think I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not exactly sure about the exact distance, but I recall that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me pick an approximate value, like 160,000 light-years for calculation purposes.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Oh, maybe I don't need the actual distance because the options are given. Wait, no, I think I do need to calculate the time taken from Earth's frame and then apply time dilation.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to consider the distance and calculate the time experienced by the astronaut. Let me think.

So, the distance D is roughly 160,000 light-years. The speed v is 0.99999987c. So, the time from Earth's frame (t) would be D divided by v. Wait, but D is in light-years and v is a fraction of c. So, t (in years) would be D / v.

Wait, let me do the units: D is 160,000 light-years. v is 0.99999987c. So, in terms of light-years per year, because c is 1 light-year per year. So, D/(v) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 ≈ 160,000 years, but wait that can't be right because v is so close to c. Wait, no, because 0.99999987 is almost 1, so the time from Earth's perspective is about 160,000 years. But the astronaut's lifetime is only 150 years, but wait, the astronaut is 22 and his average lifetime is 150, so he's got about 128 years left from Earth's view. But wait, that's not considering relativity.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The astronaut's own lifetime is 150 years, but in their own frame, they might age less due to time dilation. So, the question is, does the trip take longer than the astronaut's lifespan?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let's think. The distance is D in light-years, and the speed is 0.99999987c. So, the time from Earth's frame is D / v ≈ D / 1. So, for D=160,000 ly, t=160,000/v years. But v is 0.99999987c, so v is about 0.99999987 ly/year.

So, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. But wait, that's from Earth's perspective. The astronaut is moving at that speed, so their time is shorter.

The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time τ) is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because time dilation factor is gamma inverse (tau = t / gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

But wait, wait, another approach: the proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, the formula for proper time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), because when the object is moving at speed v, the time experienced is less.

So let's compute that. Let me compute v²/c². v = 0.99999987 c, so v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². So (v²)/(c²) = (0.99999987)^2.

Calculating that: 0.99999987 squared is approximately let's see. Let me compute 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So, (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small. Wait, but 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. Let me compute (1 - a)^2 ≈ 1 - 2a for small a. So, (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1 - 2.6e-7. So, 1 - (v²/c²) ≈ 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4. Because sqrt(2.5e-7) is about 5e-4, since 5e-4 squared is 25e-8=2.5e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=approximately 0.00051.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is t * 0.00051.

From Earth's frame, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years (since 0.99999987 is so close to 1, we can approximate as 1 for t calculation, but perhaps that's a bad approximation. Wait, wait, let me be precise.
