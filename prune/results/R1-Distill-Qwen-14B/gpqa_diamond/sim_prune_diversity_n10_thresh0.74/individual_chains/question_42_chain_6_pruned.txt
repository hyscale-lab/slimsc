Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to recall.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for calculating the orbital period. Maybe it just tells us that their orbits are being observed and measured accurately.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, Temperature1 / Temperature2 ≈ 1.4 and Temperature2 / Temperature3 ≈ 2.3. Hmm, I should probably write down these ratios.

Then, the masses are given: the mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Mass1/Mass2 ≈1.15 and Mass2/Mass3≈1.35. Wait, so Mass1 is 1.15 times Mass2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the ratio is Planet1 to Planet2. So if it's 1.15, then Planet1 is 1.15 times the mass of Planet2. So Mass1 = 1.15 * Mass2. Similarly, Mass2 = 1.35 * Mass3, because Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35, meaning Mass2 = 1.35 * Mass3. So, putting it together, Mass1 = 1.15 * (1.35 * Mass3) = (1.15 *1.35) * Mass3. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35. Well, 1.15 *1 =1.15, 1.15*0.35=0.4025, so total 1.5525. So Mass1/Mass3 = 1.5525. So Mass3 is about 1/1.5525 times Mass1, which is approximately 0.6447 * Mass1. But maybe that's not directly needed yet.

The question asks about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So I need to find Period3 / Period1.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis).

Wait, but since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), and assuming they orbit the same star (so L is the same), the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance D. So T is proportional to sqrt(D)^(-1/2), because T is proportional to (1/D)^0.25. Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/D)^(1/4). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(1/4) = T1/T2. Wait, because T is inversely proportional to D^(1/4). Wait, because T is proportional to D^(-1/4). So T1 = L^(1/4) * (1/(16 π σ))^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) * D1^(-1/4). So T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/4) * (other factors which are the same, so cancels out).
