Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. 

Wait, wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but I'm a bit confused because phosphate ions can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The phosphate ion can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. So, the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2-.

The given data includes the molecular weights: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I can use standard conditions for calculations.

The acid dissociation constants (Ka1, Ka2, Ka3) for H3PO4 are given as 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8, and 1.8x10^-12. Hmm, so these are the dissociation steps:
H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, the first thing I think I need to do is calculate the moles of each salt in the solution.

Let me calculate moles for KH2PO4 first. The formula is KH2PO4. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So, moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00733 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1.00 divided by 136.09. Let's see, 136.09 goes into 1.00 about 0.00733 times. Yeah, 0.00733 mol.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Wait, wait, what's the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O? Oh, right, it's sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. But when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ ions, one HPO4^2- ion, and some water molecules, which don't affect the concentration of ions we're considering.

So both salts, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, contribute to the same HPO4^2- ion concentration. So when they dissolve in water, they release HPO4^2- ions.

Wait, but wait a minute. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Let's think about what it dissociates into. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of that salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-. So I need to find the total moles of HPO4^2- in the solution.

Wait, but wait. How does that work? Because H2PO4^- can further dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+. So, the presence of H2PO4^- will contribute to the HPO4^2- concentration through the second dissociation step.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts, but because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-, the actual concentration
