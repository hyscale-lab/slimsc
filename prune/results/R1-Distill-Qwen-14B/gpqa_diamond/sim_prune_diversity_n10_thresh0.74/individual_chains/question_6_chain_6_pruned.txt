Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The problem states that the potential V(r, θ) is given by (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, so that's V(r,θ)=½k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember that in polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be broken down into radial and angular parts, which would make solving the Schrödinger equation easier by separation of variables. But wait, let me think about the form here.

Alternatively, maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that resembles something familiar, like a harmonic oscillator or another known potential. Let me try to manipulate the expression. Let me factor out r² and k/2:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because ½k r² is (k/2) r², and (3/2)k r² cos²θ is (3k/2) r² cos²θ. So combining terms, it's (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, 1 + 3 cos²θ can be written as 3 cos²θ + 1. Alternatively, maybe using a trigonometric identity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can express this in terms of a shifted
