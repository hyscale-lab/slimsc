Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying the number of 13C-NMR signals in compound E, which is the end product of a series of reactions. The starting material is propionaldehyde, and it goes through several reaction steps. Each step probably changes the structure in some way, and I need to figure out what E looks like to determine its NMR signals.

Let's list out the reactions step by step:

1. Propionaldehyde reacts with EDT and BF3 to give compound A.
2. A reacts with BuLi to give B.
3. B reacts with bromoethane to give C.
4. C undergoes a HgCl2, H2O, and H+ reaction to form D.
5. D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E.

I'll need to figure out each structure step by step.

Starting with propionaldehyde: that's CH3CH2CHO. Its structure is an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to a two-carbon chain.

First reaction: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3. Hmm, EDT is probably ethyl diethyl tin, which is a reagent used in the Wittig reaction. BF3 is a catalyst often used in such reactions. So the Wittig reaction takes an aldehyde or ketone and converts it into an alkene. So propionaldehyde (which is an aldehyde) would react to form an alkene. The Wittig reaction would replace the O of the aldehyde with a CH2 group, so propionaldehyde (CH2CH2CHO) would become CH2=CHCH2O... wait, no, wait. Wait, the Wittig reaction takes the aldehyde O and replaces it with a double bond. So propionaldehyde (RCHO) becomes RCH2CH2– but wait, no, wait. The general Wittig reaction is R2C=O + Wittig reagent (like Ph3P=CHR') → R2C=CHR' + Ph3PO and other byproducts.

Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So when the Wittig reagent (EDT, which is maybe a triethyltin derivative) reacts with it, the aldehyde becomes an alkene. So the product A would be CH2=CHCH2... Wait, wait, no. Let me be more precise.

The Wittig reaction converts an aldehyde into an alkene. The aldehyde group (CHO) becomes CH2. So, for propionaldehyde, which is CH3CH2CHO, the product A would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, propionaldehyde is propanal: CH3CH2CHO. When you perform a Wittig reaction on propanal, you would add a methylene group (CH2) to the carbonyl. So the aldehyde becomes CH2, and the adjacent group becomes CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the Wittig reaction converts RCHO into RCH=CH2? No, wait. No, the product would be RCH₂–CH₂? Wait, no. Let me think. The general Wittig reaction for an aldehyde RCHO would form RCH₂–CH₂– something? No, wait, the aldehyde (CHO) is transformed into CH₂– group, but actually, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So for RCHO, the product is RCH₂–CH₂–? No, wait. For example, for formaldehyde (CHO), the Wittig would give CH₂=CH₂ (ethylene). For acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), the product would be CH2=CHCH3 (propene). So for propanal (CH3CH2CHO), the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait: propanal is CH3CH2CHO. So the aldehyde is at the end. The Wittig would take the carbonyl (CHO) and add a CH₂ group. So propanal → (CH2)2CH2? No, wait, the product should be propene, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanal has structure CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig reagent would attack the carbonyl, forming a new double bond. The product
