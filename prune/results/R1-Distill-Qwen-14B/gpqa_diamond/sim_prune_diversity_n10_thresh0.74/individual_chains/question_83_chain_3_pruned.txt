Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the volume doubles. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. Oh wait, volume should be in liters. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. 

Moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH at equivalence will depend on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

But before that, let's handle the 25% titration point. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's calculate the moles at that point.

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from before). 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So NaOH has added 0.00025 moles of OH- which react with the acetic acid. 

After the reaction, the moles of CH3COOH left will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, what about the volume at this point? The total solution volume is the original 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which might be easier.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). At 25% titration, the moles of A- and HA can
