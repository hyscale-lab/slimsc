Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. They observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, but some made it through the mucus in the intestines to the secondary lymphoid organs. Then, they found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene showed high variability. So what process is happening here?

Wait, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're like little masses in the intestinal wall that help sample the gut contents for antigens. So when the GFP-tagged proteins reach there, they're probably being taken up by immune cells.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene... Oh, that sounds like something to do with antibody diversity. The variable regions of antibodies are crucial for recognizing specific antigens, and their diversity comes from a few processes.

I think about the processes involved in antibody production. There's VDJ recombination, which happens during the formation of B cells in the bone marrow. VDJ recombination combines V, D, and J segments to create the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during early B cell development. But wait, I also remember that after the initial diversification, there's another process called somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation occurs in activated B cells, especially in germinal centers, which leads to further diversification of the antibody variable regions. So this would increase the variability even more.

In this experiment, the cells isolated are proliferating. Peyer's patches have these structures, and when an antigen is present, B cells get activated and proliferate. During this proliferation, especially in germinal centers, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions, leading to different antibody specificities. So the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences would be due to this process.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation – this is about introducing mutations after the initial VDJ setup. That fits.

B) Complement activation – that's about the complement system's role in immune response, maybe causing lysis of pathogens. Not directly related to the variability in the gene.

C) Class switching recombination – that's when the antibody changes its class (like from IgM to IgG), which happens after the variable region is set. So it doesn't affect the variable regions' variability.

D) VDJ recombination – that's the initial setup in the bone marrow, creating the initial diversity. But if the cells are already mature and in the Peyer's patches, maybe they've already undergone VDJ, so they wouldn't do it again. Plus, the question's about high variability after exposure, suggesting a process that happens upon antigen encounter.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence is observed in the Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. These patches sample antigens from the gut and initiate immune responses. The isolated proliferating cells from the Peyer's patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain gene sequences.

This variability is indicative of a process that diversifies antibody specificities. VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of the variable regions. However, the question describes a scenario where B cells are already mature and have encountered an antigen, leading to proliferation and further diversification. This suggests the involvement of somatic hypermutation, a process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of antibodies during the activation and proliferation of B cells in germinal centers. This process increases the diversity of the immune response.

Complement activation (option B) is unrelated to the variability in the variable heavy chain gene. Class switching recombination (option C) alters the antibody isotype but does not affect the variability of the variable region. VDJ recombination (option D) is the initial diversification event, which has already occurred before the B cells reach the Peyer's patches. Therefore, the correct process described in the question is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
