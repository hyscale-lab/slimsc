Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, so the question says that there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. Also, the radial velocity (RV) variations have different amplitudes for each system.

Let me think about what I know. Binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. When one star passes in front of the other, we get an eclipse. The period of the orbit is the same for both stars because they're orbiting each other. So the period given is the orbital period of the system.

The RV variations come from the Doppler effect. As each star moves towards us, their velocity is blueshifted, and when moving away, redshifted. The amplitude of these variations is related to the mass of the companion. Wait, but how exactly?

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the velocity amplitude is inversely related to the mass. The star with lower mass moves faster because it has to orbit the center of mass in a larger circle.

Oh, right! The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by a formula involving the mass of the companion. The formula is something like K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, P is the orbital period, and i is the inclination angle. But since both systems are eclipsing, their inclinations are close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1.

Wait, but in each system, each star's velocity is measured. So in system_1, the two RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. That must mean that the more massive star has the smaller velocity amplitude. Because the more massive one doesn't need to move as much—the less massive star moves more.

So in system_1, the two stars have velocities K1a=10 and K1b=5. Let me think, if the velocities are in a ratio of 2:1, then the masses should be in the inverse ratio, 1:2. Because mass is inversely proportional to velocity for the same orbital period. Because the center of mass requires M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. Let me denote the stars as Star A and Star B. For system_1, Star A has K_A=10, Star B has K_B=5. So M_A * K_A = M_B * K_B? Because the center of mass condition says M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B, where a is the orbital radius. But since a ∝ K * P/(2π), the velocities K are proportional to a. So K_A / K_B = (a_A)/(a_B) = (M_B)/(M_A). So K_A/K
