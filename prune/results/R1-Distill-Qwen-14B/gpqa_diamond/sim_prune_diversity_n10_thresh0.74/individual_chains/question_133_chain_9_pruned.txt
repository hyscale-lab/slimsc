Okay, I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three Ka values for H3PO4: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... H3PO4 is the acid, and it can donate three protons. But orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? Or wait, no, wait. The species in solution would depend on the pH. Hmm. Let me think: H3PO4 can lose H+ to form H2PO4^- (Ka1), then HPO4^2- (Ka2), and then PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-? Or is it H2PO4^-? I'm a bit confused. The term sometimes refers to the HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate ion. Or maybe the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, the question says 'orthophosphate ions'—I think HPO4^2- is the orthophosphate. So I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, so it gives
