Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are various propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I need to recall what the structures of these compounds look like. Acetates typically have an acetate group, which is OAc (O connected to two CH3 groups). So the structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3, wait no, wait. Wait, no—acetate is CH3COO- as the ester group. So the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait—no, the ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but in acetate esters, R' is usually methyl. So, like R-O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no—acetate is CH3COO-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3, but wait wait, no—maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. Acetate esters have the structure where the R group is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), and then another oxygen connected to a methyl group. So the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? Or maybe R-O-CO-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Acetate is the ester of acetic acid. So
