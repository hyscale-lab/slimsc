Okay, I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to think this through.

So the question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Let me restate the options to make sure I get them right.

Option a) Earth mass and Earth radius. So same as our planet. I know Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think that's the same as what we're considering for Earth.

Option b) 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so the density is given as 5.5, which is same as Earth, but mass is double. How does that relate to the radius? Because density is mass over volume. Volume depends on radius cubed. So if mass doubles but density stays the same, the volume must double. Since volume is (4/3)πr³, doubling volume would mean cube root of 2 in radius. So radius would be about 1.26 times Earth's radius. But I don't know if that's important yet.

Option c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density, right? Because it's made of the same stuff. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet would have the same. But wait, if you have same density and more mass, what about radius? Let me think. Mass is proportional to density times volume. Volume is r³. So if mass is 5 times, and density same, then volume is 5 times, so radius is cube root of 5. Cube root of 8 is 2, so cube root of 5 is about 1.7. So radius increases but density remains same as Earth, 5.5.

Option d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So density same as Earth, 5.5. Same line of reasoning as option c, but mass is halved. So radius would be (1/2)^(1/3) times Earth's radius. Which is about 0.793 times.

Wait, but the question is about the highest density. So let me see each option's density.

a) Earth's density is 5.5.

b) The planet has density 5.5, same as Earth.

c) Same composition
