Okay, so I've got this question about organic compounds and the light they emit or absorb. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others, right? Oh wait, but the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. So I need to figure out which color is absorbed based on the energy of the emitted light.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I think I should use the relationship between energy and wavelength here. Oh right, the formula is E = hc/位, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and 位 is the wavelength. But wait, I also remember that visible light has different colors corresponding to different wavelengths. So I need to find out the wavelength of the emitted light and then see which color that corresponds to. But wait, no, wait. The question is about the absorbed light, not what's emitted. Hmm, maybe I got that backwards.

Wait, wait. When a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits light. So the absorbed light's energy is higher than the emitted. So the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted would be the energy gap. But I'm not sure how that helps me directly here. Maybe I should focus on the energy of the emitted light to find out which color that is.

So let's think about the conversion from eV to wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/位. I can rearrange that to 位 = hc/E. I need the values for h and c. Planck's constant h
