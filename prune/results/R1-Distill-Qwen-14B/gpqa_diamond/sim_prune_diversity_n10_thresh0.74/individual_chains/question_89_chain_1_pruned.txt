Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that KOH can be a strong base, and when dealing with dibromides, especially vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides), elimination reactions can occur. Wait, but in this case, the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the structure, but maybe in a way that they are on bridgehead positions?

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Since adamantane is a polycyclic structure, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. But when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction. Oh, right, that's the E2 mechanism. So two bromide ions would leave, and the base would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So maybe the two bromines are on bridgehead positions. If so, elimination would form an allene (a conjugated diene?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, 1 and 3 are not adjacent; they are separated by a carbon. Oh, so maybe the molecule is 1,3-dibromo, meaning the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are two apart (like, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so 1 and 3 are separated by one carbon
