Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I remember that [Co(SCN)_2] is something about a blue color. Oh right, the different complexes have different colors. So, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (maybe?), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or wait, the number of SCN- ligands increases as the charge decreases, perhaps.

Stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, the complexes form in the order of increasing β, but wait, no. Wait, the stability constant is for each step. For Co^n+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_n^m+ (n steps). So the overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the previous beta and the current beta.

Wait, no, another way: The stability constant for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{m} is the product of the individual beta constants up to that n. So, β_total for [CoSCN]^+ would be β1=9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^{2-}, β2=40, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the stability constants are given for each successive complex. So, for the first complex, it's [Co(SCN)]^+ with β1=9. Then, each subsequent addition of SCN^- has its own beta. So β2 is for the second ligand binding, β3 for the third, etc.

So the overall formation constant (st
