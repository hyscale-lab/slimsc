Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation for a pretty complex organic molecule. Hmm, let's see. The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a big molecule with multiple double bonds and branches. 

The question gives me the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break all the bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. So for carbon, that's like breaking all the bonds in graphite or diamond to make single C atoms. 

Then there are bond energies given: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. So I guess I'll need to use these to calculate the molecule's enthalpy of formation.

Enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I need to figure out how to break down the molecule into its constituent elements and calculate the energy changes involved.

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is usually: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed)

Wait, no, wait a second. Actually, the standard way is to calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (atoms in elements) bond energies] - [Σ (bonds in molecule) bond energies]

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants (elements) and products (the molecule). The equation is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

Wait, no. When forming a molecule from elements, you're breaking the bonds in the elements (like C-C in graphite) and forming the bonds in the molecule. So the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed in the product (molecule). So:

ΔHf = (sum of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bonds formed in product)

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states. For carbon, it's graphite, which has C-C bonds. For hydrogen, it's H2 molecules with H-H bonds. So the process is: 

Elements (C and H2) → Molecule.

So the enthalpy change would be:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies in molecule)

Wait, no, because when forming the molecule, you break the bonds in the elements and form the bonds in the molecule. So the energy required to break the elements' bonds is subtracted from the energy released when the molecule's bonds form. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, I think the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (elements' bond energies) ] - [Σ (product's bond energies) ]

But wait, that would give the enthalpy change as positive if you're putting in energy, meaning the reaction is endothermic. Alternatively, the enthalpy of formation is the amount of energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed, minus the energy required to break the bonds in the elements.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated by subtracting the sum of bond energies of the product from the sum of bond energies of the reactants (elements). Because you're breaking the elements apart (so you have to put energy in) and then forming the molecule's bonds (which releases energy). So the formula would be:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of molecule)

Wait, no. Let's think of it as the energy required to decompose the molecule into elements. The enthalpy of formation is the reverse of that. So,
