Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, first, I should probably recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs is a transition metal carbene catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. It can lead to ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis, depending on the starting material.

The starting compound is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me draw the structure properly. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, pent means five carbons. So the structure must be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But to add a methyl on carbon 3, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and on C3, there's a methyl group attached. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. No, wait, that's
