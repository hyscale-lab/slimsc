Okay, I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. There are two parts, A and B, and I need to select the major products from the given options.

First, let's break down the problem. The first part involves a starting material reacting with BuLi and then H+. The second part is a Cope rearrangement upon heating.

Starting with the first reaction, part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. It looks like benzene with a substituent that's an oxygen attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down, the ene part is CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH(CH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2? No, but wait, but has four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me write it out. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at position 2. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the substituent is at position 1, so the group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2... Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of substituents.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- attached at the first carbon. Wait, no, that would make it 1-yl
