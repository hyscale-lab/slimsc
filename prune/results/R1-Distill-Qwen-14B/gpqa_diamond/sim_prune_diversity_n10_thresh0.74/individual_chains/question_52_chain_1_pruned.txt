Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about a star with certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That means the ratio is higher normally. So the factor is (ratio without spots)/(ratio with spots) = some number.

Hmm, okay. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I think the Boltzmann equation applies here. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula I remember is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy factor), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but how does this apply when the star's overall temperature changes? Because when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So each region of the photosphere (unspotted and spotted) has different temperatures?

Wait, no. The problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. But does that mean that the temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K? Or is the unspotted part still at 6000 K, and the spotted part at a lower temperature? Hmm, the way it's worded says the overall Teff is 5500, so maybe the entire photosphere's average temperature has dropped. But wait, that might not be accurate because spots are cooler regions. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere as a whole. Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the effective temperature is the same everywhere, which isn't physically accurate, but maybe the question is treating the average in a certain way.

Wait, but perhaps the effective temperature is the overall blackbody emission of the star, which is a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. But the question is about the photospheric conditions. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is at 5500 K. Or perhaps the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions at a lower temperature (but the problem doesn't give that temperature). Wait, but the problem doesn't provide the temperature of the spots themselves. So maybe the effective temperature is the average, but for the purpose of this problem, the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So I think that we can model the situation as: when the star has no spots, the photosphere is at 6000 K. When it has spots, the photosphere (as a whole, perhaps in terms of effective temperature) is at 5500 K.

Alternatively, maybe the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions are at a much lower temperature. But without knowing the temperature of the spots, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "when
