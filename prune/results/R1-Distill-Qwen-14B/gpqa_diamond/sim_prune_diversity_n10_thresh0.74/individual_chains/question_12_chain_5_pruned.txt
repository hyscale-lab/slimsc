Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The problem states: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, denoted as nu. The given masses are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. The options are choices for the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for this purpose, we can consider the neutrino to be massless. So the rest mass of the neutrino is approximately zero. That might simplify things.

Since the pion is initially at rest (Pi+ is stationary), the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the products must also be zero because momentum is conserved. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 

Let me recall the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion since it's at rest. So energy before = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino will have only kinetic energy (since its mass is negligible).

But wait, energy isn't the only thing conserved; momentum must also be conserved. So the vectors of their momenta must cancel each other out. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as p', then p + p' = 0. So p' = -p. But since they're opposite in direction, their magnitudes are the same, so |p| = |p'|. 

But how does this help me find the kinetic energies? Hmm, perhaps I can use the energy and momentum equations.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c^2. E_nu is the energy of the neutrino, which is |p| c, since it's massless (E = pc for massless particles).

So, the total energy is: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2.

Also, the momenta of muon and neutrino being equal in magnitude gives p_mu = p_nu. But p_mu is gamma m_mu v, and p_nu is E_nu / c since E = pc. Alternatively, since for the muon, p_mu = sqrt( (gamma m_mu c^2)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2. Hmm, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to set up equations using the fact that the momenta are equal in magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I can write the energies in terms of p. Let me denote the momentum as p.

For the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) 

For the neutrino: E_nu = p c (since m
