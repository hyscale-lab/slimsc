Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a particle in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that the mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it obeys Hooke's law F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, okay, so in a harmonic oscillator, the potential is like a spring. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formulas.

In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Then, the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C can't be the right answer. Because in relativity, velocities don't just keep increasing without bound; they approach the speed of light.

So I need to think about relativistic mechanics. The energy in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)k x², right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, so the potential is V(x) = ½ k x². But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (γ -1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but in relativistic oscillators, the system isn't just a simple harmonic oscillator. Maybe the equation of motion is different? Hmm, or perhaps we can think in terms of energy conservation.

At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, but wait, that's the maximum speed. Or wait, no: in SHM, the maximum velocity is when the potential is zero, right? So in the non-relativistic case, yes. But wait, in the relativistic case, does that hold?

Wait, no
