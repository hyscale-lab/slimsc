Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease in white lupine plants.

So, the setup is that there are three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The experiment tests the resistance to anthracnose. The results are given as percentages of the control (wild-type) resistance.

The data:

- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g2: 0% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0% resistance

And the question is about the interaction among these genes. The options suggest different possibilities involving transcription factors, pleiotropy, gene redundancy, and epistasis.

So, I need to figure out what's going on with the gene interactions based on these results. Let me think about what each result implies.

First, let's recall what knockouts mean. A knockout mutant (like g1) has the gene inactivated, so it can't produce its product. If the resistance is lower, that gene product might be contributing to resistance.

Looking at the single mutants:

- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big hit. So, without G2, the plant is completely susceptible. That suggests that G2 might be a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor because it's upstream. Because without it, the resistance is gone. So G2 is probably necessary for the resistance pathway.

When I look at the double mutants, especially those involving g2:

g1g2 has 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0. But g2 alone is already 0, so adding g1 doesn't change it. What does that mean? Well, if g2 already gives 0, adding another mutation doesn't make it worse. So perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. Or maybe G1's function is redundant when G2 is absent.

Wait, but what about the other double mutants. Let's see:

g1g3: 10% resistance. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out. g1 alone is 75%, g3 alone is 50%. So knocking out both gives 10%, which is much lower than either. So maybe they're acting in the same pathway, and their functions add up. Or perhaps G3 is downstream of G1. Or they might be in parallel pathways.

Another double mutant is g2g3: 0%. g2 is already 0, so even when you knock out g3, it's still 0. So perhaps G3's function is only active when G2 is present. Or maybe G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is missing.

Wait, let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks or modifies the effect of another. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation depends on the presence of gene A.

In this case, when considering the double mutants, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that could indicate epistasis. For example, if the double mutant g1g2 has the same resistance as g2, that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the phenotype of g2 is already 0, so adding g1 doesn't change it.

Similarly, in g2g3, the resistance is 0, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

So, putting that together, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That suggests that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is not functional, the downstream genes (G1, G3) can't help because the pathway is blocked at G2.

Now, looking at the single mutations. g2 has 0%, so G2 is necessary for any resistance. Therefore, G2 is likely a transcription factor that activates the expression of other genes, perhaps G1 and G3, which in turn contribute to resistance.

What about the other single knockouts:

g1: 75% resistance. So without G1, the resistance is reduced. That suggests G1 contributes to the resistance but isn't the only factor. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2 and works in the same pathway as G3.

g3: 50% resistance. So without G3, the resistance is halved. So G3 also contributes,
