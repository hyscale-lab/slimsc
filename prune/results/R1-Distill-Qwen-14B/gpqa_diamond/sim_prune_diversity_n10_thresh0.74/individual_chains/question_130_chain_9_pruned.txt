Okay, so I've got this question about the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detected using optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that Lyman alpha is one of the emission lines in hydrogen, specifically the transition from n=2 to n=1, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, if the cloud is neutral hydrogen, maybe it's absorbing instead of emitting? Oh right, the Lyman-alpha forest phenomenon involves absorption lines from neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium.

So the quasar emits light, and as the light travels through these clouds, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman-alpha wavelength. But since the quasar is at a higher redshift, the absorption feature would be shifted into longer wavelengths. Ground-based optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond a certain point because the atmosphere absorbs them, right? I think the atmosphere is opaque to a lot of UV, so ground-based telescopes can't see much below about 300 nm or so. Wait, no, I think it's that UV wavelengths are absorbed, so optical usually refers to longer wavelengths, like visible light and near-infrared.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm, way in the UV. So if these clouds are at a high redshift, the absorbed wavelength would be stretched. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emitted * (1 + z). So if the quasar's light is observed in optical wavelengths, which for ground-based telescopes would be perhaps around 400 nm to maybe 700 nm or so.

Wait, but the question is about when these clouds can be detected. So the absorption line must be in the optical range, which is the range that ground-based telescopes can observe. So the 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. The quasar's emission is at 1216, but due to the expansion of the universe, that gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength lambda = 1216 * (1 + z). We need this lambda to be in the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can detect it.

What's the optical range? Let's think. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So if the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms and higher, then it's in the optical range.

Wait, but wait, the Lyman-alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. So for the absorption to be seen in optical, the quasar's emission would have to be redshifted such that the absorption line is in the optical. So lambda_obs = 1216*(1 + z) needs to be >= 4000
