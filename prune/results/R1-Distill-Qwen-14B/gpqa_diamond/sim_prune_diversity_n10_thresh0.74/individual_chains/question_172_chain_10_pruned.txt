Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds. So, I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2.

I remember that in LTE, the excitation of atoms depends on the thermal energy of the gas. The Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula I think is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and g's are the statistical weights.

Wait, but in this case, the question says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the population in the specific energy level is twice that of star_2. Let's say n1 is the population in star_1 and n2 in star_2. So n1 = 2 n2. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of populations. If star_1's atoms are twice as excited, then the ratio n1/n2 would be 2? Or maybe the ratio of their excitation energies per atom? Not entirely sure, but let me proceed.

The energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars since it's the same specific energy level. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

Assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (since the same element and same energy levels), the ratio of populations would be (n1/n2) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Wait, let's write the Boltzmann factor for each star. For star 1, the ratio of excited to lower state is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2 it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2)
