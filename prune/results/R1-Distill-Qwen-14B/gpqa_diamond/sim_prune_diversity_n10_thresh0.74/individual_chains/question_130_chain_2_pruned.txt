Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let's read it again. The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space that absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. The goal is to find out the minimum redshift such that these objects can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Since it's being absorbed by the hydrogen clouds, these clouds must be between us (the observers) and the quasars (the background light sources). So, the quasars must be at higher redshifts than the clouds.

Wait, but the question is about detecting the absorption. So, if the cloud's redshift is z, then the Lyman alpha wavelength we observe would be longer, right? Because redshift stretches the wavelength. The observed wavelength would be lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z).

But optical telescopes can't detect ultraviolet light. So, for the absorption to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be within what optical telescopes can see. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red). So, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet. But if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the Lyman alpha line would be shifted into the optical range.

So, we need to find the minimum redshift z where 1216 Angstroms (rest frame) is redshifted into the optical range. Let's denote the observed wavelength as lambda_obs. So, lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). This lambda_obs has to be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength that ground-based telescopes can observe. What's the maximum optical wavelength they can see? I think it's about 700 nm, or 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, wait, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms? Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, right? So, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So, for the observed wavelength to be in the optical, lambda_obs should be <= 7000 Angstroms.

So, let's set up the equation:

1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000

Divide both sides by 1216:

1 + z <= 7000 / 1216

Let me calculate that. 7000 divided by 1216. Let's see:

1216 * 5 = 6080. 1216 * 5.75 = 1216 *5 + 1216*0.75. 1216*0.75 is 912. So 6080 + 912 = 6992. Close to 7000. So 5.75 gives 6992. The difference is 8. So 5.75 + (8/1216) ≈5.75 + 0.0066=5.7566.

So 7000 / 1216 ≈5.7566. So 1 + z <=5.7566. So z <=4.7566.

Wait, but wait. That's the maximum redshift where the Lyman alpha is just reaching 7000 Angstroms. But the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Hmm, no—the question is asking for the lower limit such that they can be detected. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the clouds must be
