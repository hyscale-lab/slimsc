Okay, so I've got this physics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined between 0 and L, and the potential is zero inside and infinite outside. The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D box are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem defines E as E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² * E. So for a single particle, the ground state is E_1 = E, first excited is E_2 = 4E, then E_3=9E, and so on.

But wait, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, right! Since they're fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers, but since they're spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up and down).

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each has a spin quantum number of ±1/2. But in the context of the infinite potential well, each particle's state is determined by its spatial wavefunction and spin. Since the particles are identical fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles. The total wavefunction is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. So the spatial part must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, and vice versa.

But for this problem, maybe I don't need to get into the spin part too much, especially since the question is about the energies, which are based on the spatial wavefunctions. So the key is to figure out how the particles fill up the energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion.

So the particles need to fill the lowest possible energy states, each with a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D box, the quantum number n is the only one for each particle, right? Because in 1D, the quantum state is determined solely by n. So each particle must have a unique n, or if possible, can have the same n but different spin, but wait, in a 1D box, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part. Or does it
