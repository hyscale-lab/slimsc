Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. Hmm, wait, but wait, the question is about energy, so maybe I don't need to calculate the exact value of e, but just use it symbolically for now.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. The options are given with various values in different exponents.

Wait, so point charges in an arrangement where 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, the charge at P is fixed, and the others are all at 2 meters away.

I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The formula is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r for each pair. Since all the charges are the same, it might simplify the calculation.

The system is isolated, so I guess we're considering the electric potential energy of the entire setup.

Wait, but how are the charges arranged? The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, I think it's like one charge at the center, and the other 12 arranged on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. But since they're identical and same charge, like, same sign, maybe they repel each other. Wait, but for potential energy, the arrangement affects the distances between the charges, which in turn affects the potential energy.

Wait, no, wait. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, which is where the 13th charge is. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. So the mutual distances between the 12 charges could vary, but I think the problem is simplifying by considering their arrangement as a fixed configuration, so perhaps they're placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters, but with each being 2 meters away from P. However, when
