Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So when the planet's mass causes the star to move, the spectral lines shift slightly.

The question says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV shifts are given: Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV shift is related to the velocity of the star. Because the star moves in response to the planet, the velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. The formula for K is from the radial velocity method. Let me recall.

I think the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3)) ) )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin(i)) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π * P) )^(1/3} )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i)/( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star (like Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So sin i is approx 1 for circular orbits and edge-on, which is usually the case for RV detection.

So simplifying, K ≈ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(2π P))^(1/3) ) * (1/(c)), where c is the speed of light, but perhaps that's more detailed than needed.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits) and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ (v) ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (
