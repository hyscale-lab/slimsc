Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. 

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know. Each electron is in a p orbital, which means their orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1. So each has l1=1 and l2=1. 

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, what's that mean? The state is |l1, l2, l, m>, right. So l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. Oh wait, but wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the total l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both are 1, the possible total l values are 0,1,2. But here the state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

Now, the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. So each Lzi is the z-component of the individual angular momenta. The measurement will give m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, respectively. Because Lz eigenstates are |l, m>, so eigenvalue is mħ. 

The problem asks for the probability that both measurements give -ħ. So, m1 and m2 must both be -1. Because if L1z is -ħ, then m1 is -1. Similarly
