Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky for me, but I'll walk through my thought process step by step. So the question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. I remember that the universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, which is like this background radiation leftover from the Big Bang.

The problem says that gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons, and this process affects the lifetime of these gamma-rays. I think the question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetime is limited by this annihilation process. The options are various GeV energies, so we're dealing with very high-energy gamma-rays.

First, I need to recall what this process entails. The reaction is γγ → e+ e-. So, two gamma-rays (or a gamma and a photon, but in this case, I think it's two gammas) annihilate to produce an electron-positron pair. But wait, in this case, one gamma is high-energy, and the other is from the CMB. Oh right, the problem states "with a photon from the CMB", so it's a γ (high-energy) and a CMB photon (low energy) annihilating.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. That's a really low energy, which makes sense because the CMB is microwave radiation, so photons are not very energetic.

Now, the concept here is that high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons. The idea is that the higher the energy of the gamma-ray, the more likely it is to undergo this annihilation process. At some critical energy, the rate of this interaction becomes so high that the gamma-rays can't travel far without annihilating, thus limiting their lifetime in the universe.

I remember that for such pair production processes, there's a condition based on the energy of the particles involved. The center-of-mass energy needs to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the produced particles. For electron-positron pairs, that's 2 times the rest mass energy of an electron, right? Because each electron is about 0.511 MeV, so two of them would be 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but in this case, the process is γ + CMB photon → e+ e-. So the energy in the center-of-mass frame needs to be at least 1.022 MeV. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the threshold energy in the lab frame. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation involves the product of the photon energies, as in the pair production condition.

I think the condition for pair production is that the product of the photon energies (in the center-of-mass frame) is at least 2*m_e^2 c^4, where m_e is the electron mass. But wait, photons don't have rest frames, so maybe it's about the invariant quantity, the square of the total four-momentum.

The invariant s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. For two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since photons are massless, E = pc for each. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E
