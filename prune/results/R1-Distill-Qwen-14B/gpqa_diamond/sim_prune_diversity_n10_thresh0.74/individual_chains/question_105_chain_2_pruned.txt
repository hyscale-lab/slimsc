Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. The scenario is that these spots cause brightness variations, which can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. 

First, let me make sure I understand what each part of the question is saying. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K, I think.

When a star with spots rotates, it causes changes in brightness as the spots come into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when it rotates, the spots will come into the line of sight, causing dips in brightness. Similarly, if a planet transits in front of the star, it would block some light, causing a dip too.

The problem states that the photometric variation from the spots can resemble an exoplanet. So, we need to find the radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) such that the planet's transit would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

Hmm. I remember that the change in brightness (the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

Î”F = (R_p / R_s)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. But wait, that's assuming the planet completely blocks the starlight from that area. But in the case of spots, it's a bit different because the spots are cooler regions. So the star's brightness isn't completely blocked but reduced because part of the star emits less light.

Wait, no. When the spots are facing us, that part of the star is emitting less flux. So the total brightness of the star as observed decreases by the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

So, the spot effect would cause a dip in brightness equal to the area of the spots multiplied by the fraction of flux they contribute. Since the spots are cooler, their flux is less than the surrounding areas.

Let me think. The star's total flux without spots is F0. The spots have an area A, and each part emits F_spot. The difference per unit area is (F0 - F_spot)/F0.

The filling factor is 20%, so the area of the spots is 0
