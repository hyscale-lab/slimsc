Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. That forms product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data are given. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's think about what happens when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH. I remember that adamantane derivatives, especially with two leaving groups like bromine, might undergo elimination reactions when treated with a strong base like KOH. Since it's heated, elimination is more likely than substitution. So probably, it would form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (maybe, depending on the structure). So when KOH is added, each Br could leave, but since it's a dihalide, perhaps both are eliminated to form a double bond. Let me recall: when you have vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens), treatment with a strong base like KOH typically leads to the formation of an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules to form an alkene.

Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Alkenes are usually colorless, but maybe the product is something else. Oh, wait, when you eliminate vicinal dihalides, you get alkenes. Alternatively, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diastereomer or has a specific structure that would form a specific alkene. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Looking at the NMR data of product 1:

1H NMR: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but product 1 comes from heating with KOH, which is a base. So maybe it's an elimination reaction, but wait, 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but if it's KOH and elimination, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation? Hmm, but KOH is more of a base. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: when two bromides are present, perhaps the reaction is more like a dehydrohalogenation but with a different mechanism. Alternatively,
