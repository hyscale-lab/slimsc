Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, the formula was something like S = (k * A) / (4 * L_p^2), where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area, and L_p is the Planck length. Right.

But wait, I need to find the area first. The question gives the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh, right, angular size is given by θ ≈ diameter / distance, but wait, actually, it's θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / (2d). Or wait, maybe θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size to the distance. Since θ is very small here (1e-17 degrees), maybe we can approximate it as θ ≈ size / distance.

Wait, let me think. The formula for angular size is θ = (diameter) / (2d), because the diameter would be the actual size, and the distance is from the observer. But when θ is very small, in radians, θ ≈ diameter / (2d). So, yeah, so the diameter would be approximately 2dθ, but I have to convert θ from degrees to radians first.

So, θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. Since 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_radians = 1e-17 * (π / 180). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17. Let's compute 3.1416 / 180 ≈ 0.01745. So θ ≈ 0.01745e-17 radians ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So the diameter D is approximately 2 * d * θ? Wait, because θ ≈ D/(2d), right? So D = 2 * d * θ.

Wait, no. Because θ in radians is equal to (opposite side)/(adjacent) in the small angle approximation. So if the event horizon's diameter is D, then θ ≈ D/(2d), because the opposite side would be D, and the adjacent is 2d (since it's the distance from the center to each side). Hmm wait, maybe I should think of it as the angular size being the diameter divided by the distance. So θ ≈ D / (d). Because, let's say, when you look at an object, the angle it subtends is roughly the size divided by the distance. Because for small angles, tan(theta) ≈ theta (in radians), and tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, which would be D/(2d). Wait, no, wait, because D is the diameter, so the opposite side is D, and the adjacent is the distance d. So tan(theta) = D / (d). But for very small theta, tan(theta) ≈ theta (in radians). So theta ≈ D / (d). Therefore, D ≈ theta * d.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure. If I have an object of diameter D at a distance d, then the angular size is about D/(d), but in radians. So yes, theta_rad ≈ D/(d). So D ≈ theta_rad * d.

So, the diameter is approximately theta_rad * d. Which is 1.745e-19 radians * 1e10 parsecs.

Wait, but wait, what's a parsec in meters? I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, 1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 m. So 1e10 parsecs is 3.0857e26 meters.

So D ≈ theta_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26) meters.

Let me compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7.

1.745 *3 is about 5.235, and 3.086 is a bit more than 3. So maybe 1.745 *3.086 ≈ let's compute it:

1.745 * 3 = 5.235, 1.745 * 0.086 ≈ 0.150. So total approx 5.385.

So D ≈ 5.385e7 meters. So about 5.385e7 meters. So the radius R is D/2 ≈ 2.69e7 meters.

But wait, I'm supposed to find the area of the event horizon, which is a sphere with radius R. So area A = 4π R².

Wait, but the event horizon is a sphere, so area is 4π R².

So R = D/2 = (theta_rad * d) / 2.

So A = 4π ( (theta_rad * d / 2) )^2 = 4 π ( (theta_rad^2 * d²) ) /4 ) = π theta_rad² d².

Wait, so A = π * theta_rad² * d^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So A is proportional to theta squared times distance squared.

So putting in the numbers:

theta_rad = 1.745e-19 radians.

d = 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e26 meters.

Compute theta_rad squared: (1.745e-19)^2 ≈ 3.046e-38.

d squared: (3.086e26)^2 ≈ (3.086)^2 *
