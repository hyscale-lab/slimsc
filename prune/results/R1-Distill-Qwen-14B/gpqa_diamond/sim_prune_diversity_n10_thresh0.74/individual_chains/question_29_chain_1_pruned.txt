Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about barley cultivars and mutations. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that there's a drought-resistant barley plant, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. So, the gene is split into exons (which are coding regions) and introns (non-coding, spliced out). They're using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking at the gene sequences in the mutants.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means disrupting the gene's function so it doesn't produce the compound. I remember that disrupting the gene can be done by causing a frameshift or a premature stop codon, which would make the protein nonfunctional.

Looking at the sequences, the intact gene is given, and each mutant has some changes in the first exon area. Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Change: The 5th and 6th nucleotides. Intact has TTT, Mutant 1 has TTC. So, that's a T to C change at position 5. Let's see the codon. The first few codons: ATG is methionine, then TTT (Phe) in intact. Mutant 1 has TTC (also Phe). So that's a synonymous mutation—doesn't change the amino acid. Then next codon: in intact it's CTC (Leu), but in mutant 1 it's CAC. Wait, wait. Let me see: the next part, the intact is TCGCTGG. So, the exact part where the change occurs is in the first few codons. Let me break it down.

Wait, maybe I should line them up. Let me write out the first few codons for each.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TTA TTG TCGC…TGA

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene's next part after ATG is TTT, then CTC, etc. Looking at Mutant 1: the change is in the first part. So, the first codon is ATG (same), next codon in intact is TTT (Phe), in Mutant 1, it's TTC (still Phe). So no change in amino acid. Then the next codon in intact is CTC (Leu). In Mutant 1, it's CAC. Oh wait, no: the next part for Mutant 1 is TAC. Let me recheck the sequences.

Wait, the problem gives the sequences as:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the first part is ATG T TCT ACG... Wait, no, the first few nucleotides are ATGTTCTA..., but that can't be right because the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the nucleotides and see where the changes are.

Intact gene (first part):
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G... etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G... etc.

Wait, no. Looking at their sequences:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCT
