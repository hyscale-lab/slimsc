Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energy and colliders. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking for the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So Li with 3 neutrons would be lithium-6, right? Because lithium typically has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons total—so Li-6.

So I'm thinking, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The options given are in GeV, so the units are in giga-electron volts. I remember that in particle physics, energies are often expressed this way.

First, I should probably figure out the rest mass of the nucleus. Since it's a Li-6 nucleus, I need the mass of a Li-6 atom. Wait, but in a collider, particles are accelerated, so do I consider the rest mass or the relativistic mass? Oh right, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is usually a significant fraction of the rest mass energy when speeds are high. But I'm not sure about the exact approach here.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. So I think that the energy per nucleon or per nucleus is what I'm looking for. But wait, the RHIC collides heavy ions, so each ion has a certain charge and mass. But the exact details might not matter for this calculation—maybe I just need to find the total energy of the nucleus when moving at 0.96c.

So, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me do that. v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then, 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of
