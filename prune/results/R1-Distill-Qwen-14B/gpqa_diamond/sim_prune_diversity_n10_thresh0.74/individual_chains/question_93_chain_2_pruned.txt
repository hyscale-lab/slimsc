Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in serial fashion and ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. That sounds perfect, right? Because a 100% efficiency means each cycle doubles the target. R2 of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, so the data should fit the curve really well.

Looking at the results, each concentration has three triplicates. Let's see the CT values:

- 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2.
- 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → average 31.0.
- 1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9 → average 27.6.
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6 → average 24.3.
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3 → average 21.0.

So each dilution step (10x) is a decrease in the copy number. Since qPCR efficiency is 100%, each 10-fold dilution should correspond to a decrease of about 3.3 CT cycles, right? Because the formula is CT = CT0 - (log2(n) * 1/slope). Wait, the slope is -3.3. Oh, wait, the slope in qPCR is usually negative because as the amount increases, the CT decreases.

Wait, the slope is -3.3, which is close to -3.3219, which is the expected value for 100% efficiency. Because 3.3219 is log2(10) times 1 (since 10 copies would be 10x less than 1000, so 3.32 cycles difference). So the slope being -3.3 is correct.

Now, for each ten-fold dilution, the CT should increase by approximately 3.3 cycles. Let's check the differences between the concentrations:

From 100,000 to 10,000 (10-fold dilution), the average CT goes from 34.2 to 31.0. The difference is about 3.2 cycles. That's pretty close, considering some variance. Next, from 10,000 to 1,000, it's 31.0 to 27.6. Difference is 3.4, which is about right. 1,000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3, difference of 3.3. 100 to 10: 24.3 to 21.0, difference of 3.3. So all the 10-fold dilutions are showing about a 3.3 cycle difference, which aligns with the expected 100% efficiency.

But the question is about discrepancies in the results. Wait, the options are about what explains the discrepancies. So looking at the data, each technical replicate is within about 0.3 cycles of each other. For example, the 100,000 sample has 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. So each is about 0.3 apart. That's pretty consistent. The same for the others.

So the question is, why are the results as they are? The options are about possible explanations for discrepancies. Let's look at the options.

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification
