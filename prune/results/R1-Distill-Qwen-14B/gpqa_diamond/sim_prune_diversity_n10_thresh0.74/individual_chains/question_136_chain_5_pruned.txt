Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I remember that this involves some concepts from the divergence theorem, maybe?

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. That probably means the vector field is F(r) = (something) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector in the radial direction. Wait, but since the magnitude is 1/r², maybe F(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So the field only has a radial component, and it's directed outward since the magnitude is positive.

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of F over the volume of a sphere. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. Oh right, the divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇·F) dV = ∫∫ F · dA over the surface.

So, maybe I can compute this in two ways. Either compute the divergence in the volume and then integrate, or compute the surface integral at radius R.

Let me think about computing the divergence first. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r), right? Since there are no θ or φ components, the other terms vanish.

So F_r is 1/r². Plugging into the divergence formula: ∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Simplifying that inside term: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So d/dr of 1 is 0. Therefore, ∇·F = 0 everywhere except possibly the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. The divergence at r=0 would be a problem because our function F(r) is 1/r², which goes to infinity as r approaches zero. So maybe the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's undefined or has a delta function.

Ah, right! Because the divergence is zero except at r=0, the volume integral over any region that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the region includes the origin, like our sphere of radius R, then the divergence is a delta function there. So maybe the integral is not zero in that case.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The divergence in the volume (r > 0) is
