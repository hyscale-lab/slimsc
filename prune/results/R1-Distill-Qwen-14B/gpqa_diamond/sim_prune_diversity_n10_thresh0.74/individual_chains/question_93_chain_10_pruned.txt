Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's think through it. 

The question says that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and serially diluted it. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which is a perfect correlation, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, I think the slope in the calibration curve (like the standard curve) is related to the efficiency. 

In a standard qPCR curve, the formula is usually something like Ct = a - (b * log(concentration)). The slope (b) is used to calculate the efficiency. Oh right, the formula is Efficiency = 10^(-1/slope). So if the slope is -3.3, then 1/slope is about -0.303. So 10^0.303 is approximately 2. So the efficiency is around 90% or 10^(-1/3.3) = about 2, so 2-fold per cycle. Wait, wait, no, that would mean 100% efficiency because the efficiency is (10^(-1/slope)) - 1. So wait, 10^(-1/(3.3)) is about 10^-0.303 which is about 0.5. So 0.5, then subtract 1? Wait, no, perhaps I have that formula wrong. Oh wait, no, the efficiency is calculated as E = 1 - 10^(-slope). Because the slope should be negative. So slope is -3.3, so 10^3.3 is about 2000. So 1 - (1/2000) is 0.9995, which is almost 100% efficiency. Oh, that makes sense. So the efficiency is very close to 100%, so the data should be very consistent.

The results he got are the Ct values for each concentration. Let me look at the data:
