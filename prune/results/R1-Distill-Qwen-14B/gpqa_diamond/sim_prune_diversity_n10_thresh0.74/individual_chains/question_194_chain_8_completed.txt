Okay, so I've got this problem here about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm a bit new to statistical mechanics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states of the three spins and calculate the energy for each, then sum exp(-βE) for each state.

Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states. Let me list them all. Maybe writing them out as tuples (S1, S2, S3):

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these states, I need to compute E and then compute exp(-βE), then sum all those.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than going through all 8. Perhaps grouping them by the number of +1s and -1s or something related to their interactions.

But let's proceed step by step. Let's compute E for each state.

The energy formula is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Since each S is ±1, each product S_i S_j will be +1 if the two spins are the same and -1 otherwise.

So S_i S_j is 1 when S_i = S_j, else -1.

So for each state, I need to compute the sum: S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me compute this for each state.

1. (+1, +1, +1): 

S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3 = 1*1=1
S2S3 =1*1=1
Sum =1+1+1=3
E = -J * 3 → E = -3J

2. (+1, +1, -1):

S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum=1-1-1= -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

3. (+1, -1, +1):

S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J

4. (+1, -1, -1):

S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= J

5. (-1, +1, +1):

S1S2=(-1)(1)=-1
S1S3=(-1)(1)=-1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum= -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= J

6. (-1, +1, -1):

S1S2=(-1)(1)=-1
S1S3=(-1)(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum= -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= J

7. (-1, -1, +1):

S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1
S2S3= (-1)(1)=-1
Sum= 1 -1 -1 = -1 → E= J

8. (-1, -1, -1):

S1S2=1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
Sum=3 → E= -3J

Wait, so let me summarize the energies:

States 1 and 8: E = -3J
States 2,3,4,5,6,7: E= J

So in the partition function, each state contributes exp(-β E) multiplied by 1 (since each state is equally probable in this model, right? Because all microstates are distinct and we're considering each once).

So for state 1 and 8: E = -3J → exp(-β (-3J)) = exp(3Jβ)

Each of these will contribute exp(3Jβ) each. So two states contributing that.

For the other 6 states, each has E= J → exp(-β J * 1) → exp(-J β )

So each of the 6 states contributes exp(-J β )

So the partition function Z is [2 * exp(3J β)] + [6 * exp(-J β ) ]

Looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ) → That's 2 e^(-3Jβ), which would be if the first term was E=+3J, but in our case, the first term is 2 e^(3Jβ), so A is not correct.

Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ). That's exactly what I have. So Z=2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Options:

A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)
B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)
C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)
D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

So option B matches what I calculated.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the energies. Did I compute them correctly?

In state 1, all spins up: all products are 1, sum 3 → E=-3J. So exp(3Jβ) for each.

In states 2-7, each has E= J. So each contributes exp(-Jβ).

Wait, but wait: for state 2, (+1, +1, -1), S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum 1-1-1=-1 → E= J. So yes, correct.

Another way: perhaps, the number of +1 and -1 terms? Maybe for the energies, but I think the calculation was correct.

So the partition function Z is 2 exp(3Jβ) +6 exp(-J β ), which matches option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we use the energy formula \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is given by summing the Boltzmann factors \( e^{-\beta E} \) over all possible spin states, where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible spin states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin states, listed as tuples \( (S_1, S_2, S_3) \):
1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Compute the energy for each state
The energy is calculated using \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). Each product \( S_iS_j \) is \( +1 \) if \( S_i = S_j \) and \( -1 \) otherwise. The results are:
1. \( (+1, +1, +1): S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1): S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1): S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1): S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1): S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1): S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1): S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), sum = \( -1 \), \( E = J \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1): S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), sum = \( 3 \), \( E = -3J \)

### Step 3: Group states by energy
- States 1 and 8 have \( E = -3J \), contributing \( 2e^{3J\beta} \) (since \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3J\beta} \)).
- States 2–7 have \( E = J \), contributing \( 6e^{-J\beta} \) (since \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-J\beta} \)).

### Step 4: Write the partition function
The partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:
\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A:** \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are reversed).
- **Option B:** \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C:** \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents).
- **Option D:** \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, wrong exponents and coefficients).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
