Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that radioactive decay follows something called the exponential decay law. Oh right, the formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number of undecayed atoms at time t, N0 is the initial number, and λ is the decay constant.

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. I think that means the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%, right? So the probability P(t) of decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). So for t=100, P(100) = 0.32.

Let me write that down: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is about... let me think. ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, so 0.68 is a little less, maybe around -0.4005. So λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 = 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the question says 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 +150 is 200 minutes. So we need to find P(200) minus P(50), because P(200) is the probability of decaying by 200 minutes, and P(50) is before that. The difference would be the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.

Alternatively, another way: since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability that it
