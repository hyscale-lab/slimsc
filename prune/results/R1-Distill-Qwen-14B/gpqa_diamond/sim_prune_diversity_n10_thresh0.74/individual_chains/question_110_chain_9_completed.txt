Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like measuring the radial velocity of stars, right?

The question gives me some details about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distance, and extinction in some cases. The key is to figure out which stars are bright enough to be observed by both instruments.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17, but not fainter than that. HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So HIRES can go a bit fainter than ESPRESSO, up to V=16.

So the first step is to find the apparent V magnitude (m_v) of each star. Because the ability to detect a star depends on its apparent brightness, not the absolute magnitude. Oh right, because apparent magnitude is how bright it appears from Earth, which is what the telescopes see.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. Using the distance modulus formula, m_v = Mv +5 +5 log10(d) where d is distance in parsecs.

So, 5 log10(10) is 5*1=5. So m_v = 15.5 +5 = 20.5. Oh, wait, that's way too bright, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait: the formula is m - M = 5 log10(d/10), so m = M +5 log10(d) -5. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5, where d is in parsecs.

So for Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. m =15.5 +5*(1) -5 =15.5. So m_v is 15.5. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if d=10, then the term 5 log10(10) is 5, so m = Mv +5 -5 → Mv is m? Hmm, so Star1's apparent magnitude is 15.5. But wait, that's the same as its absolute magnitude. That makes sense because it's at 10 pc, so the apparent magnitude equals the absolute magnitude.

But wait, Star1's distance is 10 pc, so yeah, m = Mv. So m=15.5.

Now, can both telescopes detect it? ESPRESSO can go up to 17 mag. So 15.5 is brighter than that, so it can be detected by ESPRESSO. HIRES can detect up to 16 mag. 15.5 is brighter than 16? No, wait, 15.5 is less than 16? Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So 15.5 is brighter than 16. So m=15.5 is brighter than 16, so HIRES can detect it. So yes, both can detect Star1.

Wait, but wait the options don't have Star1 and Star4 as correct. Wait, let me look at the options. The options are A) Star4 and Star5, B) 3 and5, etc. Hmm.

Star2: m_v is given as 16.5 mag. So for HIRES, which can go up to 16, 16.5 is fainter than that. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so it can't either. So Star2 is too faint for both.

Star3: It's given m_v=15.5 mag. Wait, but wait, no: Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6. So there's extinction (interstellar dust) affecting its apparent magnitude. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, and the total absorption in V band is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed m_v is the intrinsic (or absolute) m plus the extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for extinction is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but Star3's given apparent magnitude is 15.5. So that's before extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude? Hmm, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption...". So I think the given 15.5 is the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude. So the observed m would be 15.5 + Av. Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86.

So m_observed =15.5 +1.86=17.36. So that's the apparent magnitude we'd observe. So for ESPRESSO, which can go up to 17, 17.36 is barely above, so it wouldn't be detected. HIRES can go up to 16. 17.36 is way above, so can't detect. So Star3 is too faint for both.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. If the star's intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is 15.5, but because of extinction, it's dimmer. So the observed magnitude is higher (since higher magnitudes are fainter). So yes, 15.5 +1.86=17.36. So for both telescopes, this star is too faint. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Star4: Absolute Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc. So same as Star1, m_v =15.5. But wait, Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4. So Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed m_v would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed magnitude is 16.74.

For ESPRESSO, which can observe up to 17, 16.74 is acceptable. So ESPRESSO can detect it. For HIRES, which can go up to 16, 16.74 is above 16, so no. So Star4 is too faint for HIRES, but can be seen by ESPRESSO. So both can't detect it.

Wait, so Star4's observed magnitude is 16.74, which is above 16. So only ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: Absolute Mv=16.5, distance 5 pc. Let's compute m_v. Using the formula m = Mv +5 log10(d) -5. d=5. log10(5)=0.69897.

So m =16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5. Let me calculate 5*0.69897 is about 3.4949. So 16.5 +3.4949=19.9949, minus5 is 14.9949. So m_v is approximately 15.0.

But wait, that's without extinction. Star5 doesn't have any extinction given, so m_v is 15.0.

Now, can both telescopes detect it? HIRES can go up to 16, so 15 is bright enough. ESPRESSO can go to 17, so yes. So both can detect Star5. So Star5 is a candidate.

Wait, but let me recount Star5's m_v:

Mv=16.5, d=5. So m =16.5 +5*(log10(5)) -5. Log10(5) is ~0.69897.

So 5*0.69897=3.4949. So 16.5 +3.4949=19.9949. Minus 5 → 14.9949, which is ~15.0.

So m=15.0, which is well within both ESPRESSO (up to 17) and HIRES (up to 16). So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but what about Star4? Earlier I thought Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5?

Wait, Star1: m=15.5. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so yes. HIRES can see up to 16, so 15.5 is brighter than 16, so yes. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait: Wait, m=15.5 is less than 16, so it's brighter than 16. So for HIRES, yes, it can detect Star1. So Star1 can be observed by both.

So the question is which stars can be detected by both. So let's see:

Star1: detected by both.

Star5: detected by both.

So the options are:

Looking at the options, option A is Star4 and Star5. But Star4 can't be detected by both. Option B is Star3 and Star5. Star3 is 17.36, which is too faint for both, so no. Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star4 isn't detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake with Star4?

Star4: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m_v=15.5. Then E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24. So observed m_v=16.74.

So for ESPRESSO, m=16.74 is fainter than 17? 16.74 is less than 17, so it's within the limit. So ESPRESSO can detect it. But HIRES can only go up to 16. So 16.74 is above 16, so HIRES can't. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

So which stars can both detect? Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Star3 can't be detected by both.

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Only Star5 fits.

Wait, no. Wait, Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. Are they in any option?

Looking at options:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 not detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 not detected by both.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Both too faint.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 not detected by both.

Wait, so none of the options have Star1 and Star5. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, let's recheck.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m=15.5. No extinction mentioned, so m=15.5.

For ESPRESSO: m <17 → yes.

For HIRES: m <16 → m=15.5 is <16? Wait, no. Wait, the question says HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, wait, "brighter than". So for a star with m_v=15.5, it's brighter than both 16 and 17. So yes, both telescopes can see it.

Star5: m=15.0, which is also brighter than 16 and 17. So both can detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, none of the options have both. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Star1's m_v.

Wait, Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

Distance modulus is m-M =5 log10(d) -5.

So for d=10, 5 log10(10)=5*1=5. So m-M =5-5=0. So m =15.5. Correct.

So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star5: m=15.0, so both can see.

So the correct pair is Star1 and Star5, but that's not one of the options. So am I missing something?

Wait, the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in considering Star4 or another star.

Wait, perhaps Star5's distance is 5 pc, so m=15.0. Correct.

Wait, maybe Star4's m after extinction is 16.74→ which is below 17 for ESPRESSO, but above 16 for HIRES. So can't be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, maybe Star5's m is 15.0, so both can detect. So the possible candidates are Star1 and Star5. But none of the options have that.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Star5's m_v.

Wait, Star5's Mv is 16.5, d=5 pc.

m = Mv + 5 log10 (d) -5.

So d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897 ≈3.4949.

So m=16.5 +3.4949 -5 =16.5 + (-1.5051)=15.0 (approx).

Wait, correct.

So which options have Star1 and Star5? None. So perhaps I made a mistake in another star.

Wait, looking at Star4 again: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m_v=15.5. But with E(B-V)=0.4→ Av=1.24. So m_observed=15.5+1.24=16.74.

So for ESPRESSO, 16.74 is okay (only up to 17). For HIRES, max is 16. So cannot detect. So Star4 is not detected by both.

Wait, what about Star3?

Star3's given m_v=15.5 mag (apparent), but with E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=3.1*0.6=1.86. So observed m=15.5+1.86=17.36.

So for ESPRESSO (17 mag limit), 17.36 is too faint. HIRES can't even go that far. So Star3 can't be detected by either.

Hmm, so if the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5, but the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me re-read.

The question says: Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs?

So, the stars need to be observable by both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's calculation. Let's see.

Star5: Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(d) -5.

d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5 * 0.69897=3.4949.

m =16.5 +3.4949 -5 = 16.5 + (-1.5051)=15.0. Correct.

So Star5 is m=15.0, so both can see it.

Star1: m=15.5, both can see.

So the answer would be Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options:

Options given:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by both

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't be seen by both

C) Star2 and Star3 → both too faint.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't.

Wait, perhaps I missed that Star5's m_v is 15.0, which is fainter than Star1's 15.5. Wait, no, 15.0 is brighter than 15.5.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But no, because Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the extinction for Star4.

Wait, Star4 has E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the star is within the observable range of both, regardless of their absolute magnitudes. Maybe I should check if the stars are within the declination ranges of the telescopes, but the question says to disregard pointing limits.

So, without considering pointing, the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1's m_v. Let me check again.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(10) -5 → 15.5 +5 -5 =15.5. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is that none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating Star5's m_v.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the distance modulus. Let me double-check the formula.

The formula is m - M = 5 log10 (d /10 ), where d is in parsecs.

So m = M +5 log10 (d/10)

Which is the same as m = M +5 (log10(d) -1) → M +5 log10(d) -5.

Yes, correct.

So for Star5, d=5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

So m =16.5 +5*(0.69897) -5 =16.5 +3.49485 -5 =16.5 + (-1.50515)=15.0.

Yes, correct.

So maybe the answer is that Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct option is A) Star4 and Star5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star4's extinction. Wait, Star4's absolute magnitude is 15.5, d=10 pc, so m=15.5. But with extinction, m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So for HIRES: can't detect. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the star is detectable by each telescope, regardless of the other. But the question says which can be detected by both.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's m_v. Perhaps I forgot to consider the absolute magnitude correctly. Wait, Star5's Mv is 16.5, d=5 pc.

So, m =16.5 +5*(log10(5)) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

So 5 *0.69897=3.49485.

m =16.5 +3.49485 -5 =16.5 + (-1.50515)=15.0.

Correct.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both, but looking at the options, option A includes Star5 and Star4, but Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star4's distance. Oh wait, Star4 is at 10 pc. So m=15.5 before extinction.

But wait, if the star's Mv is 15.5 and it's at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude is 15.5. But with extinction, it's 16.74. So for HIRES, 16.74 is above their 16 limit, so can't detect. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's list each star's m_observed and see.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction → 15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. No extinction. So ESPRESSO can detect (17 limit), HIRES can't (16 limit). So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 +1.86=17.36. Both can't detect.

Star4: m=15.5 +1.24=16.74. ESPRESSO can (17 limit), HIRES can't.

Star5: m=15.0. Both can detect.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back: the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D) Star1 and Star4, but that can’t be because Star4's m is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star4's m after extinction. Let me check.

Star4's absolute Mv=15.5, d=10 pc. So m=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=3.1*0.4=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

HIRES can only go up to 16. So 16.74 is too faint. So Star4 is not detectable by both.

Wait, perhaps only Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both, but they're not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in Star5's calculation.

Wait, perhaps Star5's Mv is 16.5, d=5 pc. So m =16.5 +5*log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.699.

So 5 *0.699=3.495.

16.5 +3.495=19.995. Minus 5 is 14.995, so m=15.0.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps Star5's m is 15.0, which is detectable by both. Star4's m is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES, but perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus for Star1.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for m is M +5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, for d=10, 5 log10(10)=5*1=5. So m= M +5 -5= M. So m=15.5 for Star1. Correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but that can't be right because Star4's m is 16.74, which is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which stars can be observed by both. Star5 can be observed by both, but Star1 can as well. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering Star5's Mv. Wait, Star5's Mv is 16.5, which is fainter than Star1's 15.5. But the apparent magnitude is what matters.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the given options. Let me look again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider that Star5's distance is 5 pc, so its apparent magnitude is brighter than Star1's. Hmm, but that doesn't affect the detection.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Star5's Mv is 16.5, which is fainter than Star1's 15.5. But the calculation for m_v is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But I can't see how that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star5. Let me recalculate Star5's m_v.

Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log10(5) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 * 0.69897=3.4949.

So m=16.5 +3.4949=19.9949. Minus 5=14.9949, so m=15.0.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about "brighter than 17" and "brighter than 16". So a star with m=15.5 is brighter than both, so both can detect.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5, but they're not in the options. So perhaps the intended correct answer is D) Star1 and Star4, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the extinction.

Wait, perhaps the extinction is subtracted, not added. No, extinction makes stars appear fainter, so m increases.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about Star4. If Star4's observed m is 16.74, which is within ESPRESSO's limit (17), but above HIRES's limit (16), so only ESPRESSO can detect it.

So the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A) Star4 and Star5, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but again, Star4 can't be detected by both.

Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should list each star's m_observed and see which are detectable by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=17.36 → neither.

Star4: m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15 → both detect.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about absolute magnitudes, but no, it's about apparent magnitudes.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" → so m <17.

HIRES: m <16.

So, Star1: m=15.5 → both detect.

Star5: m=15 → both detect.

So, the correct answer should be both Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But no, Star4's m is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star4's m calculation. Let me check again.

Star4: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m =15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=1.24.

m_observed=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck here. Maybe the intended answer is option A) Star4 and Star5. But I can't see why.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about which stars can be observed by both spectrographs regardless of their magnitudes, but considering other factors, like maybe some stars are not observable from certain locations. But the question says to disregard the pointing limits.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that only Star5 can be detected by both. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps Star4 can be detected by both. But Star4's m=16.74 is too faint for HIRES.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the extinction is in the V band, but maybe I should compute the extinction differently. Wait, the question says that the total absorption in V is related to E(B-V) with a coefficient of 3.1. So Av=3.1 * E(B-V). So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus for Star5.

Wait, Mv=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(d) -5.

log10(5)=0.69897.

5 *0.69897=3.4949.

So m =16.5 +3.4949 =19.9949 → minus5 →14.9949. So m=15.0.

Yes, correct.

So, the only stars that can be detected by both are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me see:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But as I said, Star4 can't be detected by both.

So, the correct answer isn't among the options. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be detected by either instrument. But the question says 'both'.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the HIRES limit. The question says HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So m <16, because lower magnitude is brighter. So m=15.5 is brighter than 16, so yes.

So Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is D) Star1 and Star4, but that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) Star4 and Star5, but that's incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but I have to choose that, but I know it's wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the star's declination affects visibility, but the question says to disregard pointing limits.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the stars are observable from both observatories. Paranal is in Chile, Keck in Hawaii. So declination matters for visibility.

But the question says to disregard pointing limits, so I should ignore that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but I can't find a way for that to be correct. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star4's calculation. Let me think again.

Star4: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc → m=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=1.24. So m_observed=16.74.

HIRES can go up to 16. So 16.74 is above, so can't detect.

So, no, Star4 can't be detected by both.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about whether the stars are brighter than the magnitude limit, so for ESPRESSO, m <17. So Star4's m=16.74 <17 → detectable by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, m must be <16. So 16.74>16 → can't detect. So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

Wait, Star5's m=15.0. So both can detect.

Star4's m=16.74. ESPRESSO can detect, HIRES can't.

So, Star5 can be detected by both. But which other star can be detected by both? Star1.

So, the answer should be Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Star1's m calculation.

Star1: Mv=15.5, d=10 pc.

m = Mv +5 log10(10) -5 →15.5+5-5=15.5.

Correct.

So, in conclusion, the correct answer is that Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both, but they're not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option D) Star1 and Star4, but I can't see how that's correct.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes ($m_v$) of the stars, considering both their intrinsic brightness and extinction (interstellar dust). The detection limits are as follows:

- **ESPRESSO**: Stars with $m_v < 17$ can be detected.
- **HIRES**: Stars with $m_v < 16$ can be detected.

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**  
- **Given**: $M_v = 15.5$, $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.  
- **Calculation**:  
  Using the distance modulus formula,  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
  \]  
  Substituting $d = 10$,  
  \[
  m_v = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.5$ is brighter than both 16 and 17, so **both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect Star1**.

#### **Star2**  
- **Given**: $m_v = 16.5$, $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.  
- **Calculation**:  
  Since $m_v$ is given, no further calculation is needed.  
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.5$ is fainter than HIRES's limit ($m_v < 16$) but within ESPRESSO's limit ($m_v < 17$). Thus, **only ESPRESSO can detect Star2**.

#### **Star3**  
- **Given**: $m_v = 15.5$, $d = 15 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
- **Calculation**:  
  Extinction in the V band is given by  
  \[
  A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]  
  Observed $m_v$ is  
  \[
  m_v = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 17.36$ is fainter than both ESPRESSO's and HIRES's limits. Thus, **neither telescope can detect Star3**.

#### **Star4**  
- **Given**: $M_v = 15.5$, $d = 10 \, \text{pc}$, $E(B-V) = 0.4$.  
- **Calculation**:  
  Using the distance modulus,  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 = 15.5
  \]  
  Extinction in the V band is  
  \[
  A_v = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]  
  Observed $m_v$ is  
  \[
  m_v = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 16.74$ is fainter than HIRES's limit ($m_v < 16$) but within ESPRESSO's limit ($m_v < 17$). Thus, **only ESPRESSO can detect Star4**.

#### **Star5**  
- **Given**: $M_v = 16.5$, $d = 5 \, \text{pc}$, no extinction.  
- **Calculation**:  
  Using the distance modulus,  
  \[
  m_v = M_v + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
  \]  
  With $\log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897$,  
  \[
  m_v = 16.5 + 5 \cdot 0.69897 - 5 = 16.5 + 3.49485 - 5 = 15.0
  \]  
- **Conclusion**: $m_v = 15.0$ is brighter than both 16 and 17, so **both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect Star5**.

### Final Answer:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star2, Star3, Star4**: Not detectable by both telescopes.  

The correct pair of stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES is **Star1 and Star5**. However, this pair is not listed in the provided options. Based on the given options, **none are correct**. If forced to choose, **option A (Star4 and Star5)** is the closest, but it is not entirely accurate since Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES.
