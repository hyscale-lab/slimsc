Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The setup is that they're doing an experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

The experiment's results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild type (which is 100%). The data is:

- g1: 75% (so lower than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

They're asking which conclusion about the interactions between these genes can be drawn from these results. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what each of these results might mean.

First, when you knock out a gene and see a decrease in resistance, that suggests the gene product is contributing to the resistance. So g2 knockout is completely susceptible. That's a big effect. G2 might be a key gene here. The fact that g2 is 0% suggests that without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So maybe G2 is essential for resistance, or it's a critical component.

G1 knockout has 75% resistance. So the plant is less resistant, but still has some. So G1 contributes, but isn't the only one.

G3 knockout has 50% resistance. So it's even less than G1. But wait, when you look at double mutants, the g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. That's interesting. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That might suggest that G3's function is downstream of G2 or that G2 is masking the effect of G3 when it's present.

Wait, but when you have the double mutant g1g2, it's 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is gone. But without G2 alone, it's also gone. So maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Because if G2 is upstream, without it, G1 can't function either. Or perhaps G1 and G2 are in the same pathway.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So combining g1 and g3 makes the resistance even worse. That suggests that the effects of G1 and G3 are additive or synergistic. So each gene contributes to the same pathway, and losing both makes the situation much worse.

Now, looking at g2g3: 0% resistance. But g2 alone is 0% already. So adding g3 doesn't make it any worse. That suggests that G3 is either redundant with G2 or that G3's function is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is already knocked out, then G3's contribution isn't adding anythingâ€”so when you knock out both, it's the same as knocking out G2 alone.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would prevent the expression of downstream genes, including maybe G1 and G3. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then in the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 aren't expressed because they're downstream targets. But wait
