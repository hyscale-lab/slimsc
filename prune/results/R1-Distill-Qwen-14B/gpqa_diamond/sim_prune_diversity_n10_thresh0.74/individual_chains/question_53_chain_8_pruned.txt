Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. Alright, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

The IR shows an ester group, so that tells me the compound has an ester functional group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So that's a clue.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two signals correspond to aromatic protons. So the ring has two different types of aromatic protons, which suggests that the substituents are in certain positions. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be para, meta, or ortho. Wait, but if it's para, I would expect only two types of aromatic protons—each pair in symmetrical positions. So that's a possibility. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that lead to two distinct sets, like two substituents that are not symmetrical, like for example, one substituent is an ester and another is something else, but arranged in a way that each has different neighboring groups. Hmm.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Wait, vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. The NMR says one is a doublet and another is a doublet of quartets. So, maybe there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached, like an acyl group with a double bond. Oh, wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. Wait, perhaps the structure includes an ester and an alkene group elsewhere.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the di-substituted ring has an ester group as one substituent and another group that has vinyl protons. So maybe one substituent is an ester (like an OCOOR group) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH-). But wait, that might cause some splitting in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of another group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps there are two sets of vinyl protons. For example, if there's an ester group attached to a benzene ring, and perhaps another substituent is a double bond, maybe part of a substituent like -CH₂CH₂COO something? Hmm, not sure yet.

The NMR also shows two signals for -CH3 groups. Wait, methyl groups. So two distinct methyl groups. Maybe one from the ester (like the R in OCOOR) and another from another part of the molecule. Also, there are no signals for -CH₂ groups, which suggests that perhaps there are no methylene groups in the structure. So any CH₂ groups would have to be attached in a way that their protons don't show up, which is unlikely unless they're part of a more complex structure.

Let me think about the possible structure. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, and there's an ester group, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR
