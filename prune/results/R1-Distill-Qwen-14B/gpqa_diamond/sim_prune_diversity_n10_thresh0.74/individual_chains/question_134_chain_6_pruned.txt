Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's start by understanding what's being asked.

The problem says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, typically per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved.

Wait, but wait, this is a bit more complicated because there are three solutions here. I need to find out the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution and see what the net reaction is.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, find the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. The molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. That gives 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL which is 0.3 L, and molarity 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

The volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

So now, total H+ is 0.28 moles, total OH- is 0.2 moles.

When H+ and OH- react, they form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The heat of neutralization for this is usually around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), but wait, I should check standard values. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases because it's an exothermic reaction.

But wait, in this case, I have more H+ than OH-. Because 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So all the OH- will react, and there will be some H+ left over.

So the neutralization will proceed until the OH- is consumed. The limiting reagent here is OH-.

So the moles of H+ that react are 0.2 moles, and the moles of OH- that react are 0.2 moles. The remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

So the total enthalpy change is the amount of heat released from the reaction. Since each mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting releases about 57 kJ, but wait, I think the standard value is 57 kJ per mole of H+ reacting, but wait, the problem might use different units or a different standard value.

Wait, another point: I remember that sometimes the enthalpy is given per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-. So in this case, 0.2 moles of OH- reacting would give 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ of heat released. But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is usually the heat per mole of reaction as written. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether it's per mole of H+ or per mole of H2O.

Wait, let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of water is formed from the reaction of an acid and base. So for the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ per mole of H2O.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H2O are formed. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Option B is -11.42 kcal, and D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the units. Oh, because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So if I calculate in kJ, then convert to kcal if needed.

Wait, no, because the given options have both kcal and kJ. Let me see: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol of H2O, which is approximately -13.66 kcal/mol because 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.6. So for 0.2 moles, that would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ or approximately -2.73 kcal.

Wait, so -11.4 kJ is about -2.73 kcal. Let me compute it accurately.

57 kJ = 13.61 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ). So 57 /4.184 = approximately 13.61.

So 0.2 moles × -57 kJ/mol = -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, 0.2 moles × (-57) kJ → -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.
