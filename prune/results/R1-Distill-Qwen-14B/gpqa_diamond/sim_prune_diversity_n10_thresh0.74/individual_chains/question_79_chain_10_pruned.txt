Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on some NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, let's start by understanding the given information.

The compound X is C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is commonly known as DBU. Oh right, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms, because it can abstract protons and help form double bonds by removing leaving groups. So maybe the reaction here is an elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond or some ring structure.

The product's NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows several signals: two singlets around Î´ 2.28 and 2.31, each integrating to 3H. Then there are some doublets in the aromatic region. The 13C NMR has signals as well, including some around 130, 140 ppm, and a carbonyl-like peak at 197.7 ppm. Wait, that 197 ppm is probably a carbonyl, maybe a ketone, but DBU is more about elimination, so maybe an epoxide? Or perhaps a carbonyl group formed.

Wait, but the product's molecular formula... Let me think. The starting material is C11H12O. After reaction, what would change? If DBU is causing an elimination, maybe it's removing a molecule, like water, which would make the product C10H10O, or maybe the formula changes based on other factors.

Let me look at the NMR data again. The 1H NMR has two singlets around 2.3 ppm. Each has 3H, so probably two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom or a ring, like in an epoxide. But wait, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm, so maybe those are not the epoxide protons. Alternatively, perhaps they're attached to carbonyl groups or something else.

Looking at the aromatic region: signals at 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). This seems like a substituted styrene or something similar. The doublets suggest coupling with adjacent protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents on adjacent carbons, you can get such patterns. Wait, maybe it's a trans or cis coupling in a double bond.

The 13C NMR tells us about the carbons. The peak at 197.7 is a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or an ester. But wait, in an epoxide, the
