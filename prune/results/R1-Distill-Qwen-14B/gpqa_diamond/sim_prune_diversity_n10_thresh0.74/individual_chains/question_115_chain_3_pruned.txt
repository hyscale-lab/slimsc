Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and think through step by step.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, like an electron and positron, they produce photons. Since they're moving in opposite directions along the same axis, their collision is head-on. So the system's total momentum and energy must be conserved.

Wait, Lorentz factors are given. Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2.

First, since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta will be opposite. But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so maybe its momentum is in the opposite direction to the electron's.

Let me think about their momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, for an electron and a positron, they have the same mass, right? So m_e = m_p = m.

Electron's velocity v_e: since gamma_e =4. So gamma_e = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_e^2/c^2)) =4. Let's solve for v_e in terms of c maybe? But perhaps it's easier to compute their beta (β = v/c) first. So for the electron, gamma_e=4.

Gamma squared is 16, so 1/(1 - beta_e^2) =16 → 1 - beta_e^2 =1/16 → beta_e^2=15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682c. Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, divided by 4 is 0.968. So v_e ≈0.968c to the right.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p=2. So gamma_p=1/sqrt(1 - beta_p^2)=2. Squaring:
