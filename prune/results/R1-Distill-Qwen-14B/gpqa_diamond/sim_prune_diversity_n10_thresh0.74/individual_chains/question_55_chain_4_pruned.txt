Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me see what I can do. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between cis and trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm.

Alright, let me start by recalling what these structures look like. Acetate esters typically have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So, propenyl and butenyl groups would be attached to the oxygen.

For the NMR data provided: 

- 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a pretty high coupling constant. I remember that in alkenes, the coupling between vinyl protons can be around 10-18 Hz. Wait, J=16 suggests it's a trans coupling because cis would be lower, like around 10-12 Hz. Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Or maybe it's about the diastereotopicity in some other structure. Hmm, I'll need to think more.

- 5.5 ppm, 1H, dq. A doublet of quartets? Or maybe a doublet with some splitting. So this proton is probably next to an electronegative group or a branching point. Like maybe a vinyl proton adjacent to an oxygen, or perhaps part of a double bond with more complex splitting.

- 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet. That's typically the acetyl group in an ester. The OAc group has a methyl that's deshielded but usually appears around 2.1 as a singlet because it's not split by any neighboring protons.

- 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet. So a methyl group attached to something that's split into a doublet. Maybe an isopropyl group or a CH2 that's next to something else.

Wait, but propenyl and butenyl groups are the main substituents here. Let me think about the structures.

Cis and trans in propenyl acetate would refer to the configuration around the double bond. Propenyl is CH2CHCH2-OAc, but that's not quite right. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but as a substituent attached to the acetate.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of propenyl acetate
