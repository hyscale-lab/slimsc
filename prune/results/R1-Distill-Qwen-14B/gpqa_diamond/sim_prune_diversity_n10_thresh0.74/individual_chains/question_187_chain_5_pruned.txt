Okay, so I have this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-precision spectrograph, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks how many of the listed stars would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, each star's detectability depends on whether it meets this S/N condition.

First, I need to figure out what factors influence the S/N ratio for a star when observed with ESPRESSO. I remember that S/N is influenced by factors like the star's brightness (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the instrument's efficiency, and the noise sources like background or thermal emission.

ESPRESSO is mounted on the VLT, which has 8m telescopes. The VLT's light-gathering area is quite large, which should help in getting a good S/N. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of ESPRESSO's performance. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed for high-resolution spectroscopy and has a high efficiency, especially in the visible range. But handling the exact numbers is tricky.

Wait, the S/N per binned pixel after an hour. So the key here is to calculate the expected S/N for each star and see if it's >=10.

The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / (noise), but I think another approach is to use the formula based on magnitudes. I recall that the S/N depends on the star's apparent magnitude. The fainter the star (higher magnitude), the lower the S/N.

I think the formula for S/N can be approximated as S/N â‰ˆ 5.02 * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m is the apparent magnitude, m0 is some reference magnitude (like the magnitude where S/N is 1 per second), and t is the exposure time in seconds.

Wait, but I'm not sure about m0. Alternatively, I think that for a star of a certain apparent magnitude, the S/N per pixel can be calculated based on the instrument's characteristics. Maybe the ESPRESSO has a certain S/N per hour for a star of a certain magnitude.

Alternatively, I might need to think about how the apparent magnitude relates to the number of photons. The apparent magnitude affects how much light we receive. The farther a star is, the fainter it appears, and the lower the S/N.

So, each star in the options has an absolute V magnitude (Mv) of 15, but their distances vary. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs. So, for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude (m) using the distance modulus formula: m = Mv + 5 log10(d / 10 pc), where d is the distance in parsecs.

Let me calculate the apparent magnitude for each option.

Option a) Canopus. I remember Canopus is a bright star. Let me check its apparent magnitude. I think it's around -0.
