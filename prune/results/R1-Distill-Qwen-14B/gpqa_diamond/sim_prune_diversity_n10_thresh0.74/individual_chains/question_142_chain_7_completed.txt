Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where the density matrix ρ given is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because each of the basis states |0> and |1> has equal probability, and there's no coherence between them.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how the density matrix maps to the geometric representation. I think the Bloch sphere comes into play here. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state, it's a point on the surface of the sphere, but for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written as:
ρ = [ [ (1 + a_z)/2 , (a_x - i a_y)/2 ],
       [ (a_x + i a_y)/2 , (1 - a_z)/2 ] ]
where a = (a_x, a_a_y, a_z) is a vector with magnitude ≤ 1. The point a defines the position on the Bloch sphere. For a maximally mixed state, I think all the coherences (the off-diagonal terms) are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal.

Looking at the given ρ, the off-diagonal terms are zero. Because |0><0| has 1 in the (1,1) position, and |1><1| has 1 in (2,2) position, so when you add them and multiply by 1/2, each diagonal term becomes 1/2. So the density matrix becomes:
[ [1/2, 0], 
  [0, 1/2] ]

Comparing this to the general form, the a_x, a_y terms are zero. So a_x = 0, a_y = 0. What about a_z? The diagonal elements are (1 + a_z)/2 and (1 - a_z)/2. For both to be 1/2, I set (1 + a_z)/2 = 1/2. Solving that gives 1 + a_z =1 → a_z=0. So the vector a is (0,0,0). 

So the point in the Bloch sphere is at the origin. But wait, the Bloch sphere has radius 1, and the origin is the completely mixed state. Oh right, because when a is zero, the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state. That makes sense.

Now, looking at the options. Option C is r=(0,0,0), which would correspond to the origin. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, which would be |0> state. But in this case, since it's a mixed state, it's not a pure state, so it's not on the surface. The origin is the point for the maximally mixed state, so that's correct. 

Wait, but what's the coordinate system here? In the Bloch sphere, usually, the z-axis is the population difference, and x and y are the coherences. So the vector (a_x, a_y, a_z) would correspond to the point in the 3D space. So when a is (0,0,0), the point is at the origin. 

So the correct answer should be option C, which is r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state corresponds to equal probabilities for both the \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) states, with no coherence (off-diagonal terms) between them. Writing the density matrix explicitly:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of a vector \(\mathbf{a} = (a_x, a_y, a_z)\), where the components of \(\mathbf{a}\) determine the position of the state in the qubit space. For the given density matrix, the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are equal, implying \(a_x = 0\), \(a_y = 0\), and \(a_z = 0\). This places the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\(r = (1,1,0)\)) and **Option D** (\(r = (1,1,1)\)) are incorrect because they describe points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, which correspond to pure states, not mixed states.
- **Option B** (\(r = (0,0,1)\)) is incorrect because it corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **Option C** (\(r = (0,0,0)\)) is correct, as it represents the origin of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin.

Answer: C
