Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. So, the question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are of length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We're to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can use the tan theta ≈ theta approximation because the angles are small.

Wait, wait. I remember that when you have a circular aperture, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by the formula sinθ = λ/(π a), which comes from the single-slit diffraction. But this is a polygon with many sides, and if N is very large, the aperture would approximate a circle, but perhaps the diffraction pattern might be similar to a circular aperture? Or maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says it's a polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. So, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length and the number of sides. But as N becomes very large, the polygon tends towards a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a' because the apothem in a polygon with a very large number of sides is almost the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, wait, maybe the radius R of the polygon is a?

Wait, no. For a regular polygon, the apothem 'a_p' is given by R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a_p ≈ R. So in this problem, the apothem is given as 'a', so R would be approximately 'a' when N is very large. So the polygon would approach a circle of radius 'a'.

But wait, wait. The question is about the far field diffraction. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has its first minimum at θ where sinθ = λ/(π a). But in this problem, the polygon's apothem
