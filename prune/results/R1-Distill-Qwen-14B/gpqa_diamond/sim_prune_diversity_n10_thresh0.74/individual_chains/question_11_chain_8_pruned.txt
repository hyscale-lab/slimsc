Okay, so I've got this question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I need to find the incorrect statement. Hmm, tricky. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect, so all but one are correct, and I need to find the exception.

Option A: SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.

Wait, I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 form a heterodimer. The ExoN domain in nsp14, when bound to nsp10, makes an exonuclease. But what does this do? I think this exonuclease is involved in removing RNA bases during replication, maybe proofreading. But the statement says it prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. Hmm, or does it cause it? Wait, exonucleases usually break down nucleic acids. Oh, wait, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps it's involved in removing mismatches. Oh, right, in the replication process, the RNA is being synthesized, and if there's a mismatch, the exonuclease would remove the incorrect part. So nsp14-ExoN is an exonuclease that does this. So the statement says it prevents the breakdown, but maybe it actually causes the breakdown? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps in the host cell, preventing dsRNA breakdown would mean the host's enzymes aren't breaking it down, which could help the virus. I'm a bit confused on this point. Let me think again. Host cells have enzymes that degrade dsRNA, like RIG-I which triggers antiviral responses. So if the viral enzyme prevents that breakdown, maybe that's a way to hide the dsRNA from the host's sensors. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the viral ExoN is involved in degrading host RNA or viral RNA for replication. I'm not entirely sure about this one. I'll come back to it.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic pathway. So the statement says that ORF3
