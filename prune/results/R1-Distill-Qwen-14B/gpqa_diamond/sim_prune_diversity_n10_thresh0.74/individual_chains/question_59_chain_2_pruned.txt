Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations, which I remember can get a bit tricky. But let's break it down step by step.

The problem says: I have three solutions mixed together. The first is 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), the second is 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and the third is 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the total amount of each acid and base in moles because the solution is a mixture, and they'll react with each other. Oh right, because mixing an acid and a base will lead to neutralization reactions. So the first step is to calculate the moles of each.

Let me start by recalling that moles = concentration (M) * volume (L). So I'll convert the volumes from mL to liters.

For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Its volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is strong, all these moles will produce H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 â†’ Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So first, the moles of Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So the moles of OH- will be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when we mix these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait. The acetic acid is a weak acid, so I'm not sure if it should be treated differently. For neutralization reactions, all the strong acid (HCl) will react first, I think. Because strong acids dissociate completely, so their H+ is readily available.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate total H+ and OH-.
2. Subtract the moles to see if excess H+ or OH- remains.
3. Then, determine the pH based on the excess.

But wait, the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will provide a lot of OH- ions. Let's think: how much H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH?

Wait, the HCl will contribute 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3CO
