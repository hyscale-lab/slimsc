Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron, and I need to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about synchrocyclotrons.

From what I remember, cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field to bend charged particles in a circular path, while an electric field accelerates them. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but they can handle particles with higher energies. They have a varying magnetic field, which allows them to accommodate particles as their speed increases.

The question says that a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0 at t=0. It undergoes two accelerations and reaches a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, I think the frequency ν in such accelerators is related to the revolution frequency of the particles. In a cyclotron, the frequency is determined by the magnetic field and the mass of the particle. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes over time, so the frequency might vary too. However, maybe in this problem, the frequency is constant because the voltage is given with a fixed ν.

I'm trying to remember how the kinetic energy relates to the voltage. Oh right, each time the proton passes through the gap between the D-shaped electrodes, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied. But wait, the voltage is alternating, so each half-cycle (each time the voltage peaks) would give the particle a kick. So maybe each time the voltage is at maximum, the proton gains energy.

Wait, but since the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(θ), where θ = 2πν t + Φ0. The maximum voltage is U0, and it alternates. So the particle would gain energy each time the voltage is at a peak, but I'm not sure if that's how it's applied. Alternatively, perhaps each full cycle (period) of the voltage corresponds to a certain energy gain.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In a cyclotron, the particles go around in a circle, and each time they cross the gap between the dees, they get an energy boost. The frequency of the electric field must match the revolution frequency of the particles for maximum efficiency. But synchrocyclotrons have a varying magnetic field, so the revolution frequency changes as the particle's speed increases.

But in this problem, the voltage is given as an alternating voltage with a fixed frequency. Oh, but wait, maybe the frequency here is actually the same as the revolution frequency of the proton as it's accelerated.

Wait, let me think about the energy gain. The kinetic energy gained by the proton should be related to the number of times it's accelerated. Since each time it goes around, it gets a little more energy. Or maybe each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton gains a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but the voltage is sinusoidal. So the energy transfer per revolution depends on how much time it spends in the accelerating region. Hmm, perhaps the energy gained per revolution is approximately equal to the voltage amplitude U0. But
