Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. Right, so in a vacuum, gas molecules don't collide much, so the mean free path is longer.

So Mike designed this high-res transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, so I guess the number of gas molecules is super low. But some gas particles are still there, and the mass spec detected them.

He determined the mean free path as λ1 based on things like the compartment volume, pressure, and temp. Wait, so under normal conditions (without the electron beam), the mean free path is λ1.

But when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature stayed the same. So why would that happen?

I think the electron beam must be interacting with the gas molecules somehow. Maybe the beam is causing the gas particles to ionize or something. Oh wait, when electrons hit gas molecules, they can cause them to become charged—like ionization. So the gas molecules might become ions.

Now, if the gas particles are ions, how does that affect their collisions? Well, charged particles would interact more strongly with the walls of the vacuum chamber or with each other. Wait, no. Wait, the mean free path is about how often they collide with each other or with other surfaces. If the gas is neutral, they don't interact much. But if they become ionized, they might get attracted to the walls of the chamber, which are probably charged or can hold charges. Or maybe other ions could cause more frequent collisions.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. If the gas was neutral, then the mean free path is determined by the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. But if the gas molecules are ionized, perhaps their behavior changes. Do ions have a shorter mean free path because they interact differently?

Alternatively, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, it could be that the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which might cause them to move more, or perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other or the walls.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, perhaps the cross-section changes. Or perhaps the ionized molecules have a higher cross-section because of their charge, leading to more frequent collisions. Alternatively, maybe the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, which would increase the probability of collisions with the walls.

Wait, but why would that affect the mean free path? If the ions are sticking to the walls more, their mean free path would be shorter because they're hitting the walls more often. So the mean free path would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1. Because before, the gas was neutral, so their collisions were infrequent, leading to a longer mean free path. But when ionized, they might collide more, so λ2 < λ1.

So looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → longer, which doesn't fit.
B) λ2 = λ1 → that would mean no change, but the question says it's different.
C) λ2 < λ1 → this fits with our reasoning.
D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 → No, because λ2 is smaller.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1. So the correct answer should be C.


The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In an ultra-high vacuum, the number of gas molecules is extremely low, and the mean free path is determined by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Mike observed that in the sample compartment, the mean free path was initially λ1 under vacuum conditions. However, when the electron beam was activated, the mean free path changed to λ2, even though the temperature remained constant.

The electron beam likely caused ionization of the gas molecules, introducing charged particles (ions) into the system. Charged particles interact more strongly with the vacuum chamber walls or with each other compared to neutral particles. This increased interaction leads to more frequent collisions, effectively reducing the mean free path. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision frequency, so the ionization of gas molecules would result in a shorter mean free path (λ2 < λ1).

Analyzing the options:
- **A)** λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1: This implies a longer mean free path, which contradicts the scenario.
- **B)** λ2 = λ1: This suggests no change in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with Mike's observation.
- **C)** λ2 < λ1: This aligns with the reasoning that ionization reduces the mean free path due to increased collisions.
- **D)** λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1: This implies an intermediate mean free path, which does not fit the scenario.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1.

Answer: C
