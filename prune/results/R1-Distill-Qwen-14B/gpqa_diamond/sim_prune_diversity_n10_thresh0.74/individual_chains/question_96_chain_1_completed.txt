Okay, so I have this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which relates to their area. Oh right, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula! The entropy S is proportional to the area of the event horizon. The formula is S = (A * k) / (4 * ħ c), where A is the area, k is Boltzmann's constant, and ħ and c are the reduced Planck constant and speed of light, respectively.

The question says the angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees. Wait, the event horizon's angular size is given, and the distance is 10^10 parsecs. I think I can use that to find the actual size of the event horizon. Oh, right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (diameter of the object) / (distance), but in radians. Oh wait, let me think again. I should probably convert the angle from degrees to radians first because the formula θ ≈ (size)/(distance) works in radians.

So θ in radians is approximately (π/180) * θ_degrees. Let me compute that. θ is 1e-17 degrees, so in radians, that's (pi/180) * 1e-17 ≈ (3.1416/180) *1e-17. Let me calculate that: 3.1416/180 is about 0.01745. So 0.01745e-17 radians, which is 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, no, wait: 0.01745 * 1e-17 is 1.745e-19? Wait, 0.01745 is 1.745e-2, so 1.745e-2 * 1e-17 is 1.745e-19. Yeah.

Wait, but the formula for the angular diameter is θ = 2R/d, where R is the radius of the object and d is the distance. Because the diameter is 2R, so angular diameter = (2R)/d. Oh wait, so the actual diameter of the event horizon is θ * d. But wait, that's in radians. So diameter D is approximately θ_rad * d? So radius R would be (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, let me get that right. The formula for the angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ (diameter) / (distance). So diameter D = θ_rad * d. So yes, D = θ_rad * d. Since the radius R is D/2, R = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

So first, I need to compute the radius R of the event horizon. Once I have R, I can compute the area A of the event horizon, which is 4π R². Then, using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, I can find the entropy S.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Compute the diameter D = θ_rad * d.
3. Compute R = D / 2.
4. Compute A = 4π R².
5. Compute entropy S = (A * k) / (4 ħ c).

Wait, but what are the values of the constants? Let me note them down:

k = Boltzmann's constant ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.
ħ = reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.
c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s.
π ≈ 3.1416.

But wait, the distance d is given in parsecs. I need to convert that to meters. How many meters are in a parsec? I remember one parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs would be 3.086e16 * 1e10 = 3.086e26 meters.

So, let's compute each step.

First, θ_degrees = 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians:

θ_rad = (pi / 180) * θ_deg = (3.1416 / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, more accurately: 3.14159265 / 180 ≈ 0.0174532925. So θ_rad = 0.0174532925 * 1e-17 = 1.74532925e-19 radians.

Then D = θ_rad * d. d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 3.086e26 m. So D = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = Let's compute that.

Multiply 1.745e-19 by 3.086e26: 1.745 * 3.086 is approximately 5.38, but let me compute more accurately.

1.745 * 3.086 = 1.745 * 3 =5.235, 1.745 * 0.086= approx 0.150. So total around 5.385.

Then exponents: 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So D ≈ 5.385e7 meters.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26:

1.745 * 3.086 = let's compute this.

1.745 * 3 = 5.235.

1.745 * 0.086 = 0.150 (approx 0.150).

Total is about 5.385.

But more accurately:

3.086 * 1.745 = ?

Let me compute 3 * 1.745 = 5.235.

0.086 * 1.745: 0.08 * 1.745 = 0.1396, 0.006 * 1.745 = 0.01047. So total 0.14907.

So 5.235 + 0.14907 = 5.38407.

So D = 5.38407e7 meters.

So R = D/2 = 2.692035e7 meters.

Now, compute the area A = 4 * π * R².

Compute R squared: (2.692e7)^2.

2.692e7 squared: (2.692)^2 = ~7.24, and 1e7 squared is 1e14. So 7.24e14 m².

Multiply by 4 * π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566.

So A ≈ 12.566 * 7.24e14 = Let me compute 12.566 *7.24.

12 *7.24= 86.88, 0.566 *7.24≈4.104. So total approximately 90.984.

So A≈90.984e14 m² = 9.0984e15 m².

Now, compute S = (A * k) / (4 ħ c).

Wait, the formula is S = (A * k) / (4 ħ c), right? Let me confirm: yes, S = (A k)/(4 ħ c).

So plugging in the numbers:

A is 9.0984e15 m².

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So compute numerator: A *k = 9.0984e15 * 1.38e-23 = Let's compute this.

9.0984 *1.38 ≈ 12.55 (since 9 *1.38=12.42, and 0.0984 *1.38 is about 0.135, so total 12.555).

Exponents: 1e15 *1e-23 =1e-8.

So numerator is approximately 12.555e-8 J m²/(s).

Wait, wait, no: Units are okay because when you multiply A (m²) by k (J/K), you get J m²/(s) ??? Wait, no, k is J/K, A is m². So A *k is (m²) * (J/K) = J m²/(something? Wait, not sure about units, but let's proceed numerically.

Denominator:4 * ħ *c =4 * 1.0545718e-34 *3e8.

Compute 4 *1.0545718e-34 = 4.218287e-34.

Multiply by 3e8: 4.218287e-34 *3e8 = 1.265486e-25.

So denominator is ~1.265e-25.

So S = (12.555e-8) / (1.265e-25) = (12.555 /1.265) * 1e17.

Wait, 12.555 /1.265 is approximately 10, because 1.265 *10=12.65, which is close to 12.555. So roughly 9.922.

Wait, let me compute 12.555 ÷ 1.265:

1.265 *9 =11.385. 1.265*9.9=12.5235. So 9.9 times.

Because 9.9 *1.265 = (9 *1.265) + (0.9 *1.265) )= 11.385 +1.1385=12.5235.

Which is just below 12.555. So 9.92 or so.

So approximately 9.92e17 J/K.

Wait, that's 1e17 times 9.92, which is ~1e18 J/K? Wait no, wait: 12.555e-8 /1.265e-25 = (12.555 /1.265) *1e17.

Wait, because 1e-8 / 1e-25 is 1e17. So yes.

So 12.555 / 1.265 ≈9.92, so 9.92e17 J/K.

Wait, 9.92e17 is approximately 1e18, but looking at the options, the choices are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. Hmm, that's way lower than the options. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. No, I think I messed up exponents somewhere. Let me go back through the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I confused the diameter and radius. Let me recheck.

Wait, the formula is that the angular diameter θ ≈ D/d, where D is the actual diameter. So D = θ * d (in radians). So yes, I did that correctly.

Wait, but when I calculated D as 5.38e7 meters, that's the diameter. So radius R is half that: ~2.69e7 meters.

Then area A is 4 pi R squared.

R squared is (2.69e7)^2 = 7.24e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 * 3.1416 *7.24e14 = approx 90.98e14 m² = 9.098e15 m².

Then S = (A *k)/(4 ħ c).

Wait, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So A*k = 9.098e15 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute 9e15 *1.38e-23 = (9 *1.38) *1e(15-23) )= 12.42 *1e-8 = 1.242e-7 J m²/(something?), but units aside, the number is 1.242e-7.

Wait wait, I think I made a mistake in exponents. 9.098e15 *1.38e-23 = (9.098 *1.38) *1e(15-23) )= 12.45 * 1e-8= 1.245e-7.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * c =4 * 1.0545718e-34 *3e8.

Compute 1.05457e-34 *3e8= 3.1637e-26.

Multiply by 4: 4 *3.1637e-26=1.2655e-25.

So S = (1.245e-7) / (1.2655e-25) ) = (1.245 /1.2655) * 1e18.

Wait, 1.245 /1.2655 is approx 0.983.

So S ≈0.983e18 J/K =9.83e17 J/K ~1e18 J/K.

But the options are 1e59, 1e62, etc. So that's way off. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the distance. Because 1 parsec is about 3.08567758e16 meters. So for d=1e10 parsecs, it's 3.08567758e16 *1e10 =3.08567758e26 meters.

Wait, yes, I used that earlier. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the diameter D again.

Wait, let me recalculate D.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees = (pi/180)*1e-17 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

d =1e10 parsec =3.08567758e26 meters.

So D =θ_rad * d =1.74533e-19 *3.08567758e26.

Multiply 1.74533e-19 *3.08567758e26.

1.74533 *3.08567758 = let me compute that.

1.74533 *3 =5.23599.

1.74533 *0.08567758 ≈ approx 0.150 (since 0.085 is about 8.5%, 1.745 *0.085≈0.148). So total approx 5.384.

So D=5.384e7 meters.

Wait, 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7. So D is 5.384e7 meters. So that's correct.

So R= D/2=2.692e7 meters.

Then area A=4 pi R².

R²= (2.692e7)^2=7.245e14 m².

A=4 *3.1416 *7.245e14= approx 4*3.1416=12.566; 12.566*7.245e14=9.095e15 m².

Now, S=(A*k)/(4 ħ c).

A=9.095e15 m².

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So numerator A*k=9.095e15 *1.38e-23 = (9.095*1.38) * 1e(15-23) = 12.45 *1e-8 = 1.245e-7 J m²/(something). Wait, no, units are J·m²/(s·something?), but I think I'm getting confused. Let's just compute the numbers.

Denominator:4 * ħ * c=4 *1.0545718e-34 *3e8.

1.0545718e-34 *3e8 =3.1637e-26.

Multiply by 4: 1.2655e-25.

So S= (1.245e-7) / (1.2655e-25) )= 1.245 /1.2655 *1e18.

1.245/1.2655 ≈0.984.

So S≈0.984e18 J/K= 9.84e17 J/K ≈1e18 J/K.

But the options are way bigger. The given options are 1e59, 1e62, 1e65, 1e66. So I'm way off. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) * (k/(c)). Wait, sometimes I see the formula written as S = (A k c^3)/(4 ħ G ħ c) )? Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think. The formula is S = (A k )/(4 ħ c). Wait, no, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G) multiplied by a constant.

Wait, I think I need to get the formula right. Let me recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: S = (A k c^3) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon. Wait, that makes sense because the units would work out.

Wait, so perhaps I forgot the c^3 and G in the formula.

Oh no, that's a big mistake! I used S = (A k)/(4 ħ c), but the correct formula is S = (A k c^3) / (4 ħ G).

Ah, that's probably where I messed up. So I need to include the constants correctly.

So the correct formula is S = (A k c^3) / (4 ħ G), where:

A is in m²,

k is Boltzmann's constant,

c is speed of light,

ħ is reduced Planck constant,

G is gravitational constant.

So I think I forgot to include c^3 and G in the formula. So let me recompute using the correct formula.

So let's compute S = (A * k * c^3) / (4 * ħ * G).

Now, let me note down the values:

k =1.38e-23 J/K.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

So let's compute each part.

A is 9.095e15 m².

So numerator: A *k *c^3 =9.095e15 * 1.38e-23 * (3e8)^3.

Compute (3e8)^3: 27e24 =2.7e25.

So,

Numerator:9.095e15 *1.38e-23 *2.7e25.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 9.095e15 *1.38e-23 = (9.095 *1.38) *1e(15-23) )= 12.45 * 1e-8 =1.245e-7.

Then multiply by 2.7e25: 1.245e-7 *2.7e25 = (1.245 *2.7) *1e( -7 +25 )= 3.3615 *1e18 =3.3615e18.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G =4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11.

Compute 1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (1.05457 *6.6743) *1e-45.

1.05457 *6.6743 ≈7.024.

So denominator=4 *7.024e-45 =28.096e-45 =2.8096e-44.

So S = numerator / denominator =3.3615e18 / 2.8096e-44 = (3.3615 /2.8096 ) *1e(18 +44) )= approx 1.196 *1e62.

So about 1.196e62 J/K.

Which is approximately 1e62 J/K. Looking back at the options, option A is 1e62 J/K.

But wait, the options are A)1e62, B)1e59, etc.

So the correct answer should be approximately 1e62, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Compute numerator: 9.095e15 *1.38e-23 = (9.095 *1.38) = approx 12.45. So 12.45e-8.

Multiply by 2.7e25: 12.45e-8 *2.7e25 = (12.45 *2.7) =33.615e17 =3.3615e18.

Denominator: 4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11.

1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 = 7.024e-45.

4*7.024e-45=2.8096e-44.

So S=3.3615e18 /2.8096e-44 = (3.3615 / 2.8096 ) *1e62.

3.3615 /2.8096≈1.196. So 1.196e62 J/K, which is about 1e62.

So the entropy is approximately 1e62 J/K. So the correct option is A) 1e62 J/K.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A k c^3}{4 \hbar G}
\]

where:
- \(A\) is the area of the event horizon,
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) is Boltzmann's constant,
- \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light,
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\) is the gravitational constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the radius of the event horizon
The angular size of the event horizon is given as \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\), and the distance to the black hole is \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs}\). First, convert \(\theta\) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{\pi}{180} \cdot \theta_{\text{deg}} = \frac{\pi}{180} \cdot 10^{-17} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The diameter of the event horizon can be calculated using the relation \(\theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{D}{d}\), where \(D\) is the diameter:

\[
D = \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d = (1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.086 \times 10^{26}) \approx 5.384 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The radius is half the diameter:

\[
R = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{5.384 \times 10^7}{2} \approx 2.692 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the event horizon
The area of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R^2.
\]

Substitute \(R = 2.692 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}\):

\[
R^2 = (2.692 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 7.245 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2,
\]

\[
A = 4 \pi (7.245 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 7.245 \times 10^{14} \approx 9.098 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy
Using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

\[
S = \frac{A k c^3}{4 \hbar G}.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \(A = 9.098 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2\),
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),
- \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),
- \(G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\).

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A k c^3 = (9.098 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (1.38 \times 10^{-23}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^3.
\]

\[
(3 \times 10^8)^3 = 27 \times 10^{24} = 2.7 \times 10^{25}.
\]

\[
A k c^3 = (9.098 \cdot 1.38) \cdot 10^{15 - 23} \cdot 2.7 \times 10^{25}.
\]

\[
9.098 \cdot 1.38 \approx 12.45, \quad 12.45 \cdot 2.7 \approx 33.615.
\]

\[
A k c^3 \approx 33.615 \cdot 10^{15 - 23 + 25} = 33.615 \cdot 10^{17} = 3.3615 \times 10^{18}.
\]

Now, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}).
\]

\[
1.0545718 \cdot 6.6743 \approx 7.024, \quad 7.024 \times 10^{-34 - 11} = 7.024 \times 10^{-45}.
\]

\[
4 \hbar G = 4 \cdot 7.024 \times 10^{-45} = 28.096 \times 10^{-45} = 2.8096 \times 10^{-44}.
\]

Finally, calculate \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{3.3615 \times 10^{18}}{2.8096 \times 10^{-44}} = \left(\frac{3.3615}{2.8096}\right) \cdot 10^{18 + 44}.
\]

\[
\frac{3.3615}{2.8096} \approx 1.196, \quad S \approx 1.196 \times 10^{62} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

### Final Answer
The entropy of the black hole is approximately \(10^{62} \, \text{J/K}\), which corresponds to:

**Answer: A**
