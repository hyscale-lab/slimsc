Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some genetic constructs. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's parse the question. The setup involves creating a bicistronic vector with loxP sites and stop cassettes. The vector has two ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both are under different regulatory elements. The ligand uses the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES element upstream.

They introduced this construct into primary astrocyte cultures and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to check expression via Western blot. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. However, when they looked for green fluorescence (from eGFP), there was none. So why didn't the green signal show up?

Let's think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the setup here is about expression in the same cells, right? Because the vector is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cell. But wait, in the mice, if the Cre is SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, including perhaps astrocytes. So, if the ligand and receptor are both expressed in the same cells, it's autocrine, not paracrine. So I'm not sure if A is the issue, but it might not be the main problem here.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. eGFP is a fluorescent protein that should be secreted or membrane-associated, depending on the signal peptide. If the construct is stuck in the Golgi, it might not be expressed on the cell surface, so the fluorescence wouldn't be seen. But how would the Western blot look? The Western blot uses total proteins, so if the protein is made but stuck, it should still show up as a band. Unless the protein isn't being made at all. The question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, but it doesn't specify if the ligand or receptor proteins are detected. Wait, the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the ligand is expressed but the receptor isn't, or vice versa. But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so both ORFs should be present. But the issue is that after crossing with Cre, the cassettes are removed, allowing expression. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the receptor construct isn't being expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in that case, the vector's receptor and eGFP would still be under the stop, so no expression
