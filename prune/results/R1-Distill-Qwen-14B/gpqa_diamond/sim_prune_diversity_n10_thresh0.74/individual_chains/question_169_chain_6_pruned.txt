Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says that in a certain nuclear decay, two heavy nucleons of flavor A convert into two B's, emitting two E particles and two V particles. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It also mentions that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of the two V particles, the decay emits one exotic, massless particle M. I need to compare the energy spectrum of the E particles in this variant to the original decay.

Hmm, so the original decay has E and V particles. The variant has E and M. Wait, but wait, the original decay emits two E and two V. The variant emits two E and one M? Or is it that for the variant, maybe it's one E and one M? Wait, the problem says in the variant, they emit one M instead of the two V. Oh, wait, the original has 2V. The variant now has 1M. So the reaction would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, no, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The variant emits one M instead of the two V. So the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Oh, that's an important point.

So in the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. In the variant, two E and one M are emitted.

The question is about the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles. So in the original case, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. Now, what happens when the decay changes to emit M instead of two V particles.

I remember from my studies that in beta decay, when a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value of the reaction. But if other particles are involved, like if another particle is emitted, how does that affect the E spectrum?

Wait, but in this problem, the E particles are emitted along with V or M particles.

In the original decay, maybe E and V are the decay products. So the E particles carry away some energy, and V as well. But in the variant, E are still emitted, but now along with M.

Wait, but what are E and V? Are they like beta particles and neutrinos? Or maybe they are other types of particles. Well, in the original decay, E and V are emitted. The V's are much lighter, I think. Oh, the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B.

So the initial decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, with the E spectrum being continuous. Then the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M, where M is massless
