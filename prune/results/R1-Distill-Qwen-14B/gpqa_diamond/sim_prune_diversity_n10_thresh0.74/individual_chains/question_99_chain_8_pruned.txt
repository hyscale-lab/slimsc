Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options provided are four different structures, all of which are carboxylic acids since they end with COOH. My goal is to determine which one matches the given spectroscopic data.

First, let me go through the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since all the options are carboxylic acids, this makes sense because they have an -OH group. Also, a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids typically show a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The question states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So, the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, the protons aren't showing up (maybe because of symmetry or something else). All the options I see are carboxylic acids with branched structures, so no double bondsâ€”so that makes sense.

Next, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down. Splitting in NMR comes from neighboring (adjacent) protons.

Each splitting indicates the number of neighboring H's. For example, a triplet means two neighboring H's, a quartet means three, etc. But when you have multiple layers of splitting, you get more complex patterns.

So, the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's think about each splitting step:

- The quartet comes from being next to a group with three H's (like maybe a CH3 group attached to the same carbon as the H we're looking at).
- Then, the triplet would come from another neighboring group with two H's.
- The doublet would be due to a neighboring group with one H.

Wait, maybe I should think in the reverse order. Because each splitting is due to a neighboring group. So, if it's a quartet, that's J1, then a triplet (J2), then a doublet (J3). But I'm not entirely sure about the order.

Alternatively, perhaps each subsequent split is from a different set of neighboring protons. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure would have two CH groups each attached to ethyl groups and a central CH2. The COOH is on the end.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the COOH is on a carbon attached to two CH groups, each bearing ethyl groups and a CH2CH3 group.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So two CH groups each with methyl substituents, and a CH2COOH at the end.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So COOH is attached to a carbon that has two CH groups, each with a methyl and an ethyl perhaps?

Wait, maybe I should draw these structures to visualize.

For each option:

Option A: The structure would be something like CH2CH2CH2... Wait, no. Let me parse the formula. The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the main chain is CH2CH2...? No, wait, it's more like:

The molecule is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2-COOH

So, the backbone is a four-carbon chain, where the second and third carbons each have a CH group with ethyl substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the structure is CH2CH3 attached to the first carbon, then two CH groups each with ethyl substituents, then COOH.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So two CH groups each with methyl substituents, then a CH2COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the first carbon is CH2CH3, then two CH groups each with a methyl, and then COOH.

Wait, now I'm a bit confused. Let me try again.

Each option is a carboxylic acid where the COOH is on a carbon. The other carbons have varying substituents.

Looking at the NMR signals:

One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's think about what kind of protons would lead to such a splitting.

Each splitting comes from neighboring protons. So, for a quartet, the proton must be next to a CH3 group (3 H), then next to a CH2 group (2 H), and next to a CH group (1 H). But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is because the proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different number of Hs.

Wait, let me think of a scenario where a proton is adjacent to multiple different groups. For example, if the proton is on a central carbon that's connected to three different CH groups, each with different numbers of H.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has some branching that leads to multiple coupling partners.

Let me think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Looking at the options, some have more branching than others.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The structure would be:

CH2CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, because the formula is D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So, the carbons are arranged as CH2CH3-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

So, the central part
