Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it has some dark spots covering one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The star is being observed, and because of the spots, the brightness varies as it rotates, which could mimic the effect of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do. So, without the spots, what planet size would cause the same change in light.

Hmm. I remember that the brightness variation (the dip in light curve) when a planet transits is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is (Rp/Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, the spots on the star also cause a variation. So first, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the star's spots. They cover one hemisphere, but only 20% of that hemisphere is covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (for the hemisphere) multiplied by 0.2 (filling factor), which is 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface area.

But wait, no. Wait a second. The star's surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2*2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area covered by spots is 0.4πR², which is 0.1 of the entire star's surface (since 0.4πR² /4πR²=0.1), yeah, so 10% of the star's surface is spots.

Now, the spots are cooler. The star has Teff = 6000 K. The spots are Teff = 5000 K (since 6000 -1000 =5000). The flux from the spots is lower than the rest of the star.

The total flux from the star without spots would be L =4πR² σ T^4. But with spots, the flux is L = (1 - f)*L0 + f*L_spot, where f is the fractional area of the spots.

Wait, let's model this. The unspotted star emits with a certain flux. When the spots are present, the total flux from the star is reduced because the spots are cooler.

So, the star's normal flux per unit area is σ T^4. The spots' flux is σ (T-ΔT)^4, where ΔT is 100
