Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. The researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw the reactant spot diminish with two new spots. The question is about the possible structures of the products from the options A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they undergo an addition reaction. But wait, the starting material here isn't just an alkene; it's an ether. So the structure is benzene with an ether group where the oxygen is attached to a butenyl chain.

The starting compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me sketch this structure. The benzene ring is attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a butenyl group. The butenyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-...? Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 2. So the butenyl is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl. The structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-enyl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or is it but-1-enyl or something else? Maybe I should clarify the structure.

But-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, wait, but wait. Wait, butenyl has four carbons. So but-3-enyl would have a double bond starting at the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? That can't be right because but-3-enyl would be beyond the fourth carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C3? No, that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH, but that's not correct because the double bond can't be beyond the third carbon in a four-carbon chain. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but I need to place the double bond. The formula for but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O- attached to benzene. No, wait, that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Or but-1-en-4-yl? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH-O-? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2-O-benzene connected to a group that's CH2-C(CH3)2
