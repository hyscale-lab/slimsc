Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They're asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that when metal ions react with ligands, they form complexes. The stability constants, β, tell us how stable these complexes are. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So I think I need to calculate the different possible complexes and find out which one is the blue dithiocyanato, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ or something like that.

The given data is: [Co(II)] total is 1e-2 M, [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what each β corresponds to. Oh right, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, and so on.

So the complexes are:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)²+ (β1=9)

Co(SCN)²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂^2+ (β2=40, so overall β for Co(SCN)₂^2+ is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360?)

Wait, no, wait. Stability constants are for each step. So β1 is the formation of the first complex, β2 is the next step, etc. So for the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n, it's the product of β1 through βn.

Wait, no, wait again. No, βn is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. Oh, no, wait, stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. Oh, right, stepwise β is the constant for adding one ligand. So for Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+ (β1=9). Then CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+ (β2=40). So the overall β for the second complex is β1*β2=9*40=360. Similarly, the third complex (Co(SCN)3²+ would have β3=63, so overall β would be 9*40*63= 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680. And the fourth complex has β4=16, so overall β4=9*40*63*16= 22680 *16= 362880. Wait, but β4 is for the fourth complex, but what is the order? Because if you have four SCN⁻ ligands, the complex would be Co(SCN)_4²− or something else? Or maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{
