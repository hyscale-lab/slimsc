Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the most intense and is the molecular weight. There's also a peak at m/z 158, which is 32% abundance. Hmm, that's probably the molecular ion plus two, so maybe there's a chlorine involved because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35.5, so Cl2 would be 71, but wait, the difference is 2 between 156 and 158? Wait, wait, no. 158-156=2. So that suggests maybe deuterium or something else. But more likely, the chlorine might be causing a shift. Wait, chlorine has an isotope at about 35 and 37. So maybe the molecular ion is 156, and the 158 is due to the presence of Cl with its isotopic peaks.

So molecular weight is 156. Let me think about possible structures. The IR and NMR data will help.

Looking at the IR: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests either an O-H stretch (like in an acid or alcohol) or maybe an aldehyde's aldehyde proton. But wait, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. High wavenumbers around 1700 is usually a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit on the higher side, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have O-H stretches, but their carbonyl is around 1700-1725. So if there's a broad peak, that could be an O-H.

Wait, the IR's broad peak could also be from an alcohol, but the 1720 cm^-1 is more indicative of a carbonyl. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Because that would have both a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR: 11.0 ppm singlet (1H). That's very high, like an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12, so 11 fits. Also, the singlet suggests no neighboring protons, which makes sense for a carboxylic acid, since it's -COOH. But wait, what about -OH in an acid? Usually, the O-H in a carboxylic acid is a broad peak in the NMR, but the 11 ppm is a sharp singlet. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde with an adjacent electron-withdrawing group that deshields it more, pushing it up to 11 ppm.

Wait, the NMR also shows 8.02 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H) and 7.72 as another doublet (d, 2H). So that's a pair of doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para-substituted benzene rings, each set of protons is a doublet. For example, if you have substituents at positions 1 and 3 (meta), the coupling would be different. But in para, the two sets of protons are each a doublet integrating to two protons each.

So perhaps the structure is something like chlorobenzoic acid, where the substituents are in the para positions. Let me think. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the structure would have a Cl at position 4 (para) and a COOH group at position 1. Wait, no, that would put Cl and COOH on the same position? No, wait, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have the COOH group at position 1 (since benzoic acid is position 1), and Cl at position 4, which is para. So in that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating 2H. Because the ring would have two sets of protons, each as a doublet.

Let me think about the NMR. The downfield shift at 8.02 and 7.72 suggests electron-withdrawing groups. A carboxylic acid is definitely an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the aromatic protons. So, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons adjacent to COOH and Cl would be more deshielded.

But wait, let's look at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

So if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Let me think about the NMR shifts. The protons next to the COOH group (position 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, so they would appear downfield. The protons next to Cl (position 3 and 5) may also be deshielded, but Cl is a weaker de-shielder compared to COOH.

Wait, but in benzoic acid derivatives, the ortho and para protons tend to be deshielded. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, and Cl at position 4. Then, the positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be next to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) would be adjacent to Cl.

So the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be more deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher (more downfield). Similarly, protons next to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded, but maybe not as much as those next to COOH.

Wait, but in the NMR, the upfield proton is at 7.72 and downfield at 8.02. So maybe the higher ppm is the protons next to COOH, and the lower ppm could be the protons next to Cl? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons in the ortho positions (next to COOH) are more downfield. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have two sets of doublets: the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm, and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be at a lower ppm.

So in the NMR, 8.02 ppm is the ortho (COOH adjacent) and 7.72 is the meta (Cl adjacent). Does that make sense?

But wait, Cl is a de-shielding group as well, but less than COOH. So the protons next to Cl would be downfield, but not as much as those next to COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cl is at the para position relative to COOH. So let's look at the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So, positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So, the ring would have protons in positions 2,3,5,6. The 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In that case, the ortho protons (2 and 6) would be more downfield than the meta protons (3 and 5). So in the NMR, we'd have two doublets: one at higher ppm and one at lower.

In the given data, 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So the higher ppm (8.02) would be the ortho protons, and 7.72 would be the meta protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's think about substituent effects. COOH is a strong de-shielder, so the ortho protons would be more downfield. Cl is a weaker de-shielder, so the protons adjacent to Cl would be less downfield.

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ortho protons (to COOH) would be at higher ppm (8.02), and the meta protons (to Cl) would be at 7.72. That seems plausible.

Looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Now, let's check the molecular weight. COOH has a molecular weight of 98 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which is 12*7 + 1*6 + 16*2 + 1 (from the COOH) wait, no, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would add about 35.5.

So the molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: C=7*12=84, H=5*1=5, Cl=35.5, O=2*16=32. Total: 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156 (probably because the Cl could be the 35Cl isotope, but wait, 35Cl is the most abundant. So 35Cl contributes 35, so 84 +5 +35 +32 = 156. So molecular weight is 156 for the 35Cl version. But wait, the molecular ion peak is at 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). So 158 is 156 +2. That suggests the presence of Cl because Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% for 35Cl and 25% for 37Cl. So the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). But in the data, the molecular ion is 156 (100%) and then 158 at 32%. Wait, that doesn't quite add up because if it's 35Cl, the peak would be higher, and 37Cl would be about a quarter of that, but 32% is about a third. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156, which would correspond to the 35Cl isotope. The 37Cl would be 35+2=37, so 156 +2=158. So the peak at 158 should be about a quarter of the 156 peak if Cl is present once, because Cl has about 25% 37Cl. So 100% at 156, and 25% at 158. But the data shows 32% at 158. Hmm. That's a bit higher than expected, but perhaps the calculation is approximate. Alternatively, perhaps it's not Cl. Could it be another element?

Alternatively, the molecular formula could be something else. Let me see the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight would be 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. So total is 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So the m/z would be 156.5. So the molecular ion could be at 156 and 158. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another thought: the molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 could be due to the presence of a double bond or something else. Or perhaps it's a deuterated compound? But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is C8H7O2Cl. Wait, 12*8 is 96, 7 is 7, 35.5 is 35.5, 32 is 32. 96+7=103, +35.5=138.5, +32=170.5. That's not matching.

Wait, let's compute the options. Let's look at the options' molecular weights.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Formula: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So same as option B.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Same formula, same molecular weight.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCO-O-C6H5. Molecular formula: C8H7ClO2. So 8*12=96, 7=7, 35.5=35.5, 32=32. 96+7=103, +35.5=138.5, +32=170.5. So molecular ion would be around 170.5, but the given is 156. So option C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula: same as B and A, C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight same as others, 156.5.

So options A, B, D have the same molecular formula, so the molecular ion is 156, and the 158 is the 37Cl isotope. So 35Cl is 75% abundance, 37Cl is 25%. So the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The ratio would be approximately 75% : 25%, which is 3:1. But in the data, the 158 is at 32%, which is roughly a third of 100. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, but maybe the molecular ion is the M+• peak, and the 37Cl is 25% of the molecular ion. So 100% at 156, and 25% at 158. But the data shows 32% at 158, which is a bit higher. Maybe the data has some error, or perhaps the molecular ion isn't from Cl but from something else. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is different.

Wait, but 32% is about a third, which is 33%, close to 25%. Maybe it's approximate. So perhaps the peaks are M and M+2 for Cl.

So back to the IR and NMR.

Looking at the NMR again: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H). If it's a carboxylic acid, that's the -OH proton. But wait, the -OH in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, right? But in the NMR data, it's a singlet. So is that possible? Or maybe it's not an -OH but something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the peak at 11 ppm is an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but maybe in some cases they can be a bit higher. But an aldehyde would not have a broad peak in the IR. Wait, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. So that could be an aldehyde (RCHO) or a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

If the proton is at 11 ppm, that's a bit high for an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group like an acid.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would usually be a broad peak, but in the data, it's a singlet. That seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the sample is deuterated? Or maybe it's an exchange with D2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the 11 ppm peak isn't an O-H but an aldehyde. But then, why is there a broad peak in the IR? Oh, wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1, which could be an O-H stretch. So maybe it's an acid.

But the NMR's 11 ppm is a singlet. Hmm. Wait, maybe the -OH is exchanging and not showing up as a broad peak. Or perhaps it's a different proton.

Wait, another thought: what about a chloroformate? Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is ClCO-O-C6H5. Its structure would have an ester group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl, which phenyl chloroformate would have. But the NMR...

Phenyl chloroformate would have the ester group, so the carbonyl is at about 170 ppm perhaps. The NMR would have a singlet for the OCH2Cl group? No, wait, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5. So the O is connected to Cl and the phenyl. So the structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the protons on the benzene ring would be as in para positions if the substituents are in para.

Wait, but the molecular formula for option C is C8H7ClO2, which would have a molecular weight of 170.5, but the given molecular ion is 156. So option C is out.

So back to the other options. Let's consider the NMR again.

The 11.0 ppm is a singlet. Let's think about what else that could be. Maybe an aromatic aldehyde proton? Wait, but in that case, the IR would have a peak for the aldehyde. The IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720, which is more like a carboxylic acid or an ester. But if it's an aldehyde, the peak would be around 2800 (stretching for the aldehyde C-H). Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a ketone? But 11 ppm is way too high for a ketone, which is usually around 2-3 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of an aromatic ring with strong de-shielding. Like an aromatic proton. But 11 ppm is extremely high for a regular aromatic proton. Typically, aromatic protons are around 6-8.5 ppm. Unless there's a strong electron-withdrawing group attached. For example, a nitro group could cause the adjacent protons to be more downfield, but 11 ppm is still very high.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a nitro group, but the IR doesn't have a peak around 1500 that would indicate NO2. The IR given shows a strong peak at 1720, which is the carbonyl.

So, perhaps the 11 ppm peak isn't an aromatic proton. Let me think about another possibility.

Wait, in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet, integrating to 1H. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but as I mentioned earlier, the -OH proton would usually be a broad peak, not a singlet.

Wait, another angle: the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a broad stretch, which could be due to an O-H group, maybe in an acid or an alcohol. But the 1720 is a strong sharp peak, which is a carbonyl.

So, putting it together: a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid) and an O-H group. So the NMR's 11 ppm is the -OH proton.

But why is it a singlet and sharp? Well, I guess in some cases, the -OH can appear as a singlet if it's not exchanging rapidly or if the solution is not in D2O. But usually, in NMR, the -OH proton in a carboxylic acid is a broad peak due to exchange with water. So perhaps the sample was measured under conditions that caused the -OH to appear as a sharp singlet? Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm peak isn't the -OH, but something else. Let me think about the other NMR signals. The 8.02 and 7.72 peaks, each a doublet with 2H, suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So the molecule is likely a substituted benzoic acid or benzaldehyde.

Wait, let me think about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl at position 3, OH at position 2, and aldehyde at position 1.

So the aromatic ring would have substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). That's a meta-substituted ring. So the protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Wait, no, position 1 has an aldehyde, position 2 has OH, position 3 has Cl. So the ring would have substituents at 1,2,3, which is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. That would make the ring have two doublets and a triplet or something else. But the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted ring, like 4-chlorobenzoic acid, then the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), making the ring para-substituted, leaving positions 2,3,5,6 as H's. These would split into two doublets. So that fits the NMR.

So, the 11 ppm peak would be the -COOH proton. But in that case, why is it a singlet and sharp? Maybe the sample is not in D2O, and the exchange is slow, leading to a sharp peak. Or perhaps it's a deuterated compound, but the question didn't mention that.

Now, looking at the IR: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The strong sharp peak at 1720 would be the carbonyl.

So, putting it all together, the structure is likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid, option B.

Wait, but let's check the options. Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So, substituent positions are 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2 (ortho). The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. In this case, the aromatic protons would not be two doublets. Because in ortho substitution, the ring's protons would couple differently.

Wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring would have H's at positions 3,4,5,6. The H at position 3 is next to Cl and between COOH and Cl. Position 4 is meta to COOH and adjacent to position 5, which is next to Cl. This would probably result in more complex splitting than two doublets. So the NMR would not have just two doublets each integrating for 2H. Hence, option D is less likely.

Therefore, the structure is more likely 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), which explains the para substitution leading to two doublets in the NMR, and the other spectral data.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)** and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest the presence of chlorine, as the isotopic abundance of chlorine (35Cl: 75%, 37Cl: 25%) aligns with the observed peaks. The molecular weight is approximately **156**, and the molecular formula is deduced to be **C₇H₅ClO₂** based on the options provided.

### IR Analysis:
- A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of the acidic proton (-OH) in a carboxylic acid. While -OH protons are typically broad, the sharp singlet here may result from slow exchange or specific experimental conditions.
- Two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H)** suggest a **para-substituted aromatic ring**, as the splitting pattern arises from coupling in a symmetric para-substitution.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This structure has a 1,2,3-trisubstituted aromatic ring, which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR. The observed two doublets do not match this structure.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure has a para-substitution pattern with -COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. The aromatic protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to -COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (meta to -COOH) would produce two doublets in the NMR, consistent with the observed splitting. The molecular formula and spectral data align perfectly with this structure.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This structure (ClCO-O-C₆H₅) has a molecular formula of **C₈H₇ClO₂**, which corresponds to a molecular weight of **170.5**. This does not match the given molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**, so this option is eliminated.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This structure has -COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 2 (ortho substitution). The resulting aromatic protons would not produce the observed two doublets, as the splitting pattern would be more complex due to the asymmetry of the ortho substitution.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR, and NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the NMR splitting, and the molecular formula matches the given data.

**Answer: B**
