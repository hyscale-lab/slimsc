Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

The question presents three different reactions (A, B, and C), each involving Michael addition, and we need to match the reactants with the correct products from the options provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for each part.

First, let's recall what a Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacking a beta-carbon in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, and the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the electrophilic part. So the enolate adds to the beta position, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Looking at reaction A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So, dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile? Or wait, no, dimethyl malonate is a compound that can form an enolate. Since it's a diester, it's a good source of an enolate, acting as the nucleophile in a Michael addition.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate is at the 3-position with a p-tolyl group. The E configuration means the substituents are opposite each other. So, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the part that will be attacked.

The reaction conditions are NaOEt in EtOH, which is a base. NaOEt will deprotonate the alpha position of dimethyl malonate, forming an enolate. The enolate will then attack the beta carbon (the position next to the carbonyl) of the acrylate.

Wait, but dimethyl malonate is H2C(COOR)2. So, its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would form at the CH2 group, making it a strong nucleophile. Then, it attacks the beta position of the acrylate.

The acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR with a p-tolyl group attached. Wait, no: the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the 3-position. Wait, actually, the structure might be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but at position 3, which is the beta position relative to the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-
