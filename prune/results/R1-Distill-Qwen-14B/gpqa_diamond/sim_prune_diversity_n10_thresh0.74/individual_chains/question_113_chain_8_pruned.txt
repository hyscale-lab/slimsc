Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me read through the question carefully. The question states that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each of these techniques is provided, and I need to match it to one of the four given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let's start with the FTIR spectrum. The question mentions a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region typically indicates the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, there's also another peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ and another at 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). But what about 1650? That's a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone or aldehyde. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a conjugated ketone, or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substitution.

Next, looking at the ¹H NMR data. The problem states that there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. Also, the presence of these H's suggests that the compound isn't fully hydrogenated, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone with an alkene nearby.

Then, the Mass Spectrometry part shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm. The m/z 45 is a key here. I should think about what fragments could give this. Common fragments with m/z 45 include the molecular ion of certain compounds. For instance, the fragment could be a CH₂COOH group or something similar. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO, which has a molecular weight of 44... wait, maybe another possibility). Alternatively, the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group or something else. Let me think. The formula for 45 is... Well, 45 divided by 12 is 3.75, so maybe C3H9O or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2O group? Wait, (CH3)2O would be 45 (since (2*15) + 12 = 42? No, wait: (CH3)2O is (O and two CH3). So O has 16, each CH3 is 15 (12+3). So 16 + 2*15 = 16 +30=46. Hmm, not matching. Maybe I should think of the formula for 45. Let's see: possible combinations. 45 can be C3H7O (since 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16; 36+7+16=60?), no. Wait, maybe it's a different approach. The m/z 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH2CO+ (which is 45: 12+2 +12+16=43? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, perhaps the molecular ion of acetic acid? Acetic acid is C2H4O2, molecular weight 60. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's a part of the molecule. Another possibility: could it be a ketene group (O=C=O) but that's heavier. Alternatively, maybe a CH2=CH-O- group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a (CH3)2CO group, but wait, that would be 58. Hmm.

Let me think about the options given. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Let's write down their molecular formulas and see:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) = 72 +12 +32 = 116.

B) C6H10O: 6*12=72; 10=10; O=16. So 72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

Now, the mass spec. fragment is at 45. If the molecular ion is, say, 100 (D), then a fragment of 45 would imply a loss of 55, which seems a bit arbitrary. Alternatively, for option C (114), a fragment at 45 would mean the rest is 69. That might be possible. Alternatively, for option A (116), a fragment of 45 would leave 71. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the base peak in mass spec is the molecular ion. But in this case, the question says the fragment is at 45, which may not be the molecular ion. So perhaps the molecular ion is higher, but a fragment breaks off to give 45.

Looking for a functional group that would produce a fragment with m/z 45. Another possibility is that the compound has an acetyl group (CH3CO-), which is 43. But the fragment is 45, so maybe it's a CH2CO2 group or something else.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. Let me think about the IR data. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is lower, so perhaps conjugation. For example, an ester group (O=C-O-) would show a carbonyl around 1700-1750, but if it's conjugated, maybe the peak is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substitution, but that's another story.

Wait, the O-H peak in IR is very broad around 3000. This could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak is usually very broad and around 2500-3300, which fits the description. But then, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl peak around 1700, which is what's observed. But wait, I'm not sure because the presence of a carboxylic acid would require at least two O's, right? Because the formula would have O2.

Looking at the options, the compounds with O2 are A, C, and D has O. Wait, D is C6H12O, so only one oxygen. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would need
