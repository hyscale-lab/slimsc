Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we've got an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each gives a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

Wait, I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh right! For a dipole, the radiation pattern is not isotropic. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on θ. The formula I recall is something like the radiation pattern being proportional to (sin²θ) or maybe (cosθ) squared, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, no, the intensity in dipole radiation peaks in the plane perpendicular to the dipole. So the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). The formula I think is I is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum intensity would be when sinθ is 1, which is at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Oh, maybe it's a dipole oscillating along the z-axis. If the charge distribution is spheroidal and symmetric along z, perhaps it's an oscillating dipole. So the dipole moment oscillates, causing radiation.

In dipole radiation, the intensity (power per unit area) in the far zone is given by the formula:

I = ( (μ₀ μ² ω⁴ sin²θ) ) / (12π c³ )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Alternatively, I think the power radiated per unit solid angle (which is the same as intensity) is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. So the maximum intensity is when θ=90, and the intensity there is like the peak value.

But in the question
