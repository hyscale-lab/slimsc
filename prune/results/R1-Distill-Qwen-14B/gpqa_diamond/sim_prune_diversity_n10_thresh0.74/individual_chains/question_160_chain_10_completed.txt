Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called maxima and minima. 

The problem says the aperture is a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) are the same length 'a'. When monochromatic light (wavelength λ) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, the angles are small, so tan(theta) ≈ theta can be used.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this problem simplifies to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

But wait, the options include some numbers, and I remember that the first minimum for a single slit (which is a circular case) is given by a specific formula. Oh right, for a single slit of width 'a', the first minimum occurs at sin(theta) = λ/a. Since the angle is small, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so theta ≈ λ/a. But wait, that's the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in a single slit, the first minimum is the first dark spot, and the next minima are higher order. Wait, no, the single-slit diffraction has only one minimum between the central maximum, or multiple? Wait, no, no. Let me think. Single-slit diffraction has a central bright spot, then the first dark fringe is the first minimum, then another bright, then the second dark, etc. So actually, in the far field, the intensity minima occur at (m+1/2)λ/a, where m is 0,1,2,... So the first minimum is at 1.5λ/(2a) = λ/(2a * 0.5) wait, no. Wait, the formula I remember for the minima in single-slit is a sin(theta) = mλ, where m is 0,1,2,... But wait, for the minima in single-slit, the formula is a sin(theta) = mλ, but wait no, wait no, I think it's different. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the single-slit diffraction minima occur where a sin(theta) = mλ, with m=1,2,3,... The first minimum is at m=1, so sin(theta) = λ/a. But wait, that's for the minima. So the angle of the first minimum is theta1 = λ/a, but since theta is small, we can approximate it as theta ≈ λ/a.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in the single-slit case, the minima are not equally spaced because theta increases as m increases. Or are they? Let me think again. For small angles, theta ≈ mλ/a, because for each m, theta is approximately mλ/a. So the first minimum is at m=1, theta=λ/a. Second minimum at m=2, theta=2λ/a. So the angular distance between them would be (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are like 0.5 or 0.61 times λ/a.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh wait, the problem is about an aperture that's a polygon with N sides, and when N is large, it becomes a circle. So perhaps it's about a circular aperture, which is a different case. Because the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different from a single slit.

Wait, right, a circular aperture produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy disk. The central maximum is surrounded by rings of minima and maxima. But the question is about the first two minima. Wait, no, the Airy pattern's first dark ring is the first minimum. But that's a ring, so the minima occur at certain angles. Wait, but in the far field, the intensity patterns for a circular aperture have their minima at specific angles, determined by the Bessel function zeros.

Hmm, the minima for a circular aperture occur where the Bessel function J1 has its zeros. The first minimum occurs at J1(k a sinθ) = 0, where k is 2π/λ. So the zeros of J1 are at certain points. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, so the condition is a sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the formula for the m-th minimum in a circular aperture is a sinθ = (x_m) λ/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. The first zero (m=1) is at x_1 ≈ 3.8317. So the first minimum is at sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. Wait, but that's the position of the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second is the next dark ring. So the positions would be θ1 = x1 λ/(2π a) and θ2 = x2 λ/(2π a), where x1 is 3.8317 and x2 is 7.0156.

So the angular separation between them is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839) λ/(2π a). Let me compute that: 3.1839/(2π) ≈ 3.1839/6.2832 ≈ 0.506. So the separation is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The problem says the polygon has N sides and all apothems are of length 'a'. When N is very large, the figure approaches a circle with radius 'a' (since the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle). So in that case, the diameter is 2a, but wait, wait. Wait, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which for a regular polygon is given by (s/(2 tan(π/N))), where 's' is the side length. But perhaps for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle, so the radius R of the circumscribed circle is a / cos(π/N). But when N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the polygon becomes a circle of radius a.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. So the radius R of the polygon (distance from center to a vertex) is a / cos(π/N). But for a circle, the radius is the same as the apothem. Wait, no, wait. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, so yes, it's the inradius. So when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle with inradius a. So the radius of the circle is a. That's correct. Hence, the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but when the light passes through a circular aperture of radius a, the diffraction pattern is an Airy disk. So the minima in the far field are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a, which matches the first option. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, if the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) (which is 0.61 λ/a), and the second minimum is at θ2 ≈ 2.404 λ/(2a) (since the second zero of J1 is at x ≈ 2.404, wait no, no, wait. Wait, J1 has its first zero at x ≈ 3.8317. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me get the zero points right.

Wait, the zeros for the Bessel function J_m occur at specific points. For J_1, the first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second at x ≈ 7.0156, third at x ≈ 10.1735, etc. So for the circular aperture of radius a, the m-th minimum occurs at θ_m = x_m * (λ/(2a)), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. 

So the first minimum (m=1) is at θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2a) ≈ 1.91585 λ/a. Wait, but wait, wait, let me think again. The formula I've seen is a sinθ = x_m λ/(2π), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So θ ≈ x_m λ/(2π a) for small angles. So for m=1, x_m ≈ 3.8317, so θ1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. Oh, because 3.8317/(2π) is approximately 0.61.

Similarly, the second zero (m=2) is x2≈7.0156. So θ2 = 7.0156 λ/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) ≈ 1.116 λ/a.

So the angular separation between the first and second minima is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) * λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but the question says "the angular distance between the first two minima". Wait, but in the Airy pattern, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the next is the second. So the difference between their angles would be approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer should be option D.

But wait, let me think again: when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. So the first minima occur at θ = 0.610 λ/a, and the second at 1.116 λ/a. The separation is about 0.506 λ/a, so the answer is D.

Wait, but the options given include C) 1.220 λ/a. I'm trying to remember where 1.22 comes from. Oh right, the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction is at a sinθ = λ, so θ ≈ λ/a, but that's for a single slit. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, wait, in single-slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,3..., so the first minimum is at θ ≈ λ/a. But that's a different scenario because here the aperture is a polygon which becomes a circle, so the diffraction pattern is different.

So in the circular case, the angular separation is approximately 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.


The problem involves a polygonal aperture with N sides, where all apothems are of length \(a\). When N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle with radius \(a\). Monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda\) falling vertically on this aperture creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. The goal is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in this pattern.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The minima occur at angles where \(a \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2\pi}\), where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). The first zero of \(J_1\) is \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero is \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the angles of the first and second minima are approximately:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a} \quad \text{and} \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The angular separation between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\) and \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Approximating \(\frac{3.1839}{2\pi} \approx 0.506\), the angular separation is:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. For example, \(1.220 \lambda/a\) corresponds to the first minimum in single-slit diffraction, which is not relevant here.
