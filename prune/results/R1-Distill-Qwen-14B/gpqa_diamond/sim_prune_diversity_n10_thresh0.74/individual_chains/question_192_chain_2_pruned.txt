Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture it. So there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity, which means it's like a hollow sphere inside the conductor. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the conductor is bigger than the cavity.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to find which one is correct.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and electric fields. When a conductor is neutral, charges can move freely. But if you put a charge inside a cavity in a conductor, what happens? Oh right, the conductor's inner surface will induce a charge. But wait, the conductor itself is uncharged, so the total charge on it must be zero.

So, if you have a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. But wait, is that right? Because the conductor was initially uncharged. So yes, the inner surface gets -q, outer +q.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So, for points outside a conductor, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's due to the shell theorem, right? So the electric field outside a spherical shell of charge depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

In this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So, at a point outside, the electric field should be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because the field from the inner induced charges doesn't affect outside points.

So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², since L is the
