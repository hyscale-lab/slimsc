Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pericyclic reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves three different reactions, each being a sigmatropic rearrangement. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements are pericyclic reactions where a sigma bond moves, typically with the pi bond shifting. The specific types mentioned are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the first reaction might be something else, like a Claisen rearrangement, or maybe another type.

Let's look at the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A. Hmm. Claisen rearrangement usually involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But here, the starting material is different. Wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine.

Wait, but Claisen rearrangement is about vinyl ethers. Alternatively, maybe this is a Cope rearrangement. Or perhaps another type of pericyclic reaction. Wait, the problem says all three are sigmatropic rearrangements. So the first one must also be a sigmatropic shift.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an acid-catalyzed reaction. The presence of H+ suggests an acid. The starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me think about its structure. It's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So structure: CH2-C(OCH3)2-NH2? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine would be CH3CH2NH2. But with 1,1-dimethoxy substitution: so the amine is on C1, which also has two methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2. That's more like it. So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2.

Wait, but with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2
