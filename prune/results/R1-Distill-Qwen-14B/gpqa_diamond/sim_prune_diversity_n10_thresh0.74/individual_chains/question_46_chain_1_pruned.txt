Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene that facilitates this process, probably in a ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule is chiral, but wait, wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl at the third carbon. Wait, 3-methyl pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait. Let me count. Pent means five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3) no, wait, that's 3-methylpentene. Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So if it's 3-methyl, then the structure is CH2=
