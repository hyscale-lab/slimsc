Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is being overexpressed. The researcher is having trouble getting the protein expressed as expected. They modified the gene to add a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't overexpressing. They looked at the plus strand sequence and noticed an issue.

Hmm, looking at the options, the possible issues could be a mutation in the HA tag, translation termination early, proteolysis due to lack of linker, or a tRNA issue for UAA.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me check the sequence given.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, correct. Then TAC is tyrosine. Hmm, wait, but the HA tag is from the influenza hemagglutinin. The HA tag is typically a specific sequence, maybe around 10 amino acids. So if the HA sequence is missing or mutated, that might cause a problem. But option A says the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA tag is incorrect, leading to the protein not being recognized for purification, but the question is about overexpression, not purification. Hmm, but the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So if the HA sequence is wrong, maybe the protein is not expressed because of a frameshift or stop codon?

Wait, looking at the sequence, let me scan for any in-frame stop codons. The reading frame is from ATG onwards. So each codon is three nucleotides. Let's check for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence: after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), etc. Let's go through the sequence step by step.

The sequence is: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... Wait, hold on. Let's look for the stop codon.

Wait, after the initial part, I see 'TGA' in there. Let me find it. Let me parse the sequence in triplets.

Starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A...

So the triplet after AAA is TGA. TGA is a stop codon. Oh, wait. So the coding sequence includes a TGA codon, which is a stop. So the stop codon occurs in the middle of the gene. That would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein, not overexpression.

Wait, but the original gene probably doesn't have that. So the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence. How did that happen?

Ah, perhaps when they introduced the HA tag, they inserted it incorrectly, leading to a frameshift or an introduced stop codon. Or maybe the HA sequence itself has a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is supposed to be a short peptide. Let's say the HA tag is, for example, YPYDHH (from HA tag sequences I remember). So if they added a sequence that introduced a stop codon early on, that would be a problem.

In this case, the plus strand's sequence shows that there's a TGA in the coding sequence, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would translate until that point and stop, resulting in a truncated protein. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not being made—only the part before the stop.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated early. That fits because of the TGA stop codon.

So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to early termination. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Other options: A) HA has a mutation—maybe, but the main issue is the stop codon. C) Proteolysis due to linker absence—could be another issue, but the initial problem is no expression, not degradation. D) No tRNA for UAA—unlikely since UAA is a stop codon and it's present as TGA here.


The question involves a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus for overexpression. The researcher observes that the protein is not being overexpressed and examines the sequence of the plus strand of the construct. The sequence provided contains the start codon (ATG) but also includes the triplet **TGA** further downstream. This is a stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated protein and preventing proper overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: While a mutation in the HA tag could cause issues, the primary problem here is the presence of a stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence, which directly prevents full-length protein expression. This makes option A less likely to be the main issue.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is consistent with the presence of the TGA stop codon in the sequence, which would lead to premature termination of translation and explain the lack of overexpression.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: Proteolysis typically occurs after the protein is expressed, but the issue here is the absence of full-length protein due to early termination. Therefore, this is not the primary cause.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: While this could theoretically affect translation, the sequence contains TGA, not UAA, as the stop codon. Additionally, TGA is a well-recognized stop codon in mammalian systems, making this option unlikely.

The most likely explanation is that the TGA stop codon in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing proper overexpression of the protein.

Answer: B
