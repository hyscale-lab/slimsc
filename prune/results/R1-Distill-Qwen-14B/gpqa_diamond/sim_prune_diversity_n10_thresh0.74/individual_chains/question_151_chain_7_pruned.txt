Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. Alright, I've studied a bit about this, so let me try to think it through.

The problem states that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, wait a second. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, meaning its norm (or length) should be 1. So I should probably check that first. Because without normalization, the probabilities won't add up to 1, which is necessary.

So the state vector is a column matrix, so let's denote it as |Ïˆ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The norm of this vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. Let me calculate that. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. The norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the state isn't normalized. But wait, before I proceed, do I need to normalize it for calculating probabilities? Because in quantum mechanics, measurements depend on the state being a unit vector. So I think I should normalize the state vector first.

Wait, the observable is given by the matrix P. The problem asks for the probability that the measurement yields 0. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables correspond
