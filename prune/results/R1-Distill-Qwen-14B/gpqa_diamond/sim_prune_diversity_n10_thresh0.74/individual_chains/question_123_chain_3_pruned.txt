Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with motion between different reference frames, especially when they're moving relative to each other, I might need to use the concept of relative velocity or maybe even special relativity. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward relative velocity problem.

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse this carefully.

So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy (specifically, the center) is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Because both are inertial frames, I think this is a case where I can apply the concept of relative velocity.

Wait, but wait. If the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at the same speed towards the Galaxy. Because velocities are relative. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But wait, let me think about frames. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, then the ejecta must be moving towards the Galaxy
