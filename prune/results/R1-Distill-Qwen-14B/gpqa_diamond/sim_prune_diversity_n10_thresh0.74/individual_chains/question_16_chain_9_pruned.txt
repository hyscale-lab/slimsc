Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity... I remember that's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And for that to happen, the compound must have a chiral center, or maybe some other form of asymmetry like a planar chirality. But wait, not all chiral centers automatically mean optical activity, right? Because sometimes there's a plane of symmetry or other factors. Let me think through each compound one by one.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are from A to D, with the numbers 5,3,2,4 as the possible counts. I think I'll go through each compound step by step.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-... Wait, no, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl on C1, a methyl on
