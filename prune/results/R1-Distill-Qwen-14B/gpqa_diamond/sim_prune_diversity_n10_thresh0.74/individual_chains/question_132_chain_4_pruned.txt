Okay, so I've got this NMR question in front of me, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, first, I should probably figure out what the structures of the options look like. Let me list out each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl. So both have four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4. Again, four methyl groups each.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethyl. Wait, diethyl would be ethyl groups, right, so that's two methyl groups per ethyl.

Option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5. Both are tetramethyl.

So the molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. Let me check each structure.

Take 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. The benzene has methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. So that's four methyl groups, each as CH3. So each of these structures has four methyl groups, except maybe some where substituents are adjacent or not.

Wait, the diethyl benzene (like 1,4-diethylbenzene) would have two ethyl groups on the ring. So each ethyl is CH2CH3. So in total, that would be 8 carbons (from two ethyl groups) plus the benzene (6 carbons) making 8+6=14... No, wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5. Two ethyl groups add 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens. So 6 + 4 = 10 carbons. Hydrogens: benzene has 6, each ethyl has 5 (since one is attached to the ring), so 6 + 2*(5) = 16. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have a formula of C8H10? Because each ethyl is (CH2CH3) and two of them would be 4 carbons. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Two ethyl substituents would add 4 C and 10 H, but the benzene's H is 6. Wait, when substituents are attached, they take up H positions. Each substitution removes a H from the benzene.

So for each substituent X, the formula is C6H
