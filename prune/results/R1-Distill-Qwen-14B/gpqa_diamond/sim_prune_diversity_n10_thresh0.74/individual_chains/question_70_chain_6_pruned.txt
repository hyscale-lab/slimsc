Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step. I'm going to try to figure it out by breaking down each part of the question.

First, the problem describes several reactions, and I need to figure out what's going on in each step to identify the compounds involved. The big question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E, which is extremely hazardous. The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. So, I'll need to find out what E is and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by listing out the reactions mentioned.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let's see. I need to figure out what A, B, C, D, etc., are.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). I'm thinking about reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio. One possibility that comes to mind is something like the reaction between a metal and a diatomic gas. For example, maybe solid sulfur reacting with oxygen? Wait, sulfur is a solid, but when it reacts with O2, it forms SO2 or SO3. Wait, but the product here is bright red. Red solid—maybe something like sulfur trioxide? Wait, no, sulfur trioxide is a liquid. Or maybe it's a transition metal reacting with something.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur, and B is oxygen gas. Then, 8 equivalents would imply a stoichiometric ratio. Let me think: S (solid) + O2 (gas) → SO3 (maybe). But wait, when sulfur is burned, it forms SO2, which is a gas. But if it's a solid reacting with O2, perhaps it's another scenario. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is chlorine gas? Let's think: metals reacting with Cl2. For example, Fe reacts with Cl2 upon heating to form FeCl3. But 8 equivalents—maybe it's a 1:3 ratio? So, 8 moles of Cl2 for each mole of Fe? Hmm, but wait, the formula would be something else. Alternatively, if A is Fe and B is Cl2, the reaction would be 2Fe + 3Cl2 → 2FeCl3. So 3 moles of Cl2 per 2 moles Fe, which would be 3/2 per mole of Fe. Not 8 equivalents. So maybe not that.

Another possibility: maybe A is a metal oxide. For example, FeO (iron(II) oxide) reacting with Cl2? Not sure. Let me think about the product C. It's bright red. I'm trying to think of red compounds. Sulfur trioxide isn't red; maybe it's something else. Oh, wait! Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another angle:
