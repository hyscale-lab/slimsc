Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing two energies: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom with a specific wavelength.

Hmm, first, I remember that paramagnetic coupling involves the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The term is usually associated with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. Oh right, that's the Zeeman effect maybe? But wait, the question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term, so maybe it's a bit different.

Wait, the question gives that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which is the z-axis. And m is small. Oh right, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. So m can be -l, -l+1,..., 0,..., l. For small m, perhaps the splitting is not too large compared to other energy scales. But I'm not sure yet.

The problem is asking about the order of magnitude comparison between the average of the Hamiltonian (⟨H⟩) for the paramagnetic term and the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much larger, much smaller, or similar to ΔE.

I need to find expressions for both terms. Let's start with the paramagnetic coupling term. The Hamiltonian for the interaction of a magnetic moment with a magnetic field is given by H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton multiplied by the magnetic quantum number. Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e), where e is the electron charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_e is the electron mass.

The magnetic moment due to orbital motion is μ = μ_B * m, where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, orbital magnetic moment is actually μ = -μ_B * m, but since we're taking the magnitude, the sign might not matter here. But the energy would be H = -μ·B. Since B is along the z-axis, this simplifies to H = -μ_z B. So substituting μ_z, that's H = -μ_B m B.

Wait, but in the case of orbital magnetism, the energy shift would be proportional to m. So ⟨H⟩ would be something like μ_B * m * B. Wait, maybe the formula is ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * m * B. Let me think. So the energy term is ΔE_para = μ_B * m * B.

Now, for the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. I know that the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0
