Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. And from spectroscopy, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. The question is asking about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity (L) of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh wait, right, and the peak wavelength at which a black body emits most strongly is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K).

The problem says that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. So, λ_max for both is the same. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature (λ_max = b/T), if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same because λ_max is b/T. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but wait. There's also that part about radial velocities. Oh, right, because the stars are moving, there's a Doppler shift effect. The observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength. So the observed wavelengths might have shifted, but in the problem, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

Wait, so the observed λ_max for both is the same. Let me think. The rest frame λ_max is given by Wien's law. But when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. The Doppler shift formula is: λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no
