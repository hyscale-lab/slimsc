Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. Let's break down the information given.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is given as 31.96%. Wait, oF probably stands for oxidation number or maybe oxygen-free? Hmm, no, more likely oxidation state of fluorine. Oh right, oxidation number. So the oxidation state of F in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, that can't be right because oxidation states are integers. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage composition. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in A2. Let me think. Oh, maybe the 'ɷF' stands for the formula or something else. Alternatively, perhaps oF refers to the oxidation state, but 31.96% is in terms of mass, not charge. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the percentage is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2. Let's suppose that. So, A2 is a compound where fluorine makes up about 31.96% by mass.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction might be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let's write that as a chemical equation. But wait, decomposition usually involves breaking down into simpler substances. So if A1 is a fluorine compound, it's breaking into A2 (another fluorine compound) and F2 gas.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds, especially those with high oxidation states, are often oxidizing agents. For example, F2 itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but maybe A1 is something like a peroxide or a higher fluoride.

Moving on, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So Y is some element that forms a binary compound with F. A3 is a product of Y and F, so maybe YF3 or something similar.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably a salt that breaks down in water, maybe into an acid and a base or something else.

Our task is to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me think about possible candidates for Y. Since the compounds are binary with fluorine, Y could be a metal or a non-metal. But fluorine usually forms compounds with metals as YF, YF2, YF3, etc. Alternatively, Y could be a non-metal, like O, but that's more speculative.

But let's think about the decomposition of A1. When it decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So A1 must contain fluorine in a higher oxidation
