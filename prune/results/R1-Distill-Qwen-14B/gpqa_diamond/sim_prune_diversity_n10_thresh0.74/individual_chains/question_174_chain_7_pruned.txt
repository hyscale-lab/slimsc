Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Wait, that's a huge energy, but okay. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. So, the masses are in a 2:1 ratio.

The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh, so the initial mass M is 100%, and the two fragments add up to 99% of that. That means some mass is lost, right? Because in fission, some mass is converted into energy. So, that energy would be the kinetic energy of the fragments or other forms, but in this problem, we're just dealing with the two fragments.

So, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta that cancel each other out.

Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2. According to the problem, m1 is twice m2. So, m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M. So, the masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

Since the system is at rest, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2, but in opposite directions. So, m1 v1 = - m2 v2. Or, if I take magnitudes, m1 v1 = m2 v2. Hmm, but wait, because of the opposite directions, I can set up velocities accordingly.

Wait, but the kinetic energy depends on velocity, so maybe I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

The total energy after fission must be equal to the initial rest mass energy, but wait, no. Because in reality, some energy is released as kinetic energy. Wait, but the initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy would be the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies.

Wait, no. Let's think: initial energy is E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the energy is E_final = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) ), where K1 and K2 are the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

But because the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum must be zero. So, the momentum of m1 must equal the momentum of m2 in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (if direction is considered, but for momentum, it's
