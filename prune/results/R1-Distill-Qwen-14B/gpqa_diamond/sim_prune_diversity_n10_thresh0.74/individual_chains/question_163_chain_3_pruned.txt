Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can react with a strong acid like HCl. 

First, I think I'll need to write the reaction equation. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it should form its conjugate acid. Wait, Fe(OH)3 is actually a weak base, so the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, no, more accurately, the acid H+ would donate a proton to the hydroxide. So each OH- would take a H+. So the balanced equation would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

Right, because HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of HCl.

Now, the problem gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. So I need to find out how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let's calculate. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.

Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17 (1 H and 16 O). So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol, or about 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M (molar), which means 0.1 moles per liter. Wait, the problem says 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters. But wait, the total volume is 100 cm³, but the acid volume is what's needed. Hmm, so I think I just need the volume of HCl needed to provide the required moles, regardless of the total solution volume. Or wait, wait, the acid is being added to 100 cm³ of solution, so the total moles of HCl would determine the volume needed.

So, moles of HCl needed is 0.002808. The concentration is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So volume = moles / concentration.

Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So liters = moles / M.

So volume (in liters) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L. To convert to cm³, multiply by 1000, so 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. Hmm, but let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me redo the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845
