Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked with TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the options could be the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it's typically an addition reaction, following the mechanism of acid-catalyzed electrophilic addition. But wait, wait, the starting material here is an ether. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that out in my mind. So the benzene ring has an ether group (-O-) attached to a butenyl chain. The butenyl part is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, wait. Butenyl is four carbons. The structure is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, right? Wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So the 1-yl means the chain is attached at the first carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that's if it's butenyl. Wait, but 3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, wait, no, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me count the positions. For but-3-enyl, the four carbons are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, that's not possible because that would be 1,2-dimethyl or something else. Wait, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the substituents are on carbons 2 and 2, so two methyl groups on the second carbon of the butenyl chain. So the structure is: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. So the chain is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait no, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure should be: OPh-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So more accurately, OPh-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Hmm, not exactly. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as OPh-CH2-CH(CH(CH2CH3))
