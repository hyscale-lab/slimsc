Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about reaction mechanisms and product identification. Hmm, let's see what the question is.

The first part is reacting 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second part is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B. I have to choose the major products from the options given.

Starting with reaction A: the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives. The substituents are at positions 2, 6, and 1. The 2-position has an ethyl group and a methyl, and the 6-position has a methyl. So the structure would have a ketone at position 1, which is the same as the cyclohexanone ring.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate (which is an acrylate ester) and t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this is probably a conjugate addition or some kind of aldol reaction. Wait, aldol reactions usually require enolates. Oh right, when using a ketone and an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like ethyl acrylate), it's a Michael addition. Or is it a Claisen-like addition? Or maybe it's a conjugate addition where the enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Wait, wait. The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So it's a cyclic ketone. With t-BuOK, which is a strong base. I think it would deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. But where would the deprotonation occur?

The ketone is at position 1, so the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. Wait, but the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So the carbonyl is at position 1 (so the numbering is such that the carbonyl is position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 6). So the alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, which would be positions 2 and 6.

But wait, position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl. So the alpha hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6. But the substituents are so bulky at position 2, maybe making deprotonation there difficult. So, maybe the base would abstract a proton from the less substituted position.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can't easily deprotonate position 2 because it's too hindered. So maybe the enolate forms in a different position. Hmm, but wait, the ketone's at position 1. So the possible enolates could form at positions 2 and 6. But position 2 is more substituted, so maybe the base would prefer the less hindered position.

Wait, the base is t-BuOK, which is bulky. So it would abstract the more accessible hydrogen, which might be the less hindered one. So between positions 2 and 6, which is less substituted? Position 6 has only a methyl, while position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl. So position 6 is less substituted. So t-BuOK would deprotonate position 6, leading to the enolate there.

Wait, but wait, the enolate would form at the alpha position, right? So the base abstracts the alpha H, making the enolate. Then, ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The enolate could attack
