Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect about the products formed in a sequence of reactions. Let me try to unpack each step and see what's going on.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that formula is familiar. C3H6 could be either propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane, but I think it's more likely propene because the next reaction involves bromination. Wait, wait, bromination of alkenes is typically a dibromination addition, but wait, if it's in carbon tetrachloride, that's a solvent for a substitution reaction. Oh wait, no, wait. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) when brominated in presence of CCl4 would undergo addition reaction, not substitution. Because substitution usually requires a more polar solvent or a different condition. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For alkenes, bromination can be either addition or substitution. For example, in presence of light, it's substitution (like allylic bromination), but without light, it's typically addition. Wait, but in CCl4 it's a non-polar solvent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a radical bromination. So, propene undergoes bromination via a radical mechanism, leading to allylic bromide. So, the product B would be 1-bromo-1-propene or 3-bromo-1-propene? Wait, the structure of propene is CH2=CH2CH3. When bromine adds via radical substitution, the most stable radical would form. So, the allylic position would be where the bromine adds. So, for propene, the allylic positions are the CH2 and CH3 groups adjacent to the double bond. The most stable radical would form at the more substituted position. So, the first step is substitution, not addition. So, after bromination, B is 3-bromopropane? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The allylic positions are the CH2 and CH3. The radical substitution would add a bromine to one of the CH2 or CH3 groups. Let me think, which position is more stable. The CH2 group is next to the double bond, so when a bromine atom adds, it would form a more stable radical.

Wait, the process is allylic bromination, which leads to 3-bromo-1-propene, but wait
