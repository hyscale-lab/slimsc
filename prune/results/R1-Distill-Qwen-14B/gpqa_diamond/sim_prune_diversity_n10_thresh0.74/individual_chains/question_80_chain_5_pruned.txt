Okay, so I've got this question where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives an output number. I need to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to the new input.

Looking at the examples provided:

AGG gives 115.
TGCTGA gives 176.

Hmm. Let me think about possible ways to convert a DNA sequence into a number. One thought is that each nucleotide might be assigned a numerical value, and the total is the sum of these values. So let's check that.

DNA nucleotides are A, T, C, G. Let's assign each a number. Maybe A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me see.

First example: AGG.

Breaking it down:
A is 1, G is 4, another G is 4. Sum would be 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger. So that's not it. Maybe I need to multiply instead of add?

Wait, another approach: perhaps each nucleotide's value is multiplied by a position factor. Like, each position contributes something based on its position in the string.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is converted to a number and then the whole string is treated as a number in base 4 or another base. Let me think.

Another idea: each nucleotide is mapped to a number, and the entire string is considered as a number in base 10, perhaps. Wait, but the first example is three letters, which would be 1, 4, 4. If treated as digits, that's 1,4,4, which would be 144, not 115. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe it's the sum of each nucleotide's value multiplied by their position. For example, for AGG:

A is position 1: 1*1 =1
G is position 2:4*2=8
G is position3:4*3=12
Sum is 1+8+12=21. Not 115. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the individual letters are converted to their numerical values and then the entire string is treated as a base-5 number. Let's see, but base 5 numbers go from 0 to 4, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another angle: maybe each nucleotide is converted to a letter, then each letter is mapped to a different number. Like A=10, G=20, etc. No, that might not add up.

Wait, let's think about the actual values of the outputs. 115 and 176. Let me see if these numbers can be broken down based on the input lengths.

AGG is 3 letters, output 115. 115 divided by 3 is about 38.3. TGCTGA is 6 letters, output 176. 176/6 is about 29.33. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a number, and then the entire sequence is treated as a number in a certain base. For example, if each nucleotide is A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3, then the sequence would be a base-4 number. Let's test this.

First example: AG
