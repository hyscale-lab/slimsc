Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. The operators for observables P and Q are given as square matrices. I'm supposed to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring Q just after P.

Hmm, right. So the process here is: measure P first, and get a result of 0, then measure Q and get -1. But wait, the system's state is given, but after the first measurement, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, right? Then the second measurement is done on that new state.

Wait, wait. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the joint probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. So I think that the correct approach is to first find the eigenstates of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then see what the state collapses to after measuring P=0, and then compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 in that state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities step by step. Because quantum measurements are sequential, so the state changes after each measurement.

So first, the initial state is the vector (-1, 2, 1)^T, right? Let me write that as a column vector: |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1].

Wait, I should probably normalize it. But wait, sometimes in these questions, they might just give the state without worrying about normalization, and the probabilities adjust accordingly. So perhaps I should compute the norm first.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * [-1; 2; 1]. Wait, but maybe in the problem, they didn't normalize it. Hmm, but I think when you have a state vector, it's usually assumed to be normalized unless stated otherwise. So perhaps I should check that. If the vector is (-1, 2, 1), norm is sqrt(6), so the actual state is 1/sqrt(6) times
