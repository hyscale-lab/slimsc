Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable P and getting the value 0.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Right, so that's a vector in 3D space. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and they can be normalized. But wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The normalization is important because probabilities depend on it.

So, to normalize, I need to calculate the inner product of the state with itself. The state is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The inner product would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm squared is 6. That means the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized because the total probability must be 1. So maybe the actual state is this vector divided by the square root of 6. But I'm not sure if the problem accounts for that. The problem statement just gives the state, so perhaps I'll proceed under the assumption that the state is already normalized, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require normalization because the observable might be expressed in a certain way. Hmm.

Wait, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write down the matrix P to see what it looks like. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. Third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but observables in quantum mechanics are represented by Hermitian matrices. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, each element P_ij must equal the complex conjugate of P_ji. Looking at P, all the elements are real, so P_ij = P_ji. Let's see: for example, P_12 is 1/sqrt(2), and P_21 is also 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, P_23 is 1/sqrt(2), and P_32 is 1/sqrt(2). P_13 is
