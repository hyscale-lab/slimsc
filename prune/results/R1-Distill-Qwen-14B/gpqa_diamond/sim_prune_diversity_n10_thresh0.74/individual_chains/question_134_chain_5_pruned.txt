Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, the exact details are a bit fuzzy in my mind. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are mixed. Oh wait, but wait, mixing them—so all three are being combined. I need to figure out how they will react with each other.

First, I should probably determine how much of each acid is present and how much base is present. Because the neutralization reactions involve acid and base reacting in a certain molar ratio. I think the enthalpy of neutralization is typically given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, while Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, they should undergo neutralization reactions.

So, let's find the moles of each substance. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2
