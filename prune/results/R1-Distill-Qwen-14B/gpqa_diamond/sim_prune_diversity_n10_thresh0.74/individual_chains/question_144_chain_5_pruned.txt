Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm. I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, like bosons, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So, it's a very small distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance shouldn't be too big.

Wait, how do I find the decay distance? I think the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Decay length L is approximately the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L ≈ v * τ.

But wait, I need to find τ first. The lifetime is related to the width Γ via the uncertainty principle. I remember that Γ is the total decay width, and it's connected to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, right, because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ, meaning τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but let me think about the units. Γ is given in MeV. I need to convert that to energy in consistent units, probably in eV. Also, ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Let me recall the value: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait no, more accurately, in units where ħc is about 197 MeV·fm or something. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, I remember that the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But let me make sure of the units. So Γ is given in MeV. Let me convert that to GeV because ħ is usually in GeV·s units. So Γ_X is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0
