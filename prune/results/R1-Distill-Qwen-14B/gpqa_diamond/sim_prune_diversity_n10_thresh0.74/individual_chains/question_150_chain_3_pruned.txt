Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, the problem states that a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO is reacting with a series of reagents. The NMR data is provided, so I'll need to analyze that to identify the structure of the starting compound. Then, I'll track what happens when it reacts with each reagent to find the final product.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, and assuming no halogens (since it's not mentioned), so:

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= 9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Oh, wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So the compound has 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus a double bond and a ring, or a benzene ring plus a double bond and a carbonyl group. Or maybe a benzene and two double bonds, but that's less likely. Alternatively, a benzene ring and a ketone group (which is a double bond, so that's 4 DoU), but wait, the molecular formula includes an O, so maybe a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Hmm, so maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but then a triplet would require coupling with two neighboring protons. So for example, RCH2CHO, the aldehyde (CHO) would be next to CH2, which would have two Hs. So the aldehyde proton would couple with the two Hs on the CH2, giving a triplet. But wait, the CH2 would be adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enal.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably para-substituted aromatic protons. Because in para substitution, the two Hs are equivalent and each couples with one neighboring H (but in para, the coupling is between adjacent Hs, which might
