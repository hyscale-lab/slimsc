Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question says a chemist found a white solid, and we have to pick between four options. Let's look at the data given.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and it's 100%, which probably means that's the molecular weight. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, what could that be? Sometimes, the molecular ion can be accompanied by fragments, but 158 is two units higher than 156. Oh wait, maybe that's a chlorine isotope? Because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35, but the isotopes are 35Cl (~75%) and 37Cl (~25%). So if the molecular ion is 156, adding 2 would give 158. So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl atom. Wait, but the molecular weight would be 156, so the formula would have Cl as part of it.

Next, the IR data. Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But the range is quite broad, but the presence of a broad peak could mean an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe an amide or something else. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is in the range for a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or aldehyde or ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, for a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, maybe a bit lower. An ester is about 1740, but could vary. Aldehydes are around 1720. Wait, but if the IR shows a broad peak, perhaps from an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid because they have strong O-H stretches which are broad.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The peaks are:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H): That's a very high chemical shift. Typically, aldehydic protons are around 9-10 ppm, but this is higher. Or maybe it's an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, usually as a singlet. Oh wait, but if it's a phenolic OH, those are typically broader and sometimes around 5 ppm, but in some cases, if it's de-shielded, maybe higher. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde proton, but 11 ppm seems a bit high for that. Or perhaps it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is 1H, so a single proton, which matches either an aldehyde or a phenol OH, but phenols usually have more than one proton, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm.

Then we have 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into a doublet each. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Let me look at the options now.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with hydroxy and Cl in the 3 and 2 positions. Wait, numbering would be, benzaldehyde is position 1, so 2-hydroxy and 3-chloro. So the structure is o-hydroxy and m-chloro. So that would give in the NMR, the aldehyde proton around 10, but in this case, the NMR has a peak at 11.0 ppm. Also, the aromatic protons would be different. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the benzene ring would have substituents in positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So that would make the ring have two sets of protons in the ortho and para positions to substituents, but I'm not sure if that would give a doublet each. Alternatively, maybe in such a structure, the ring protons would split into more complex patterns, perhaps not just two doublets.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. So the ring would have a COOH group in position 1 and Cl in position 4. The NMR would show the COOH proton at around 11 ppm, as a singlet. The aromatic protons would be two doublets: the ones ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) as one doublet, and para to Cl (positions 3 and 5) as another. That matches the NMR data. Also, the IR would show a broad peak due to the carboxylic acid -OH, and the strong peak at 1720 would be the carbonyl of the COOH group. The mass would then be molecular weight of benzoic acid plus Cl. Let's calculate: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 7*(12) +5*(1) +35.5 +16*2 = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which is 156 m/z. Hmm, that's close, but 156.5 would have the molecular ion at 156.5? Maybe the exact mass isn't matching, but considering the possible isotopes, perhaps the molecular ion is 156, and the 158 is the Cl isotope. Alternatively, wait, benzoic acid with Cl would have a molecular weight of (12*7)+(1*5)+(35.5)+(16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 156 (the main peak) and 158 (due to Cl-37, 35Cl is 75%, 37Cl is 25%, so the M+2 peak would be 32% which matches the data (32% at m/z 158). That seems to fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester) around 1720 cm^-1, but I'm not sure about the other groups. The NMR would have a singlet for the ester oxygen's adjacent protons? Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph, or perhaps Cl-CO-O-Ph. The protons on the benzene would be similar to para substitution. But then, would there be any exchange peaks? The NMR has a peak at 11 ppm, which would be a singlet. For phenyl chloroformate, perhaps the O-H from the carbamate? Wait, no, in chloroformate, the oxygen is probably not acidic. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, but I'm not sure. The 11 ppm peak might not fit. Also, the IR would have the carbonyl, but no broad O-H peak. Unless there's another functional group. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So maybe the O in the carbonyl is connected to O and Cl. So perhaps no O-H in this structure. Then why is there a broad peak in IR from 3500-2700? Maybe it's an aromatic C-H stretch, but that's usually in the 3000-3100 range. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H from another group, but I don't think so
