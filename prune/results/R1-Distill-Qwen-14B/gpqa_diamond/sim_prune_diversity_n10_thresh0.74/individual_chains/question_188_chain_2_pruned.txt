Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all their angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter, a, right? So a is 10 here.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the reciprocal of the square root of (h² + k² + l²) multiplied by some constants involving the lattice parameters. But wait, the formula might be different for non-cubic systems. Oh right, because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is not cubic, so we have to account for the angles between the lattice vectors.

I remember that in a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, wait. I think that's for a hexagonal system or something else. Or was it for the interplanar distance formula in terms of the lattice vectors and angles? Maybe I should think about the general formula for Bragg planes in rhombohedral systems.

Alternatively, I recall that for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar spacing can be found using a formula that involves the unit cell parameter a and the angles. So let me think, the general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But wait, in this case, all the angles are the same, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. So cos α is cos 30°, which is sqrt(3)/
