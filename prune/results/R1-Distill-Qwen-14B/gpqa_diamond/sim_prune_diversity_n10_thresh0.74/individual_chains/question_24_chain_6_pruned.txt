Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I really need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

Alright, the problem starts with a mixture X that's equimolar of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means that there are double or triple bonds present because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So mixture X has some unsaturated compounds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, a disproportionation occurs, leading to mixture Y. This Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever happened during the reaction must have removed the double bonds. But since it's a disproportionation reaction, that suggests that one component is being both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Disproportionation is when a single species undergoes both oxidation and reduction. But in this case, it's a mixture of two liquids reacting to form two other liquids. Oh, so maybe each of the two components in X undergoes some kind of reaction, perhaps each undergoing a disproportionation.

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with platinum under severe conditions, they produce only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon, and its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. So hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. Because 14.28 is about 14.2857, which is 1/7 of 100. So, the percentage composition of hydrogen is 14.28%, which would correspond to a molar ratio. Let's think: the mass of hydrogen in Z is 14.28% of the total mass. So the formula of Z can be found from that.

Hydrocarbons have the formula CnHm. Let's assume it's an alkane because it's a hydrocarbon and it's not reacting further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. So it's probably something like CnH2n+2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate molar ratio. So, for a hydrocarbon, the percentage of H would be (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28%. Let me see, let's solve for m and n.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to think in terms of specific compounds. Let's think about possible hydrocarbons where H is around 14.28% by mass.

Take ethane, C2H6. The molecular weight is 30 (12*2 +6=30). H is 6/30=20%—that's higher than 14.28%. Next, propane, C3H8. Molecular weight is 50. H is 8/50=16%—closer, but still higher. Butane, C4H10: (10)/(58)=approx 17.24%. Hmm, no. Pentane: C5H12. 12/(72)=16.
