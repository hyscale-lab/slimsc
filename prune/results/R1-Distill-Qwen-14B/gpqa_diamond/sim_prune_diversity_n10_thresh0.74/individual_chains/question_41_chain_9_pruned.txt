Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read it again. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, the speed of light in glass is usually given by c divided by n, right? So in the glass, it's c/n. But wait, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 1 here. So normally, it's 1/n. But that's in the glass's rest frame, I think. Because the glass is moving, we might need to apply some sort of velocity addition, like in special relativity.

Oh wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is going through the glass, which itself is moving towards the observer. Hmm.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)) or something like that. Wait, but in this case, u is the speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the glass is moving, so the observer in the lab would see the light moving relative to the glass.

Wait, maybe I should consider the frame of the glass. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but light's speed is always c in any inertial frame, right? No, wait, that's only in a vacuum. Oh wait, no, that's a common misconception. The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium. But according to special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c. But when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium is not necessarily the same as in the lab frame.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to approach this step by step.

So, the speed of light in the glass when the glass is stationary is v_light = c/n = 1/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame.
