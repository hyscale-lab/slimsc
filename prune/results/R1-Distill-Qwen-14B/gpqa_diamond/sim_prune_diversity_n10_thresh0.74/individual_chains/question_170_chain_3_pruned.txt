Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives the spin state as (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means the state is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So the state vector χ is [3i; 4]. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors since an electron is spin-1/2.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh wait, S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. But wait, isn't the Pauli matrix σ_y related to the spin operator? Oh right, the spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

What's σ_y? Oh, the question provided it. It's the matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. Let me write that down:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now, the expectation value calculation involves the state vector. The state is given as (3i,4) which is a column vector, but in Dirac notation, χ is a column vector, and ⟨χ| is the conjugate transpose. So first, I need to compute χ†, which is [3i*, 4*] but as a row vector. Wait, 3i is 3i, so its complex conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no: wait, the state is [3i;4], so χ† is [3i*, 4*]. 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real so 4*. So yes, χ† is [-3i, 4].

The expectation value is χ† S_y χ. So let's compute S_y χ first, then multiply by χ†.

So let's compute S_y times χ. Let me write S_y as (ħ/2) times the
