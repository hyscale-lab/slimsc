Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and we need to figure out the structure first. Then, we're supposed to determine the product after reacting it with a series of reagents: NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The options are four different compounds, all aldehydes with some diphenyl groups.

Wait, let's break this down. First, the NMR. The 1H NMR peaks are at 9.72 (a triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). 

I know that the triplet around 9.7 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as triplets if they're next to a CH2 group or something that splits the signal. So the 9.72 ppm peak is likely the aldehyde proton.

Next, the doublets at 6.98 and 6.51. Those are probably from aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a doublet, so maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with two protons. Similarly, 6.51 is another doublet, perhaps another aromatic group. Wait, but if it's a doublet, maybe they're adjacent in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps each is a set of two protons in a coupling situation.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe an -OH group or some exchangeable proton. But since it's 2H, maybe it's part of a di-substituted aromatic ring with two protons in a certain environment. Or perhaps it's a vinyl or another type of proton. Hmm, maybe those are the protons adjacent to the aldehyde?

Wait, considering the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (X is 0). So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? That can't be right, so I must have messed up the formula. Wait, another way: Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For C8H9NO, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 → (18 -9 +1)/2 → 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. Which can be 5 rings, but more likely a combination of rings and double bonds. For example, benzene (3 rings, but benzene is 3 double bonds, so one ring with 3 double bonds counts as 4 degrees?), wait no. Wait, each ring or double bond is a degree. So a benzene ring is 3 double bonds but it's considered as 3 degrees. No, wait, a benzene ring is 3 double bonds, so that's 3 degrees. So 5 degrees could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring (1), but wait, no. Alternatively, maybe two benzene rings would use 3 + 3 =6, but that's more than 5. So perhaps one benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and then a carbonyl (1), but that sums to 5. Oh, right. So perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde), and a double bond.

Wait, the aldehyde is the 9.72 peak. So maybe the molecule has a benzene ring (3 degrees), an aldehyde (1 degree, since it's a double bond), and another double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps another ring or a double bond.

Looking at the NMR again. The 3.66 ppm doublet (2H) could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like CH2O. Maybe an ethereal oxygen or an aldehyde's adjacent group. Wait, the aldehyde is a CHO group, so maybe the CH2 is next to that. So perhaps a structure like CH2-CHO, which would explain the triplet for the aldehyde and a CH2 as a doublet. Wait, but the aldehyde proton would typically be a triplet if it's next to a CH2 group. Oh, right. So if the structure is R-CH2-CHO, the aldehyde proton would couple with the CH2, giving a triplet, and the CH2 would be next to the aldehyde, so their signals would split each other. So the CH2 would be a quartet if next to a CH2-CHO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to an oxygen, like a CH2-O-R group.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to figure out the structure.

The NMR has peaks at 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). These could be two sets of aromatic protons, possibly on two different benzene rings. For example, a para-substituted benzene could give a doublet. So maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached to some chain.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a bit tricky. Broad singlet could indicate protons that are either in a conjugated system or perhaps attached to an oxygen, like hydroxyl groups. But since it's 2H, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group.

Wait, but the molecular formula doesn't have a hydroxyl group,
