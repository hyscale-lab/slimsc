Okay, so I've got this IUPAC nomenclature problem about a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

So, the molecule has a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. All three are meta to each other. Wait, meta means they're each separated by one carbon, right? So if one is position 1, the next would be 3, and the third would be 5, but wait, wait, maybe I should draw this out.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if I number the positions clockwise, starting from the carboxylic acid as position 1, then the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, no, because in a six-membered ring, each substituent at position 1 has adjacent positions (2 and 6) as ortho, 3 and 5 as meta, and 4 as para. So for three substituents being meta to each other, they must each be separated by two positions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says all three are meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the others. So for example, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B would be at position 3, and substituent C at position 5. That way, each is meta to the others. Because in a benzene ring, position 1 is meta to 3 and 5, but wait, no. Wait, position 1 and 3 are actually meta to each other, but position 3 and 5 are also meta. Hmm, that might work. So if three substituents are in positions 1, 3, and 5, each is meta to the others.

Wait, but in the problem, the substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. So which is which in terms of numbering?

But let me read the rest of the problem. There's a carboxylic acid, and ortho to it are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, wait, ortho to the carboxylic acid would be positions 2 and 6. Because the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are ortho.
