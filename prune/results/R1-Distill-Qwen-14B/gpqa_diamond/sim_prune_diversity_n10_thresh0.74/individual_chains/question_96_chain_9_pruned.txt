Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which relates to their area. Oh right, the formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), or something like that. Wait, let me think. Oh yeah, I think it's S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but maybe the factors are a bit fuzzy. But more importantly, the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

So the problem gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. The distance is d = 1e10 parsecs, and θ is 1e-17 degrees. I need to find the entropy's order of magnitude. Okay, let me plan this out.

First, I should find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ relates to the actual size (like the radius R) via the formula θ (in radians) ≈ R/d. But wait, θ needs to be in radians for that. So I'll have to convert degrees to radians.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = (1e-17 degrees) * (pi radians / 180 degrees). Let me calculate that: 1e-17 * pi / 180. Pi is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Then R ≈ θ_rad * d. Wait, but d is 1e10 parsecs. Oh wait, I need to convert parsecs into meters because the standard units for physics are meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.

What's a parsec in meters? I recall that 1 parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R ≈ θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m. Let me compute that: 1.745e-19 * 3.0857e26 ≈ 1.745 * 3.0857e7. Let me calculate 1.745 *3.0857: roughly 5.38. So R ≈5.38e7 meters. Wait, 1e7 meters is 10 million meters, which is 10,000 kilometers. Hmm, that seems big, but for a supermassive black hole, maybe.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². Oh, wait, no, R_s is 2 G M / c². So if I can find R_s, then I can find the mass M. But wait, in the problem, we're given the angular size of the event horizon, which would be the angular size of the Schwarzschild radius, right? Because the event horizon is at R_s.

So the R we calculated is R_s. So R_s = 2 G M / c².

Wait, so R = R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = (R c²) / (2 G). So once I have R, I can find M.

Then, once I have M, I can find the area A of the event horizon, which is 4 π R².

But wait, I don't need M directly for the entropy, because entropy S is proportional to A, which is 4π R². So maybe I can calculate A from R, and
