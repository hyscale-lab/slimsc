Okay, so I need to figure out this physics problem. Let's see. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that light's speed in different media depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the index, n. So if the medium is stationary, the speed is c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. And the observer is in the laboratory. So I think this has to do with relative motion and how the speed of light is perceived in different frames. Wait, isn't the speed of light in a vacuum always c according to special relativity? But this isn't in a vacuum; it's in moving glass. Hmm, but glass is a medium, so maybe the index of refraction comes into play.

Let me think about the situation. The glass is moving towards the observer. The light beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, how does this affect the speed of light in the glass?

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So in the lab frame, what is the speed of the light beam? The glass is moving, so maybe I should consider the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but when a medium is moving, does the speed of light in that medium change? Or is it that the medium's motion affects the observation of the light's speed differently?

If the glass is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab frame might
