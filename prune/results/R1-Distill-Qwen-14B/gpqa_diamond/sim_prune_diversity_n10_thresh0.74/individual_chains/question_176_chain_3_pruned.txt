Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, no—the state is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually unit vectors. Let me check the state's normalization. The components are -1, 2, 1. The square of the magnitudes would be 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh right, so the state isn't normalized yet. So maybe I should normalize it first?

Wait, in the problem statement, it's given as the state, so perhaps it's already normalized? Or maybe I'm supposed to normalize it before proceeding. Let's see: the state vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So perhaps the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1; 2; 1].

But I'll proceed carefully. Let's note that down.

The operators for P and Q are given. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, so P matrix:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And the matrix for Q:

Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

So, Q is a diagonal matrix. That simplifies things because its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues of Q are known.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q. Wait, no, the question says measuring Q just after P. So the sequence is P first, then
