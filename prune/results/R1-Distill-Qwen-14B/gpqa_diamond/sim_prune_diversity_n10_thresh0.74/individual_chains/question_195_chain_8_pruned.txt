Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's break it down. The question is about the maximum orbital period of a second planet in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Hmm, I remember that transits and occultations depend on the orbital periods and alignment of the planets.

First, the setup: there's a primary planet with Earth's radius, orbiting a star 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days, and the transit impact parameter is 0.2. Then there's a second planet with 2.5 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Wait, what's an impact parameter? Oh right, it's the distance (in units of the star's radius) between the center of the star and the center of the planet's path when it transits. So a lower impact parameter means the planet passes closer to the star's center during transit.

For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star from our point of view. For an occultation, the planet must pass behind the star from our view. So, both events require that the two planets are aligned in such a way that their orbits allow these events.

But wait, I think the key here is that for both events to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the two planets can periodically align to allow for transits and occultations. So, the second planet's orbital period must be a multiple of the first planet's period, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. Let's think about the orbital periods. When two planets are in the same system, their orbital periods determine how often they align. For both transit and occultation events to occur, the second planet's orbital period must be such that when it's behind the star (occultation), the first planet is in a position to transit, and vice versa. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. The question is asking for the maximum period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation occur. That probably means that the second planet must orbit within the same orbital plane and pass in front of and behind the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, but occultation happens when the planet is behind the star. So for that to happen, the planet must have an orbital period that allows it to sometimes be on the far side of the star relative to us
