Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are all various substituted benzoic acids or benzene derivatives. I need to first figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data, then determine what reaction occurs when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me start by looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong absorption bands. The peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1 suggest the presence of either an alkyne or possibly an -OH group. Wait, but 3400-2500 is a broad region. For example, O-H stretches (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) are usually around 3200-3600. But also, C-H stretches in alkenes and alkynes are in that region. 

Another peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak. That usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the ranges for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols are usually around 1-5 ppm, but carboxylic acid protons are around 10-12. So maybe a COOH group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is typical of aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, the protons would split into doublets.

Wait, 8.0 ppm would be more deshielded. If the ring has electron-withdrawing groups, like a ketone or a nitro group, the protons would be more downfield. Alternatively, if it's an activating group, maybe an -OCH3 or something, but that's usually more at lower ppm.

Wait, but in this case, the lower field (higher ppm) suggests substitution with an electron-withdrawing group. So maybe the ring has a carbonyl group attached. Let me think about the 1720 cm-1 peak again. If that's a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone or an ester, but given that there's an -OH peak in NMR, maybe it's a carboxylic acid?

Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 would be a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Let me hold that thought.

Next NMR peak: 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Another doublet, same as the 8.0 ppm. So maybe two sets of doublets in the aromatic region. That might suggest a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Wait, but two doublets would mean that the ring is disubstituted in the para positions. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the two adjacent protons (ortho) would be equivalent and split into a doublet each.

Wait, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the ortho protons (relative to substituent) would be two doublets. Wait, no, wait. Let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. For example, a substituent at position 1 and 3? No, wait, maybe substituents at positions 1 and 4? Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-dimethyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the ring is para-substituted with a group that causes the two ortho protons (on each substituent) to be in different environments.

Wait, perhaps the ring is substituted with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an ethyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group, which would cause the adjacent (ortho) protons to be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm, and the para protons would be less deshielded.

Looking back, the NMR has two doublets: one at 8.0, one at 7.2. So that suggests that there are two sets of two equivalent protons each. Let's think about a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituent is at position 4 (para), and another substituent perhaps elsewhere? Wait, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and the other substituent is at position 1, but that may not make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group at position 4, so the ring has a carbonyl (like a benzophenone structure). In that case, the protons ortho to the carbonyl would be more deshielded. Let's consider that.

In the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) might be the two protons ortho to the carbonyl group, each as a doublet. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons meta to the carbonyl, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, the ring would have two substituents. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a single position, making the ring para-substituted, and the two protons on each adjacent position are equivalent.

Wait, maybe the substituent is at position 4. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the ring has a substituent at position 4, and another group attached elsewhere. But perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, so the ring is para-substituted with a ketone or something else.

Wait, but also looking at the other NMR peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These suggest some sort of alkyl chain, perhaps with a branch.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to something. Wait, a doublet for 3H? That would usually be a methyl group attached to a CH, as in a gem-dimethyl or a CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no, because a CH3 attached to a CH would split into a triplet if adjacent to another CH2, but in this case it's a doublet. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is next to another CH2 group. Let me think about a structure where a CH is next to a CH2. For instance, if you have a CH(CH3)CH2... something.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH adjacent to another CH, perhaps in a cyclopropane (but that's less likely), or perhaps in an isopropyl group. Wait, but 2.9 ppm is a bit high for a CH in an isopropyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a tertiary CH adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH, perhaps part of an ethyl group attached to the ring.

Putting this together, maybe the substituent on the benzene ring is a ketone (CO) group, since the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. So the ring has a ketone substituent.

Wait, but the IR also has a peak around 3400-2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. Could this be an alkyne? Or maybe an -OH from a carboxylic acid. Wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid, the COOH group would have an O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, but the 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl. But then why is there a 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR? That's a very downfield proton, which fits a carboxylic acid -OH. But the IR peak at 1720 would be a bit high for a carboxylic acid (they're usually around 1700). Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but then the O-H would be absent.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, so it's likely an -OH. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group attached to the benzene ring. So the ring has a COOH group, and perhaps some substituent with an ethyl chain.

Let me think about the structure. The benzene ring has substituents at para positions. One substituent is COOH, and the other is an ethyl group, perhaps. But wait, the NMR data: the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which might suggest a di-substituted benzene, but in para positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions. Wait, no, if it's para, then the substituents are opposite each other, so the ortho and para positions on either side would have equivalent protons.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. So perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, causing the two ortho protons (on each substituent) to be deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.0 ppm, and the two meta protons (relative to substituent) might appear at a lower ppm, say 7.2 as a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, like a di-substituted ring, the protons would be in two sets of two each. If substituents are in positions 1 and 3, for instance, the protons would have different environments. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone. For example, if it's acetophenone (phenyl ketone), the ring would have a -COCH3 group. In that case, the ketone's carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, and the ring would have ortho and para protons relative to the substituent.

In acetophenone, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets: the ortho protons (next to the substituent) are more deshielded and appear around 7.8 ppm, and the para protons (opposite the substituent) appear around 7.5 ppm. But in our NMR, the higher ppm is 8.0 and the lower is 7.2. So maybe the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group causing more deshielding.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitro group. But then the IR would show the nitro's stretching, which is around 1520 and 1350 cm-1, but our IR has 1610 and 1450, which could correspond to aromatic C=C. But the 1720 would still be the carbonyl.

Wait, if there's a COOH group, that would explain the 1720 (as it's about 1700 for COOH) and the 10.5 ppm -OH. So perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid with substituents.

The NMR has two doublets in the aromatic region. So the substituent would be in a position that splits the ring into two sets of protons. For example, if the benzoic acid is attached in the para position to another substituent, which is an ethyl group, or something similar.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 (para), and an isopropyl group at position 1. But wait, how would that affect the NMR?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to the ring, and the COOH is at a different position. Alternatively, the substituent is a branched alkyl group attached to the ring, along with the COOH.

Looking at the other NMR peaks, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t,3H) suggest an ethyl group or some sort of branching. Let me think about the integration. The 0.9 triplet is likely a terminal methyl (CH2CH2CH3), but wait, the triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which in turn is attached to another group. So perhaps an ethyl group like CH2CH3, but maybe as part of a longer chain.

The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So something like CH(CH3)CH2... What's attached to the CH2? Let's think.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a group like CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Let's imagine the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that's a chain: maybe a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzyl group attached to a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that would be an aryl ketone. Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)-something.

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 next to a CH (the 2.9 ppm), which is next to a CH3 (the 1.4 ppm). So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH(CH3)2 attached to the ring. But wait, how would that connect?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let me consider: the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to another CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me visualize:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, meaning the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring? Wait, no, that's more like a neopentyl group. Alternatively, a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to another CH2. So the chain would be something like benzene-CH2-C(H)(CH3)2. Wait, but then the NMR would have peaks that fit.

Wait, let me try to think of the substituent as a propyl chain with a branch. The substituent could be a CH2CH(CH3)2 group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that doesn't explain the 1.4 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but that might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, that would make a neopentyl group: CH2-C(CH3)2.

How would that fit into the NMR data?

Let me try to sketch this substituent:

The substituent on the benzene is -CH2-C(CH3)2.

So the chain is benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group (connected to the ring) would be the 2.9 ppm (m,1H), but wait, that's just one proton. Wait, the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2. So the CH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating for 1H. Hmm, maybe the CH2 is split into a multiplet, but perhaps in this case, it's a triplet or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- something. Alternatively, maybe it's a isopropyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, let me think about a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's getting complicated.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a terminal CH3. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is two protons adjacent to the CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the CH3 attached to the CH. So the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or perhaps a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, if the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Then, the CH2 would have two protons. The NMR would show:

- The CH2 group adjacent to the ring would have two protons. But in the data, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a single proton. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to a CH2. Let me think: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. That would make a longer chain.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is CH(CH3), and that CH is connected to another CH2 group. So benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something? Or benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's a primary group. Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, a butyl group can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. The substituent in question is a secondary butyl group, which would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think: the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring. So benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (benzene) would have two protons. But in the data, the 2.9 ppm is 1H, so perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Then, the CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have a proton (the 2.9 ppm), and the adjacent CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But then, where do the 1.7 ppm (2H) and 1.4 ppm (3H) fit in?

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. So benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 would have two protons, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (1H), which might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, but that would have all nine protons as a singlet, which doesn't match the data.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)2 group. So, benzene-CH(CH2CH3)2. Then, the CH would have a proton (the 2.9 ppm), and the CH2CH3 groups would have their own protons.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be the terminal methyl of the ethyl groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 in the ethyl groups, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) might be a methyl attached to a CH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring. So benzene-CH2-CH2-CH3. But then, the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a quartet at around 1.6 ppm (2H), and a triplet for the middle CH2 (maybe around 2.9 ppm). But the data shows a 1.7 ppm as a multiplet (2H), which could fit, but the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) doesn't fit a simple propyl group.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch. So benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something. But then, the NMR data doesn't quite add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclopropane ring attached to the benzene. But that seems less likely.

Wait, another approach. The 10.5 ppm peak is likely a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a benzoic acid with substituents.

In the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzoic acid. So the substituent is at the para position relative to the COOH group.

So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group at position 1, and a substituent at position 4. The substituent is some alkyl group.

Now, the substituent's NMR data: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

This suggests a substituent with a chain that includes a methyl group, an ethyl group, and perhaps a branching.

Let me think of substituent as something like CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would give a CH2 group attached to the ring, then a CH connected to two CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Let me count the protons:

- The CH2 attached to the ring would have 2H. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is 1H, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH would have 1H (the 2.9 ppm), and the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, with the middle CH2 appearing around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but then where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2- group. Then, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH3)CH2- something. But then the NMR doesn't have a peak at 1.4 ppm.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)- group. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In that case, the CH2 would have 2H, which I don't see in the NMR. The 2.9 ppm is 1H, which would be the CH.

Wait, maybe the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Then, the CH would have 1H (the 2.9 ppm), the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the middle CH2 would appear around 1.7 ppm. But then, what about the 1.4 ppm (d,3H)?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to a branched chain. For example, CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching on the middle carbon. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group (CH2C(CH3)2). Then, the substituent would be benzene-CH2-C(CH3)2. The CH2 would have 2H, but in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group. So, benzene-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Then, the CH would have 1H (at 2.9 ppm), the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the middle CH2 would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm. But the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) doesn't fit here.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the substituent is benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

The CH would have 1H (2.9 ppm), the CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the middle CH2 would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm. So that fits except for the 1.4 ppm.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That would imply a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent has a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2 group attached to the ring. So, benzene-CH(CH3)CH2- something. Then, the CH would have 1H (2.9 ppm), the CH3 would have a triplet (if next to a CH2), but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

But then, the substituent is a iso-butyl group. Wait, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is benzene-CH2CH(CH3)2.

The structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the CH2 (attached to the ring) would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a single proton, so that doesn't fit. Unless the CH2 is split into a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with a branching, such as benzene-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. That would have 1H on the CH (2.9 ppm), the CH2CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, and the middle CH2 would be a quartet around 1.7 ppm. But then, where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible options given and see which structure fits.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the structure is benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring? Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring? No, wait.

Wait, the correct structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, that's a primary butyl. Wait, no. Let me think: a butyl group has four carbons. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, so it's attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain.

Wait, no. Wait, for a sec-butyl group, the attachment is on the second carbon. So it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense because that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would be a neopentyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching on the central carbon, making it a tertiary structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. That would be a tertiary substituent attached to the ring. So, benzene-CH(CH2CH3)2.

In that structure, the CH would have one proton (the 2.9 ppm), the adjacent CH2 groups would have their own protons. The CH2CH3 groups would each have a triplet at 0.9 ppm, but the NMR shows only one triplet, so that might not fit. Also, each CH2 would have a quartet around 1.7 ppm, but the data shows a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H), which could fit. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a mystery.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2 group. So, benzene-CH(CH3)CH2-CH2- something. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Another approach: the overall structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent that is a branched alkyl group. The NMR suggests that the substituent has a CH2CH2CH3 group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet) and a CH with a methyl branch (from 1.4 ppm).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. So, benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In this case, the CH2 would have two protons. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the reaction conditions. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. That's a standard reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is more commonly used for the hydrolysis of esters, but perhaps in this case, it's a different scenario.

Wait, no, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI is used to cleave triple bonds, especially in alkynes. It's called the hydroiodic acid cleavage. When an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes cleavage to form carboxylic acids or ketones, depending on the substitution. For example, a terminal alkyne would form a carboxylic acid and an alkane.

But wait, the given data is for Compound X, which is reacting. So perhaps Compound X has an alkyne group that gets cleaved.

Wait, but looking at the IR data, the 3400-2500 cm-1 region is broad, which could be C-H stretches of an alkyne. So, maybe Compound X has an alkyne group.

So, if Compound X is an aryl alkyne, say, phenylacetylene, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, it would undergo cleavage. For example, phenylacetylene (CH≡C-C6H5) would react with red phosphorus and HI to form benzoic acid and an alkane (like methane, but that's probably a byproduct).

Wait, but if the alkyne is in a different position, say, a propargyl group attached to the ring, the cleavage would lead to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a substituted phenylacetylene, which upon cleavage forms a substituted benzoic acid.

Wait, but the IR of Compound X has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could be a carbonyl, perhaps from an ester or ketone. But if X has an alkyne, maybe the 1720 is from something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1720 is from a ketone, and the alkyne is elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR of X shows a 10.5 ppm -OH, which would be a carboxylic acid. So if X is a benzoic acid, then treating with red phosphorus and HI would not make sense unless X is an ester that gets hydrolyzed.

Wait, maybe X is an ester of a benzoic acid. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus could hydrolyze the ester to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI is used in the Cleve reaction, which cleaves alkynes into carboxylic acids or ketones. For example, a terminal alkyne (RC≡CH) would give RCOOH and CH3I. An internal alkyne (R-C≡C-R') would give RCOOH and R'COOH, assuming both ends are R and R' are alkyl groups.

So, if X contains an alkyne, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, options A and C are benzoic acid derivatives. So perhaps X is a propargyl benzoate or something similar.

Wait, but the IR of X shows a 1720 cm-1, which would be a carbonyl. So, perhaps X is an ester or a ketone.

Another thought: if X is a benzophenone (aromatic ketone), then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure what would happen. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aryl ester, like methyl benzoate. But then, treatment with HI and red phosphorus might not do much, unless it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. For example, methyl benzoate would hydrolyze to benzoic acid under acidic conditions.

But the IR of X shows a 1720 cm-1, which would fit an ester. The 10.5 ppm in NMR would then be from a free -OH, which doesn't fit an ester. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2200 cm-1, which is typical for nitriles.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone. Then, treatment with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't do much. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, considering that the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is specific for cleaving alkynes, I think X must have an alkyne. But then, the NMR doesn't show signals typical for an alkyne proton.

Wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for an -OH. If X is a benzoic acid with an alkyne substituent, then the reaction would cleave the alkyne to form another carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think of X as phenylacetylene with a substituent. For example, X is 4-phenyl-1-pentyne. Upon cleavage, it would form 4-phenylbutanoic acid. But I'm not sure if that fits the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propargyl group attached to the ring. For example, benzene with a propargyl substituent (like CH2-C≡C-CH2-). Then, cleavage would break the triple bond, giving two carboxylic acids. But in this case, the substituent would be a propargyl group.

Wait, but the NMR data of X shows a 10.5 ppm -OH, which suggests that X is a benzoic acid already, which doesn't make sense if it's undergoing alkyne cleavage.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the reaction and the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the reaction product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

Option A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So a phenyl group attached at position 2, along with a propanoic acid.

Option D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative, but the product is an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid.

Option B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Again, an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid group.

So, the reaction is either producing a benzoic acid (options A and C) or an aromatic hydrocarbon (B and D).

If the reaction is cleaving an alkyne, the product would be a carboxylic acid. So options A and C are more likely.

But let me think back. The IR of X shows 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The NMR of X shows an -OH at 10.5 ppm, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So X itself is a benzoic acid with an alkyne substituent.

Wait, but that seems conflicting because a benzoic acid would have a COOH group. Then, the IR would show a peak around 1700 cm-1, which it does (1720 is close). The NMR shows an -OH at 10.5, which fits a COOH group. Then, the alkyne would be part of X's structure.

If X is, say, a propargyl benzoic acid, then upon treatment with red phosphorus and HI, the alkyne would cleave, adding more carbons to the chain.

Wait, for example, X could be 3-pentyne benzoic acid. Then, cleavage would give 4-carboxybenzoic acid? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, X could be a phenyl-substituted alkyne, like phenylacetylene with substituents. Upon cleavage, it would form two carboxylic acids.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

If the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the starting material X would have had a substituent that, upon reaction, becomes a sec-butyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which cleaves alkynes. So, perhaps X was an alkyne that, upon cleavage, forms the substituent in the product.

Wait, maybe X is an aryl alkyne with a chain that, upon cleavage, becomes a sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a substituted propargyl benzoate. Upon cleavage, the triple bond would form a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI is used to cleave alkynes into carboxylic acids. For a terminal alkyne, R-C≡CH + P + HI → RCOOH + CH3I.

So, the alkyne is cleaved, and each end becomes a carboxylic acid and a methyl iodide (if terminal).

If X is a propargyl group attached to the benzene ring, then cleavage would generate a carboxylic acid at the point of cleavage.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propargyl group (CH2-C≡C-CH2-), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a triple bond attached. For example, X is benzene-CH2-C≡C-CH2-.

Upon cleavage, the triple bond would break, and each end would form a carboxylic acid. So, benzene-CH2-COOH and CH2-CH2-COOH. But that doesn't fit any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a substituted phenylacetylene, like phenyl-C≡C-R. Upon cleavage, it would form benzoic acid and RCOOH.

But how would that lead to the product options given?

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzene ring with a side chain that includes an alkyne and a substituent that, upon cleavage, forms a longer chain with a branch.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction adds HI across the triple bond, effectively adding two iodide groups, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with an ester group, like benzyl acetate, and the reaction saponifies the ester to a carboxylic acid. But then, the IR would show a strong ester carbonyl (around 1720), and the NMR would show an -OH at 10.5 ppm. That could make sense.

So, if X is an ester, such as methyl benzoate, then upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus (which is a reducing agent?), perhaps it hydrolyzes to benzoic acid. But in that case, the product would be benzoic acid, which isn't one of the options. Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Hmm, perhaps X is an ester with a substituent that, upon saponification, remains as a substituent. For example, X could be a methyl ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, treatment with HI would hydrolyze it to the acid.

But let me think again. The NMR of X shows aromatic protons, so the substituent is on the ring.

Another angle: the product after reaction is a benzoic acid with a substituent. So, perhaps the reaction is not cleavage but something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl chloride or bromide, and the reaction is nucleophilic substitution, but I don't think that fits with red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard reaction, but that's not likely here.

Another possibility: the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to the IR and NMR of X.

IR of X:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: broad, possibly O-H (carboxylic acid) or alkyne C-H.

- 1720 cm-1: strong, likely a carbonyl, possibly ester or ketone.

- Aromatic C=C at 1610 and 1450 cm-1.

1H NMR of X:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): -OH of carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para to substituent on benzene.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): perhaps meta to substituent.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): likely a CH in a substituent.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): perhaps a CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): likely a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): likely a terminal CH3.

Putting this together, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that is a branched alkyl chain.

So, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, perhaps. But I'm not entirely sure.

Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, which is used for cleaving alkynes, perhaps X has an alkyne in the substituent, which upon cleavage produces a longer chain with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in X is a propargyl group, like CH2-C≡C-CH2- attached to the ring. Then, cleavage would yield a -CH2-COOH group and a -CH2-CH2-COOH group, but that may not fit.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a butynyl group. For example, X is 4-pentyne benzoic acid. Upon cleavage, it would form 4-carboxybenzoic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propargyl ester group. Then, cleavage would form a carboxylic acid.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the product is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

What would X be in that case, before the reaction? If the reaction is cleaving an alkyne to form the sec-butyl group, then X must have a substituent that, upon cleavage, becomes a sec-butyl.

Wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. So, if X's substituent is a propargyl group, perhaps on cleavage, it becomes CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, the propargyl group is CH2-C≡C-CH2-. Cleavage with red phosphorus and HI would break the triple bond, adding OOH groups. For a propargyl group (CH2-C≡C-CH2-), cleavage would produce two carboxylic acids: HOOC-CH2- and HOOC-CH2-.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I should think of X as having a propargyl group attached to the ring. For example, benzene-CH2-C≡C-CH2-.

Upon cleavage, the triple bond would break, and each end would form a carboxylic acid. So, the product would be benzene-CH2-COOH and CH2-CH2-COOH. But that doesn't fit the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a triple bond in the substituent. For example, benzene-CH2-C≡C-CH(CH3)-.

Upon cleavage, it would form benzene-CH2-COOH and CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the product would have a COOH group where the triple bond was, and another COOH group on the adjacent carbon.

But that doesn't directly fit the options.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps X is a substituted phenyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to form the benzoic acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide or chloride is replaced by HI, but I don't see that in the data.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a hydration of an alkyne to a ketone, but that usually uses different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation, but again, not fitting.

Wait, another thought: the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but that uses HCl and Zn(Hg). Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation. But red phosphorus and HI are more for cleavage.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the reaction as cleaving an ester or amide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a elimination reaction, but I'm not certain.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to determine what X is, and then see what the product would be upon reaction.

So, from the NMR and IR data, X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has an ethyl group and a branching.

The substituent's structure is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring. Then, the NMR data would fit.

So, the substituent is CH(CH2CH3). So, the structure is benzene-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, because the COOH is at the para position. So, the structure would be 4-(CH(CH2CH3))benzoic acid. But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, what is the structure of a sec-butyl group? It's CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the ring? No, that's a primary substituent. Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So, the substituent is a butyl group where the point of attachment is the second carbon. So, the substituent is CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, that's a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as CH(CH2CH2CH3). So, the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI... Wait, but X doesn't have an alkyne, so why the reaction? Unless I'm wrong about X's structure.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester with a substituent that, upon hydrolysis, becomes the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a propargyl group and a COOH group. Then, the reaction would cleave the alkyne to form another COOH group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Given the options, and the fact that the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which cleaves alkynes, I'm inclined to think that the product is a benzoic acid with a substituent that arises from the cleavage of an alkyne in X.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, perhaps X was a benzene ring with a propargyl group, which upon cleavage gives a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps X was 4-pentynebenzoic acid. Upon cleavage, it would give 4-carboxybenzoic acid, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(prop-1-yn-2-yl)benzoic acid. The structure would be benzene-COOH with a substituent at position 4 being CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Upon cleavage with red phosphorus and HI, the triple bond would break, adding OOH groups. So, the substituent would become CH2-COOH and CH3-COOH. But that would give two carboxylic acids, which doesn't fit the product options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propargyl group attached to a CH(CH3), so that cleavage would form a branch.

Wait, perhaps X is 4-(1-propynyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is CH2-C≡CH. Upon cleavage, this would form CH2-COOH and CH3-COOH. But again, that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the substituent's NMR data, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH3)CH2 group. If X is a benzene ring with a substituent that is CH(CH3)CH2COOH, then upon reaction, what would happen? I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps should proceed to the conclusion based on the options and reaction.

Since the reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which cleaves alkynes, and the product is a benzoic acid, the correct option is likely C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates O-H stretching (likely from a carboxylic acid) or C-H stretching (possibly from an alkyne).
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong peak suggesting a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets in the aromatic region, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: These peaks indicate a branched alkyl chain. The 0.9 ppm triplet corresponds to a terminal methyl group (CH₃), the 1.7 ppm multiplet corresponds to a CH₂ group, and the 1.4 ppm doublet corresponds to a CH₃ group attached to a CH.

### Structural Deduction:
- The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a **para-substituted benzoic acid** with a branched alkyl substituent at the para position. The substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (CH₂CH(CH₃)₂) based on the NMR peaks.

### Reaction Analysis:
- The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which is known to cleave alkynes. However, since Compound X does not contain an alkyne, the reaction is interpreted as a hydrolysis of an ester or a transformation involving the substituent on the benzene ring.
- The product must be a benzoic acid derivative, as indicated by the reaction conditions and the presence of a carboxylic acid group in Compound X.

### Option Analysis:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure does not match the para-substitution pattern or the sec-butyl substituent.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the reaction conditions.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This matches the para-substitution pattern and the sec-butyl substituent. It is consistent with the reaction conditions and the IR/NMR data.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This is an aromatic compound without a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the reaction conditions.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, as it aligns with the structural features of Compound X and the reaction conditions.

**Answer: C**
