Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. So, compound A has two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can tell us about the structure.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H likely indicates a CH3 group adjacent to another CH2. Because in an NMR, a triplet comes from two neighboring protons. Like, if the CH3 is next to a CH2, each of the CH3 protons would split the CH2 protons into a triplet. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, the splitting depends on the neighboring protons. So, if a CH3 is next to a CH2, the CH3 protons would split into a quartet, because each CH2 has two protons, so n=2, so quartet? Wait no, wait. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is for 6H. So, each of those 6H is equivalent, and they're split into a triplet. So that suggests that these 6H are on two equivalent CH2 groups, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like two CH2CH3 groups adjacent to another group. Or perhaps it's a cyclopropane or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, another possibility: the triplet could be from a -CH2CH3 group next to another CH2 group. Wait, but if each CH3 is next to a CH2, then the CH3 would split into a quartet, but the CH2 would split into a triplet. Because each CH2 has two adjacent protons (from the CH3), so the CH2 protons would be a triplet.

Wait, in compound A, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That makes me think of two equivalent CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3H, and there are two of them, so 6H in total. But why a triplet? Oh wait, those CH3 groups are next
