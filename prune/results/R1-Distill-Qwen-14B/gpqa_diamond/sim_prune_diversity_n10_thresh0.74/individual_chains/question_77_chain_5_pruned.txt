Okay, so I need to figure out the major products A and B from the given reactions. Let me start by looking at each reaction and the options.

The first reaction is with BuLi and H+. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, often used in deprotonation, especially in enolate formation. 

Looking at the structure of the starting molecule: It has a benzene ring attached to a CH2-O- group, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is like Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Or wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl has the structure CH2CH2C(=CH2)CH3? Wait, no. Let me correct that. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but substituted. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C-CH(CH3)-. Or wait, wait. The substituents: but-2-en-1-yl means the double bond starts at C2, so positions 1,2,3,4. So 1 is the first carbon attached. So structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=C-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out.

But-2-en-1-yl: The numbering is from the point of attachment. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with double bond between C2 and C3. So, wait, no, wait, 1-yl is the
