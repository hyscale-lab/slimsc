Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilating into two particles each, A⁺ and A⁻. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess its velocity is much less than the speed of light, meaning maybe we can approximate using non-relativistic methods. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case here.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are given in terms of c, so it's a significant fraction of the speed of light. That suggests that the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so maybe we can't ignore relativistic effects. Hmm, so perhaps I need to use conservation of energy and momentum here.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. The rest mass of a proton (and antiproton) is about 938 MeV/c². So if the antiproton is moving slowly, its total energy is approximately its rest energy. But wait, the initial particles are p and p̄. So their rest masses are each 938 MeV/c², so combined, 1876 MeV. But the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV/c², so four times that is 1200 MeV. Hmm, 1876 is more than 1200, so the total energy is enough, but since the initial particles are moving, but the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial kinetic energy might be small.

Wait, but the initial setup: the antiproton is moving, but slowly. So the proton is probably at rest? Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton is moving much slower than the proton. Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear. It says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. Or maybe the center of mass frame is important here.

Wait, the problem is about annihilation, but perhaps annihilation
