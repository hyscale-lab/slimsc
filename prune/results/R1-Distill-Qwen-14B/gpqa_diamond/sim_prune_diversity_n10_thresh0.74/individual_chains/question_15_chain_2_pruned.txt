Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is used to detect planets when they pass in front of their star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I need to think about the factors that affect the probability of such a transit happening.

The question gives details about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations a bit.

The host stars have different masses but the same radius. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but the stars have the same radii. That's interesting. I think that a star's radius affects the transit probability because a larger star makes a smaller dip, but since their radii are the same, that aspect is equal. But their masses are different. How does the star's mass influence the transit probability?

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting is related to the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of its orbit. The formula I think is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of the orbital distance squared. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s) * (something with the orbital period). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by the semi-major axis, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the transit probability for a planet is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 / (a^2), where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, I think it's more like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a(1 - e^2)^(3/2))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that simplifies. But wait, a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So a is proportional to (P² M)^(1/3). Since Planet_1 has a period P1 = P2 /3, and M1 = 2 M2, let me compute their a's.

Let's denote Planet_2's period as P. So Planet_1's period is P/3.

For Planet_2: a2 = [ (G M2 (P)^2 )/(4π²) ]^(1/3)

For Planet_1: a1 = [ (G (2 M2) (P/3)^2 )/(4π²) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P²/9) ) ]^(1/3) / [ (4π²/G)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute a1/a2.

a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M
