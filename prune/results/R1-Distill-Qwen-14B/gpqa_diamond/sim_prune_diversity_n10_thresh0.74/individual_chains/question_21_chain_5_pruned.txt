Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Hmm, tautomerism, right. That's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in ketones and aldehydes. For example, in carbonyl groups, if there's an adjacent hydrogen, the molecule can tautomerize. But wait, some structures might not allow that.

Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene where two oxygen atoms are attached. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,4-benzoquinone, which has two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. Alternatively, it might be para-quinone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, at positions 1,3,5. So that's a six-membered ring with three keto groups opposite each other.

Tautomerism usually requires at least one alpha hydrogen. Because in tautomerism, the hydrogen moves, so the adjacent carbon must have H's.

In benzoquinone, each keto group is attached to a benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are directly attached to the aromatic ring. Do the carbonyl carbons have alpha hydrogens? Wait, the carbonyl is O=C-, and the adjacent carbon is part of the benzene ring. Benzene is a ring of six carbons, each bonded to another. So the carbonyl in benzoquinone is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring. The adjacent carbons are in the ring, so they don't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. Because in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one H (in the case of hydrogenated benzene, but in the case of quinones, perhaps the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and substituted as well). Wait, maybe I'm confusing this.

Wait, maybe in benzoquinone, each of the carbonyl groups is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring but are they substituted with H? Let's think: benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If a carbonyl is at position 1, then position 2 is a CH group? Or perhaps in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, and the adjacent carbons (2 and 6, 3 and 5) have hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but the carbonyl carbons in benzoquinone are each attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So each carbonyl group is R-C=O, where R is the benzene ring. But the carbonyl carbon is attached to the benzene, so the adjacent carbon (in the ring) would be a CH that's part of the ring. So, for tautomerism, the carbonyl needs an alpha hydrogen, right? In the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part
