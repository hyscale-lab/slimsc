Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, so I need to figure out what that structure looks like and then match it to the NMR options.

First, let's break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, actually, the ring is 6-membered, which makes me think it's a benzene ring. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached to the benzene ring. And the total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents should add 2 more carbons. But wait, each substituent could be one or more carbons.

Let me think about the substituents. The IR has a carbonyl group (C=O), which usually appears around 1700 cm-1. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, which for halogens like Cl, Br, I would show a strong peak around 600 cm-1 or so. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen attached to the ring.

Wait, but wait: the substituents could be where the carbonyl is part of the substituent. So possibilities are, for example, a ketone and a halogen, but maybe more complex groups.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. Since the ring is di-substituted, and we have a carbonyl and a halogen. But wait, the substituents could be combinations like -OCH3 or something else, but the IR specifically says a carbonyl and an aromatic halogen. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait, substituents on the benzene ring can be either activating or deactivating. Halogens are ortho/para directors, but they are deactivating because of their electronegativity. The carbonyl group (like a ketone) is also a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but the problem says di-substituted. So the two
