Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. It mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. We need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much larger than ΔE, much smaller, etc.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the energy shift due to the magnetic interaction. For paramagnetism, the coupling is usually the Zeeman effect. So the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

But wait, paramagnetic coupling... Oh, maybe it's the spin-orbit coupling? Or perhaps it's the perturbation due to the magnetic field. I think for the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is given by something like ΔE_zee = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, m is small here.

Wait, but the problem says small m. Oh, so m could be zero or ±1, maybe. Because m is the orbital quantum number, which for a given l, m can be -l to +l. But if l is small, like for hydrogen, in ground state l=0, but maybe higher states. Wait, but for the ground state, l=0, so m=0. But if we're considering excited states, l could be 1, so m could be -1,0, +1. But since m is small, perhaps the coupling term is small.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is given by the energy difference between two states. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is the Balmer series for hydrogen. That specific wavelength corresponds to
