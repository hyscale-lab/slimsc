Alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Okay, so the question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with compound D. I need to figure out what D is from the given options.

First, let's break down the information step by step. 

Starting with compound A: it has a proton NMR with two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what does that tell me? Well, in NMR, the splitting patterns can indicate neighboring protons. A triplet usually comes from two neighboring protons, so maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Similarly, a quartet (which is a four-peaked signal) suggests three neighboring protons.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's a lot of protons. Ethyl groups often show up around 0.9-1.5 ppm. If there are 6H as a triplet, maybe two ethyl groups? Because each ethyl has 3H, but wait, 3H per CH2CH3, but maybe two of them would give 6H? No, wait, each CH2CH3 has 3H, so two ethyl groups would be 6H. But the triplet would mean each proton is next to two others. Oh, wait, no: splitting depends on neighboring protons. Each CH2 in an ethyl group (like CH2CH3) has neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests perhaps two equivalent CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has 3H as a triplet. Wait, but each CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH2, but maybe the splitting is different. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropyl group? No, because isopropyl gives a septet. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. So, maybe it's a diethyl something. Like diethyl ether? But diethyl ether would have a triplet for the CH2 groups adjacent to O. Wait, for diethyl ether, each CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the CH2 adjacent to O. So the NMR would show a triplet integrating for 4H (each
