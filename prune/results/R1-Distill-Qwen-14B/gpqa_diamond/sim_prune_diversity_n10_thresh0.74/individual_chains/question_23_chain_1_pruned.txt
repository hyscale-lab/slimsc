Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what's going on.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine what the products are from the given options.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the benzene ring is connected via an oxygen (an ether linkage). The other part is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Breaking that down: but-3-en-1-yl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So, structure-wise, it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-... Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but that's not right. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let's see: butane has four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-, but wait, no. Wait, but-3-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2, but maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4 if counting from the end, but wait, but-3-ene would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, because for butene, the possible double bonds are between 1-2 (1-butene) and 2-3 (cis or trans). Oh wait, but but-3-ene isn't possible because butane only has four carbons, so the double bond can't be after the third carbon. Wait, maybe I messed up the structure.

Wait, wait another second. The correct structure of but-3-en-1-
