Okay, so I have this question about analyzing a peptidic compound using NMR and LC-MS. Hmm, let's go through the problem step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Oh, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Also, the LC-MS at elevated temp shows two peaks with equal intensity and same mass. What's going on here?

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that's the case, the NMR would show the expected peaks plus some from the precursor. But the question says all peaks except two are matching, so maybe not. Also, LC-MS would show a peak for the compound and another for the precursor, possibly with different masses. But here both peaks have the same mass, so A might not be right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for optical activity. So in NMR, they should look the same, same shifts, same coupling. But if the sample is a racemic mixture, would that cause duplicate peaks for the same proton? Wait, if the molecule is not chiral, you don't get enantiomers. Or if it's chiral, but the alpha proton's environment is same in both enantiomers. So in NMR, the signals would overlap, not split into two. Also, LC-MS wouldn't separate them because enantiomers have same mass and same retention time unless using chiral columns, but the question says elevated temp, maybe RT not chiral. So B might not be it.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling usually refers to when a proton is coupled to two different sets of equivalent protons. Wait, but the problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not that. Also, if it's a coupling issue, the integrals would add up, but I'm not sure if it's the same as in the question. Not sure about this one yet.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, their peaks would split. If the alpha proton is in different environments in the two diastereomers, maybe you get two separate peaks. Let's think: if the molecule has multiple stereocenters, say two, and during synthesis, some diastereomers formed. In that case, the NMR would show two separate signals for the same proton in different diastereomers. But why similar shifts and equal integrals? Also, the LC-MS would show two peaks because diastereomers have different retention times, but same mass. Wait, but in
