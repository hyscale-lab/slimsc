Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question describes a series of reactions starting with a specific compound, and I need to figure out the final product. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me parse this structure. So it's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached via the middle carbon, right? So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2? No wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait no, actually, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-)–. No, wait, let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–C(=CH2)–? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let's correct that. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Or is it CH2–C(–CH2)–, no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent would be the group attached at the middle carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2–CH2? No, perhaps I should draw it. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2–? No, wait, another approach: the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at position 5 as a propene group, with the substituent being attached to the middle carbon of the double bond. So it's (prop-1-en-2-yl) means the group is CH2–C(=CH2)–? No, wait, I think it's correct to say that the substituent is CH2–CH2–CH2
