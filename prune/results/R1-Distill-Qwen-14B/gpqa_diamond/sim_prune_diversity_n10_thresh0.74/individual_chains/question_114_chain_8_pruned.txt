Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The problem has two reactions:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are about choosing the correct reagents A and B from the given choices.

Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's often related to the formation of cyanohydrins. Wait, yes! The cyanohydrin reaction. So, ketones reacting with CN- (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid helps to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack and form the cyanohydrin.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has both an OH and CN group on the second carbon. So that's a cyanohydrin formation. Therefore, A should be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, the possible A's are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which would make sense. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid, often used in other reactions like the hydroboration or in some oxidations. Wait, no, in the presence of a ketone and CN-, I think H+ is needed, so A should be H3O+.

So looking at the options: options A and B have H3O+ for A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So that might narrow it down to A or B for the first part.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is a nitrile group attached to a more complex molecule (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile). It's reacting with B (H2O) to form the corresponding acid. Wait, n
