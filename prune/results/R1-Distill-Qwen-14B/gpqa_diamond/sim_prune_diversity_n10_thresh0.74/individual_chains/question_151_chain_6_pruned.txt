Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting a value of 0 at a particular time t.

Alright, let's break it down. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should equal 1. Wait, let me check that. Oh right, the state vector is a probability amplitude, so if it's not normalized, I'll have to normalize it before proceeding.

So first, let's compute the norm of the state vector. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is each component divided by sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P looks like this:

Row 0: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 1: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 2: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, I'm a bit confused. In quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, right? So P should be a Hermitian matrix. Let me check if this matrix is Hermitian. A Hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. Here, all the elements are real, so the conjugate doesn't change anything. So the transpose of P is:

Column 0: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Column 1: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Column 2: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, wait, no. The transpose of a matrix switches rows and columns. The original matrix P has:

Row 0: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 1: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 2: [0, 1/√2, 0]

So the transpose would be:

Column 0 becomes row 0: 0, 1/√2, 0 → same as row 0 of the original.

Column 1 becomes row 1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 → same as row 1 of the original.

Column 2 becomes row 2: 0, 1/√2, 0 → same as row 2 of the original.

So the transpose is the same as the original matrix. Therefore, P is symmetric, which makes it Hermitian because all elements are real. Ok, that's good because observables should be Hermitian.

Now, the eigenvalues of P will be the possible measurement outcomes. But the question asks for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. So I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then compute the projection onto the state vector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and other probabilities, but wait, no, I need the probability of getting exactly 0.

So the steps are:

1. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

2. Identify the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

3. For each such eigenvector, compute the inner product with the state vector (after normalization), and square it to get the probability.

Sum these probabilities to get the total probability of measuring 0.

So let's start by finding the eigenvalues of P.

The matrix P is:

[ 0         1/√2      0        ]

[1/√2      0         1/√2     ]

[ 0         1/√2      0        ]

Hmm, let's find its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) =0.

So the characteristic equation is:

| -λ      1/√2       0        |

|1/√2    -λ         1/√2     |

| 0       1/√2      -λ        | = 0

Let me compute this determinant.

Expanding along the first row:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

So,

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ * 1/√2 ) - 0 ] + 0

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ (λ² - 1/2) → -λ³ + (λ/2)

Second term: - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) → - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) → - ( - λ/2 ) → λ/2

So putting together:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ³ + λ =0

Factor:

λ (-λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 -λ²) )=0

So the eigenvalues are λ=0 and λ=1, λ=-1.

Wait wait, wait. Let me recompute the determinant because I might have made a mistake in the expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the determinant properly.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]

+ 0 * [ something ]

So,

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) * [ (-λ / √2 ) ]

So,

-λ³ + (λ/2) 

+ (1/√2)(λ / √2 )
