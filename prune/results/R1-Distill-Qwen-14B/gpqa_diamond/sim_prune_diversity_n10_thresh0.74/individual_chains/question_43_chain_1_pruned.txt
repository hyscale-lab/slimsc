Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC naming. But let's take it step by step.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to one another. Hmm, wait, meta to each otherâ€”so each is separated by two carbons? Or maybe each is meta with respect to the others? Actually, the way it's phrased, they are all meta to one another, meaning each is in a position that's meta to the others. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think: meta to each other would mean each is two positions apart from the others. So if one is at position 1, another would be at 3, and the third at 5? Because in a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other.

Wait, no. Wait, each is meta to the others. So for three substituents, they would each be in positions that are meta to each other. So perhaps their positions are 1,3,5? Because in that case, each substituent is two positions apart from the others. Like, 1 to 3 is two apart, 3 to 5 is two apart, and 5 to 1 (since it's a ring) is also two positions apart. So that makes sense.

But wait, the problem says the car
