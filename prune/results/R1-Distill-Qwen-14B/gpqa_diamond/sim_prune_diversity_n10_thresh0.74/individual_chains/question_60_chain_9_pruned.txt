Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be different from the time measured by someone on Earth.

The question says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c. Wow, that's really close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective. Wait, no, the question is asking how long it will take for their astronaut to reach Earth from the astronaut's point of view. So, the astronaut's own experienced time is what matters here.

But wait, let me make sure I understand the setup. The aliens are from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're traveling to Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But wait, the problem doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume it's a certain distance? Or perhaps the key is to use the speed and calculate the time from their perspective using time dilation.

Wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's experienced time. So, the proper time is the time experienced by the traveler, which is shorter than the coordinate time (the time measured from Earth, perhaps). But how do I calculate that?

The formula for time dilation in special relativity is based on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, the astronaut is moving at v, so from Earth's frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted, so the time would be less.

Alternatively, the astronaut's own time (tau) is related by tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me get back to the problem. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. So, from Earth's perspective, the trip might take a lot of time, but with the spacecraft moving so fast, from the astronaut's perspective,
