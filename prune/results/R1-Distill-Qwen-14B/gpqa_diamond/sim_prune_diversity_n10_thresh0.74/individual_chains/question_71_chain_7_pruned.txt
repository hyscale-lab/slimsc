Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? I remember that this method looks at the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as seen from Earth, which can indicate the presence of other planets in the system. So, the planets are in orbital resonance and have periods in a specific ratio.

The planets are designated Planet_1 to Planet_5, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, that means the periods are P1, 2P1, 2.5P1, 3.5P1, and 5P1. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The ratios are planet 1 to 2 is 1:2, then 2 to 3 is 2:2.5, etc. So each planet's period is as per the ratio given.

The question is asking about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so I don't need to worry about that factor. Equilibrium temperature relates to how much energy a planet absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature Te is proportional to (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4), but I think we can simplify that.

Wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since albedo is the same for both planets, it will cancel out in the ratio. So the main factors are the distance from the star and the star's luminosity.

I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like:

Te = [ ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ) ]^(1/4 )

But since a is the same for both, it cancels when taking the ratio. So the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the ratio of their distances.

Wait, but the orbital periods are given. So how do I relate the period to the distance? I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, or more
