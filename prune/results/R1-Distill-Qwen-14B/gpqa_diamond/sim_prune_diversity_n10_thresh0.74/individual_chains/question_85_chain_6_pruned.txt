Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let me read the question carefully. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. They both have the same albedo, which probably means I don't have to worry about that factor in the temperature calculation.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I need to find T1 / T2, or maybe T2 / T1. Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies. So the formula boils down to T_p = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), but since both have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but I don't have the distance a. Oh, but maybe I can find the ratio of the distances using the RV method data given. Because the RV method tells us about the mass and the velocity, which relates to the distance.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass function, which depends on the planet's mass, the inclination angle, and the distance. But since both planets are detected via RV, and assuming the same star, perhaps I can relate their velocities and masses to find their orbital distances.

Alternatively, since both planets are causing Doppler shifts, perhaps I can find their velocity semi-amplitudes, K, and relate that to their orbital distances. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum Doppler shift observed. For a star, K is given by K = (v * sin i) = (2π G P)^(-1/3) ) * (M_p (sin i)) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/(a (1 - e^2 )^(1/2)) )^(1/3) ), but e is zero here. Hmm, perhaps an easier approach is to use the fact that for circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But I don't know the orbital periods, P. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the velocities to the masses
