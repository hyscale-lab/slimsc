Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about an electron's state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The Aij are given as ħ/2 when i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out what the state |alpha> is. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I need to normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and they need to have a length (norm) of 1.

So let's compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm squared is the inner product of this state with itself. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is zero, and each has an inner product of 1 with themselves.

So the norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Let me compute each modulus squared.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So for 1+i, it's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For 2 - i, it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

But wait, the state is given as proportional, so that's correct. So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about another operator with matrix elements Aij. The problem says Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, else 0. So let me think about the matrix form. Since the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are two states, the matrix is 2x2.

Wait, the operator's matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else zero. So the matrix is:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Because when i=1, j=2, and i=2, j=1, the elements are ħ/2. The diagonals are zero.

Wait
