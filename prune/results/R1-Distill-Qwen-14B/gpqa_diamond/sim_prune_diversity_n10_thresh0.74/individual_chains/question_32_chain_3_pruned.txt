Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let's see what I remember about this.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6 maybe? Because Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6, I think. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to find the energy of this nucleus when moving at v = 0.96c. Right, so relativistic energy. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy.

So the formula would be E = gamma * m0 * c². But I have to calculate gamma first. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, v is 0.96c, so let me compute v squared over c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let me compute 0.96^2: 0.96 * 0.96. 96*96 is 9216, so 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: Let me think. 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, right? Because 28*28 is 784, so yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... which is exactly 25/7, since 25 divided by 7 is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is 25/7. Now, the rest mass energy is m0 c². What's the mass of Li-6? Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.015
