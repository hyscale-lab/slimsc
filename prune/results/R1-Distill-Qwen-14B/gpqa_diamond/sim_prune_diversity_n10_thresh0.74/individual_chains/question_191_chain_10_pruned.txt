Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring, right? On the 3 position, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH), and on the 5 position, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2 group attached to a double bond. Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2 group attached to C2, which is the middle carbon. So the substituent is CH2-C(=CH2)- maybe? Wait, no. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the second carbon. No, wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond from C1 to C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2- but as a substituent on the cyclohexane. So the substituent on C5 is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Maybe I should draw that.

Wait, let's say it's a cyclohexanone ring. Position 1 is the ketone. At position 3, we have a hydroxymethyl (like CH2OH attached). At position 5, we have prop-1-en-2-yl. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH(CH2) where the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl group is (CH2)CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached via the middle carbon. Wait, no. Maybe it's CH2
