Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo. The RV method shows shifts in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, with Planet1 causing 0.03 Å and Planet2 0.04 Å shifts. Wait, but how does that affect the equilibrium temperature?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I think is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 / ( (1 + e) )^0.5 ). But wait, since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So that last part goes away.

So the key factors are the star's temperature, the planet's distance (a), and the square root of (R_star/(2a)). But wait, no, the formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Wait, equilibrium temperature (T_p) is given by the formula:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 * a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4)

Yes, that sounds right. So the ratio of T_p1 to T_p2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo1)/(1 - albedo2) )^(1/4) )

But wait, both have the same albedo, so the (1 - albedo) term cancels out. So the ratio simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because (R_star/(2a1)) divided
