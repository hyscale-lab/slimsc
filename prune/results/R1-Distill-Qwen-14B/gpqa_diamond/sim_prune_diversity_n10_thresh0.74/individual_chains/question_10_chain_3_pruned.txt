Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a) to d), and the choices are A) to D) as the possible answers. I need to figure out which option corresponds to the planet with the highest density.

First, I remember that density is calculated as mass divided by volume. Density = Mass/Volume. So for each planet, I need to find its density and then compare them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known, right? Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So option a has the same mass and radius as Earth. So its density should be 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the density is given directly here. So that's 5.5. Hmm, but is this correct? Because if a planet has more mass, unless its radius also increases proportionally, its density would go up. Wait, but the given density is the same as Earth's. So if the mass is double but density remains same, the volume must be double as well. Because density equals mass/volume. If density is the same, then volume must scale with mass. So for this planet, the volume is twice that of Earth. So its radius would be larger. But the question is, what is its density? The question says it's approximately 5.5, so that's the same as option a. So maybe this planet's density is 5.5, same as a.

Wait, but wait, can a planet with twice Earth's mass and similar density exist? Because the composition would matter. If it's same composition as Earth, then the density would be similar, but if it's a different composition, maybe not. But in this case, the question states the density is about 5.5, so maybe it's same as Earth.

So in that case, options a and b have the same density.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition means same density, right? Because composition affects the average density. So if Earth's density is 5.5, then this planet should have the same density. But wait, let me think
