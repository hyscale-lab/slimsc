Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The problem says that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrix forms of these operators are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is found in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We're asked to find the uncertainty ΔPz of Pz.

Hmm. Uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So, ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

First, I need to calculate ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩. But to do that, I need to know the state vector and apply Pz to it.

Wait, the state is given in the eigenbasis of Pz? Or is it in the eigenbasis of Px? Oh wait, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of Pz, so the state is expressed in the Pz eigenbasis. That makes sense because the matrix forms of Px, Py, Pz are given in this basis.

So the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Since this is the eigenstate of Px, but we're working in the Pz basis, so I don't think we need to change the basis. The state is already in the correct basis.

So, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Wait, Pz is the operator matrix given. Let me write down the matrix for Pz again. Pz's matrix is:

Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

So the matrix Pz is:

[ ħ    0      0    ]
[ 0    0      0    ]
[ 0    0    -ħ ]

So, the operator Pz acts diagonally on the state.

Since the state is in the Pz basis, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is the sum over the components of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements of Pz.

Wait, let's think about it. The expectation value ⟨A⟩ for an operator A in state |ψ⟩ is equal to ψ† A ψ.

Since Pz is diagonal, the matrix multiplication will just pick out the diagonal elements multiplied by the components of ψ. So, for each component i, (ψ_i)² * (Pz_ii), summed over i.

Wait, no. Actually, when you have a diagonal matrix, the product ψ† Pz ψ is the sum of |ψ_i|^2 * Pz_ii.

So, let me compute each term.

The state ψ has components:

ψ₁ = -1/2,

ψ₂ = 1/√2,

ψ₃ = -1/2.

Compute |ψ₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,

|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

|ψ₃|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Now, multiply each by the corresponding diagonal element of Pz.

Pz_11 = ħ,

Pz_22 = 0,

Pz_33 = -ħ.

So,

⟨Pz⟩ = |ψ₁|² * ħ + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ)

= (1/4) ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) 

= (1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ) = 0.

So the expectation value of Pz is zero.

Now, what about ⟨Pz²⟩? Since Pz² is Pz multiplied by itself. But since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is just each diagonal element squared.

So Pz² will have elements (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2.

So Pz² matrix is:

[ ħ²   0     0  ]
[ 0    0     0  ]
[ 0    0    ħ² ]

So, the diagonal elements are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ is sum over |ψ_i|² * (Pz²)_ii.

Which is:

|ψ₁|² * ħ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ħ².

Plugging in the values:

(1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ⟨Pz²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ − ⟨Pz⟩²).

Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, this simplifies to sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (√(1/2)) ħ = ħ / √2.

So the uncertainty ΔPz is ħ over square root of 2.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as a column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with matrix:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 P_z^{ii}.
\]

The components of $|\psi\rangle$ are:
- $|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$,
- $|\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $|\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.

The diagonal elements of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Substituting these:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 (P_z^2)^{ii}.
\]

The diagonal elements of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Substituting these:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
