Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

The question says the benzene has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon, right? So if one is in position 1, the others would be in 3 and 5, but wait, that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Maybe I should sketch this out.

Wait, the substituents are all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. Let me think about that. If I have three substituents, each pair should be meta. Hmm, that suggests a sort of triangular arrangement on the benzene ring. So perhaps positions 1, 3, and 5? Because each is two positions apart from the others. Yeah, that makes sense because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 3, and 5 are all meta to each other. So the three substituents are in 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but the question also mentions that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So the carboxylic acid is at a certain position, and its adjacent (ortho) positions have OH and N(CH3)2.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So if the carboxylic acid is in position
