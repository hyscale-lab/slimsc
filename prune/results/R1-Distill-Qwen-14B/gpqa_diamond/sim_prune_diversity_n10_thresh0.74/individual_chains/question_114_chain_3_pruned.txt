Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form the corresponding butanoic acid.

Wait, so the first part involves a ketone reacting with cyanide. I remember that ketones undergoing nucleophilic addition, and when they react with HCN or CN- it's typically under specific conditions. Oh right, in the presence of acid, maybe? Like H3O+ as a catalyst. Because HCN is a weak acid and might not be strong enough on its own. So the reaction of ketones with CN- usually requires acid catalysis. So for the first part, reagent A is probably H3O+.

Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH3. When it reacts with CN-... wait, perhaps it's a hydroxy group being introduced. Oh, wait, nitrile group is CN. So maybe the reaction is adding the cyanide across the carbonyl. But wait, butanone is a ketone, so adding CN- would give a cyanohydrin. Yes, the addition of HCN to ketones forms cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin.

But in this case, the reagent is NaCN and A. Hmm, so NaCN provides CN- ions. So if the reaction is without acid, would that work? Or do we need an acid catalyst? Because HCN is a weak acid, and CN- is its conjugate base. For the addition to occur, I think the ketone's carbonyl needs to be protonated. So maybe H+ is needed as a catalyst.

So for the first reaction, the reagents would be NaCN and H3O+ (acid). Because that would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So that would make A as H3O+.

Then the second reaction: the cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) is reacting with H2O and some reagent B. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the nitrile group is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But wait, how? Oh, the second compound is a nitrile attached to an alcohol group. So when treated with water and some acid, maybe it's hydrolysis.

Wait, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. I think the typical conditions involve either strong acid or base. For example, using H2O with HCl (H+ catalyst) or something like that. Or maybe under basic conditions with heat, but that would give a sodium salt, which would then be acidified.

The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. When it reacts with B (which is H2O) to give the acid. So that's hydrolysis. Let me recall: the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. I think it's done in acidic conditions. So the reagent B would be HCl, providing H+ and Cl- as a catalyst. Because in the presence of H2O and HCl, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, and for the second, B is HCl. Looking at the options, let's check.

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That matches. So option A is a possibility.

Wait, but another thought: what about the
