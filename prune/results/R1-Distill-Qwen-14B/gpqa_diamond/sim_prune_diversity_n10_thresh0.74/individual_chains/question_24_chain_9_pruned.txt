Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions. Hmm, I remember that when certain reactions happen, like hydrogenation or decolorizing bromine, it can give clues about the structure of the compounds involved.

Alright, let me read the question again.

We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture X decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction (disproportionation) to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, and it's a solvent widely used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. Also, no conjugated multiple bonds in X's liquids.

We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

So, let's break it down.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually means it has double bonds (like alkenes) or maybe some other unsaturated groups. Decolorizing bromine via addition reactions—so X must have unsaturated compounds, maybe alkenes or alkynes.

Mixture Y is formed from the disproportionation of X. Disproportionation is when a substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in some reactions, one part gets more oxygen (or less, depending on the context), and another part gets less (or more). So, X must be a compound that can undergo this.

When X is treated with Pt and heated, it disproportionates to form Y. Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y must not have any double bonds anymore. Because bromine decolorizes via addition to double bonds; if Y doesn't do that, it probably doesn't have any.

But wait, X has two liquids, and Y is another mixture of two liquids. So, maybe X is a single compound that breaks down into two different products upon disproportionation.

Then, both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions to give Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. Let's calculate what that is.

Hydrogen's mass is about 1.008, and carbon is 12.01. Let's say the hydrocarbon is CnH2m. The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2m * 1.008) / (12.01n + 2m * 1.008) = 14.28% ≈ 0.1428.

Hmm, perhaps it's simpler to think of it as the formula: for a hydrocarbon, the H% is (2m)/(12n + 2m) * 100 = 14.28.

Let me rearrange that. Let’s denote the formula as CnH2m.

So, 100*(2m)/(12n + 2m) ) =14.28 → 2m/(12n +2m) )= 0.1428 → 2m = 0.1428*(12n +2m)
Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 20000m = 1428*(12n +2m)
Wait, maybe I should just find m and n that satisfy this ratio. Let's try some small numbers.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, let's see: 14.28% = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428.

So, 2m/(12n + 2m) = 1/7 → cross-multiplying: 14m =12n +2m → 12m =12n → m = n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. That's a saturated hydrocarbon, an alkane since there are no double or triple bonds. So, the formula is CnH2n, which is an alkane.

What alkanes have a hydrogen mass fraction of approximately 14.28%?

Let me calculate for n=1: CH4. H% is (4)/(16)=25%. No.

n=2: C2H4? Wait, but wait, C2H4 is an alkene, but under severe hydrogenation, it would become C2H6. Hmm, but Z is the product after hydrogenation. So Z is the saturated product.

Wait, the question says that when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z. So, Z is the fully hydrogenated form.

Wait, but X is a mixture that decolorizes bromine, which indicates it has double bonds. So X's components are unsaturated (like alkenes, maybe).

When X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z, which is a saturated hydrocarbon. Similarly, Y is a mixture that also hydrogenates to Z.

So, Y must be a mixture of some other compounds that when hydrogenated, also form Z.

Wait, but Y is formed as a result of X's disproportionation. So Y is a mixture of products from X's disproportionation.

Disproportionation of X under Pt and heat gives Y, which is a mixture of two liquids. Then, hydrogenation of Y gives Z, same as X's hydrogenation.

So, since Y's hydrogenation gives Z, and X's does too, perhaps X and Y are different but related compounds that upon hydrogenation give the same Z.

Hmm, perhaps X is an alkene, and Y is a mixture of an alkane and something else.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So, Y must not have any double bonds. So, Y's compounds are saturated. So, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it breaks down into two saturated compounds (since Y doesn't react with bromine).

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, which when treated with Pt and heat, undergoes disproportionation to form Y, another mixture of two liquids.

Wait, maybe X is a single compound that undergoes disproportionation to form two products, which are in Y. So X isn't a mixture but a single liquid, but the problem says X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, the question says X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. So two different compounds in X. Each of these can undergo some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two similar compounds, maybe different alkenes. But when treated with Pt and heat, each undergoes disproportionation to form different products.

Wait, but the question says the result is a mixture Y of two other liquids, which suggests that each component in X may have undergone a reaction to form another compound each, but perhaps in a way that Y still has two components.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about specific examples of disproportionation reactions.

A classic example is the decomposition of potassium chlorate (though that's not a liquid). For organic compounds, maybe something like the disproportionation of an alkene into an alkane and another compound? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is a diene, could it undergo some reaction that breaks it into smaller alkenes or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe X contains a conjugated diene that, upon heating with a catalyst, undergoes some cleavage.

Wait, but the problem says that X has no conjugated multiple bonds. Oh, right, the question states: "There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X." So X's components are not conjugated. So any double bonds are isolated.

This makes me think that the double bonds in X are isolated, perhaps terminal.

Wait, but when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes disproportionation, leading to Y. So perhaps each component of X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation (but wait, no, because Y is formed from X with Pt and heat, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. No, more likely, it's an addition reaction or a hydrogenation.)

Wait, maybe X's components are alkenes, and when treated with Pt (a catalyst) and heat, they undergo some kind of hydrogenation. But wait, the problem says when X is treated with Pt and heated, then a disproportionation occurs, leading to Y. So it's a decomposition reaction, perhaps involving the breakdown of an alkene into smaller molecules.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X undergo some kind of hydrogenolysis or hydrogenation. But then Y would have different products. But since Y doesn't decolorize bromine, Y's compounds are saturated.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkenes in X undergo a reaction that converts each molecule into two smaller molecules, which are saturated. For example, maybe a di-substituted alkene breaking into two alkanes.

Wait, for example, if X is 1,2-diphenylethylene or something, but that's not a
