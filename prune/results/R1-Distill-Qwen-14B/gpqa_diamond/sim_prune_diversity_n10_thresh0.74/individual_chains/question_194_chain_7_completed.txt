Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Beta is 1/(kT). I need to find Z, the partition function.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E). But wait, each state corresponds to a particular configuration of S1, S2, S3. Since each spin has two possible values, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 possibilities. Let me think about the energy expression. The energy depends on the product of each pair of spins. Each pair contributes a term S_i S_j multiplied by -J. So the total energy is -J times the sum of these products.

Each S_i S_j term can be either +1 or -1. Let me consider each possible case.

Each spin is either +1 or -1. So for each pair S_i S_j, the product is +1 if the two spins are the same, and -1 if they are different.

Wait, but in the energy expression, each term is S_i S_j. So let's compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Each term is either +1 or -1. So the sum can vary.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum. Since there are three terms, each ±1, the sum can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Wait, no, not exactly. Let's see: the maximum sum is when all three products are +1, so sum is 3. The minimum is when all are -1, sum is -3. But wait, is it possible for the sum to be 1 or -1?

Wait, let's see. Each term in the sum is S_i S_j. Let me think about how many possible ways the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, for three pairs, each ±1, the sum can be:

3: all three are +1.

1: two +1, one -1. Because 2*(+1) + (-1) = 1.

-1: two -1, one +1. Because 2*(-1) + (+1) = -1.

-3: all three are -1.

Wait, but can the sum be 0? Let me see: for example, if two are +1 and one is -1 but in a way that their sum is zero. Let's compute.

Wait, 2*(+1) + (-1) = 1, not zero. Or 1*(+1) + 2*(-1) = -1. So no, the sum can't be zero. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

So the possible values of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) are 3,1,-1,-3.

Then, the energy E is -J times this sum.

So E = -J (sum), which would be -3J, -J, +J, +3J.

Wait, let me clarify:

If sum is 3: E = -J *3 = -3J.

Sum is 1: E = -J *1 = -J.

Sum is -1: E = -J*(-1) = +J.

Sum is -3: E = -J*(-3) = +3J.

Okay, now I need to find the number of states (microstates) that correspond to each possible sum.

Each microstate is a configuration (s1, s2, s3), each s_i is ±1.

So for each microstate, I can compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So let's list all 8 possible states and compute the sum for each.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3.

2. (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

3. (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

5. (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

6. (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

7. (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

8. (-1, -1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3.

Wait, wait, let me double-check some calculations.

Let me take state 3: (+1, -1, +1)

S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

So S1S2 = (+1)*(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = (+1)*(+1) = +1.

S2S3 = (-1)*(+1) = -1.

Sum: -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1. Correct.

Similarly, state 2: (+1, +1, -1)

S1S2 = 1*1=1.

S1S3=1*(-1)=-1.

S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1= -1.

So state 2 has sum -1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for sum 3, only two states: all +1 and all -1.

Wait, looking at the 8 states:

Which states have sum 3? State 1: all +1, sum 3.

State 8: all -1, sum 3?

Wait, no. Wait, when all spins are -1, each product is (+1), so sum is 3.

Yes, so state 8 has sum 3.

What about state 2,3,4,5,6,7: each has sum -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because according to my earlier calculation, the sum is (for state 2) -1, same as others.

Wait, but that would mean that the sum is 3 in two states (all +1 and all -1), and sum -1 in six states. Then what about the other possibilities for the sum?

Wait, I thought the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But according to this, the sum can't be 1 or -3 in any state.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the possible sums. Let me think again.

Wait, when summing three terms of ±1, the possible sums are: 3, 1, -1, -3.

But in the 8 states, the sum is either 3 or -1. Because in all the cases I computed, only states 1 and 8 have sum 3, all others have sum -1.

Wait, that's confusing because that would mean that the possible sums are 3 and -1.

But earlier I thought that the sum can take 3,1,-1,-3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the enumeration. Let me recheck some states.

Take state 3: (+1, -1, +1): sum is -1.

What about a state where two terms are +1 and one is -1.

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Wait, that's state 2. The sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

What about a different state, like S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

Wait, that's state3. Sum is -1.

Wait, perhaps all the states except the two all-same cases have sum -1.

Wait, that's 6 states with sum -1 and 2 states with sum 3.

Wait, that would mean that the possible sums are 3 and -1 only.

Wait, that can't be right. Because with three terms, each ±1, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. So there must be some states where the sum is 1 or -3.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the state enumeration.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of +1 and -1 in each state and how that affects the sum.

Wait, each product S_i S_j is +1 if the two spins are the same, -1 if they're different.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the number of pairs that are same minus the number of pairs that are different.

Since there are three pairs, the sum can be:

If all three pairs are same: sum=3.

If two are same, one different: sum=2*1 + (-1) =1.

If one same, two different: sum=1*1 + 2*(-1) =-1.

If all three pairs different: sum= -3.

Wait that makes sense.

So the sum can indeed be 3,1,-1,-3.

So why in all the states except 1 and 8, the sum is -1? That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum for some states.

Let me pick a state where two spins are the same and the third is different. Let's say S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. That's state 2.

Compute the sum:

S1S2 = 1.

S1S3 = -1.

S2S3 = -1.

So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So sum is -1.

But according to the earlier analysis, if two are same and one different, the sum should be 1.

Hmm, this is conflicting. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the way I count same and different is different.

Wait, when two spins are same and the third is different, how does that affect the number of same pairs?

Wait, let me think: if two spins are same and the third is different, how many same pairs are there?

Example: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

The same pairs are S1S2 (same), and the different pairs are S1S3 and S2S3.

So same pairs: 1.

Different pairs: 2.

So the sum would be (1*1) + (2*(-1)) = 1 -2 = -1. Which matches the earlier calculation.

But according to my earlier thought, when two are same, one different, the sum should be 1. So this must be wrong.

Ah, I see the mistake. The earlier logic was wrong.

Wait, the sum is (number of same pairs) * 1 + (number of different pairs)* (-1).

If two same and one different:

Same pairs: Let's see. For the triplet (same, same, different), how many same pairs?

In (S1,S2,S3) = (+1, +1, -1):

S1 and S2 are same.

S1 and S3 are different.

S2 and S3 are different.

So same pairs: 1.

Different pairs: 2.

So sum = 1*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 1-2 =-1.

So in that case, the sum is -1.

Which contradicts my earlier thinking that two same and one different would lead to sum 1.

Wait, so perhaps my initial expectation about the sum when two are same is incorrect.

So perhaps the sum when two are same and one different is -1, and when one is same and two different, the sum is -3?

Wait, no. Let's take another state where one spin is same, and two are different.

Wait, let's take S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

So S1 is same as S3? No, S1 is +1, S3 is -1. So S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=1.

Sum: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.

So same, sum is -1.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again about the possible sums.

Wait, perhaps the sum can only be 3, 0, or -3. But that doesn't fit with earlier calculations either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the possible sums for all 8 states.

Let me list all 8 possible states and compute the sum.

1. All +1: S1=1, S2=1, S3=1.

Sum: (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.

2. S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Sum: 1*1 +1*(-1) +1*(-1) =1-1-1 =-1.

3. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1.

Sum:1*(-1) +1*1 + (-1)*1 =-1+1-1= -1.

4. S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Sum:1*(-1) +1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) =-1-1 +1 =-1.

5. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1.

Sum: (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 +1*1 =-1-1+1= -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1.

Sum: (-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) +1*(-1) =-1 +1 -1= -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1.

Sum: (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1 =1-1-1 =-1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

Sum: (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1+1+1=3.

Wait, so according to this, all 8 states have sum either 3 or -1.

Wait, that's strange because I thought that when two spins are same and one different, the sum would be 1. But according to this, no state has sum 1 or -3.

Wait, that's confusing. So perhaps my initial assumption about possible sums was wrong, and the sum can only be 3 or -1.

But that doesn't make sense because for three pairs, each can be +1 or -1, so possible sums are 3,1,-1,-3.

Wait, but according to the enumeration, no state has sum 1 or -3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm counting.

Wait, let me think. Are there any states where the sum is 1?

Let's take S1=1, S2=1, S3=1: sum is 3.

S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1: sum is -1.

S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1: sum -1.

S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1: sum -1.

S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1: sum -1.

S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1: sum -1.

S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1: sum -1.

S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1: sum 3.

So all states have sum either 3 or -1.

Wait, so that can't be. I must have made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that each pair product can contribute to the sum is being handled correctly. Maybe the sum can only take on two values for this specific system.

Wait, but that would mean that all the states contribute to either E = -3J or E= J.

Because E = -J*(sum), so if sum is 3, E = -3J. Sum is -1: E= J.

Wait, let me check that:

sum is 3 → E = -3J.

sum is -1 → E = J.

So the possible energies are -3J and J.

So how many states have E = -3J? The states where sum is 3 → only states 1 and 8.

E = J → all other 6 states.

So the partition function is the sum over all states of exp(-beta E).

So each state contributes exp(-beta E).

But wait, wait. Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E). So for each state, compute the energy, then take the exponential.

But another approach is to group states with the same energy. Because each state with same E contributes the same term.

So for E =-3J: 2 states → each contributes exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J).

For E= J: 6 states → each contributes exp(-beta*(J)).

So Z = 2 * exp(3 beta J) + 6 * exp(-beta J).

Wait, that's the expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Z=2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ) → No, because it's 2 e^(-3Jβ) which would correspond to E=3J, but our E is -3J.

Wait, wait. Wait, E is -3J for sum=3.

So, exp(-beta E) = exp(-beta*(-3J))= exp(3 beta J).

Similarly, E=J: exp(-beta J).

So for E=-3J, the term is exp(3 beta J). For E=J, the term is exp(-beta J).

So the partition function is Z = 2 * e^{3 beta J} + 6 * e^{- beta J}.

Looking at the options, option A is Z=2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ). That's the reverse.

Option B: Z=2e^{3Jβ}+6e^{-Jβ} → That's correct.

Wait, option B is the correct one.

So the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the given energy expression:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
The energy depends on the sum \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), which can take the following values:
- If all spins are the same (\( +1, +1, +1 \) or \( -1, -1, -1 \)), the sum is \( 3 \), leading to \( E = -3J \).
- For all other configurations, the sum is \( -1 \), leading to \( E = J \).

Thus, there are two distinct energy levels:
- \( E = -3J \) for 2 states (all spins aligned).
- \( E = J \) for the remaining 6 states.

### Step 2: Partition Function
The partition function \( Z \) is the sum over all states of \( \exp(-\beta E) \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Grouping states by energy:
\[
Z = 2 \cdot \exp(-\beta (-3J)) + 6 \cdot \exp(-\beta J).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
Z = 2 \cdot e^{3J\beta} + 6 \cdot e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) — Incorrect, as it reverses the exponents.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) — Correct, matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, incorrect exponents.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) — Incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
