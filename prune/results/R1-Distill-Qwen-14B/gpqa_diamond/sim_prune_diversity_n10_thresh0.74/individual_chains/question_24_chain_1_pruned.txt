Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heat, it forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar but doesn't decolorize bromine water. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions with Pt, give a single hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent widely used, like maybe something common.

Hmm, I remember that hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if X decolorizes bromine water, that suggests the presence of double bonds because alkenes react with bromine. But since X is a mixture, maybe it has two different alkenes or something similar.

Wait, but when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation is when a substance is both oxidized and reduced. So if X has a molecule that can disproportionate, maybe something like an alkene that breaks into smaller or larger molecules with different functional groups.

But Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have double bonds anymore. Oh, because if it had double bonds, bromine would still decolorize it. So Y must have single bonds only. But wait, if X had alkenes, and Y is from a disproportionation, maybe X is something like an alkyne? Because when alkynes hydrogenate, they can form alkenes or other structures. No, wait, but Y doesn't have double bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diene or something else. Wait, but the problem states that mixture X's compounds have no conjugated multiple bonds. So if X has alkenes, they are not conjugated. So maybe each compound in X has a single double bond, but not conjugated, like isolated double bonds.

When X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. But Y doesn't have double bonds, so maybe the double bonds in X are hydrogenated. But wait, that would just make Y a mixture of alkanes, but the problem says Y is formed via a disproportionation. Oh, maybe X is something that can split into parts, like a di-substituted alkene breaking into smaller molecules.

Wait, let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps X and Y are different forms that, upon hydrogenation, lead to the same product Z. For example, maybe X is an alkene and Y is an alkyne, but wait, no. Alternatively, Y could be a di-substituted benzene ring or something else.

Wait, when you hydrogenate a benzene ring, it becomes cyclohexane. But if X and Y are such that their hydrogenation gives the same product, perhaps X and Y are isomers. Maybe X is a di-substituted alkene and Y is a di-substituted alkyne? Or perhaps X is a mixture of
