Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The given stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex. The stability constant, K, tells us how stable that complex is. A high K means the complex is very stable, so the metal is tightly bound.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So, the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. The question is, what's the concentration of free calcium ions in solution?

I think the key here is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction would be something like Ca-EDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-. The stability constant K is for the formation of the complex. So, the expression for K would be [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[Ca-EDTA^2-] = K.

Wait, right. So, K is the formation constant, which is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. So, if K is large, the complex doesn't dissociate much, meaning [Ca^2+] would be very low.

In this case, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model this.

Initial concentrations:
[Ca-EDTA^2-] = 0.02 M
[Ca^2+] = 0 (because initially, all Ca is in the complex)
[EDTA^4-] = 0 (same reason)

Change:
Let’s say the complex dissociates by x. So:
[Ca-EDTA^2-] decreases by x → 0.02 - x
[Ca^2+] increases by x → x
[EDTA^4-] increases by x → x

At equilibrium:
[Ca-EDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x (since K is so large, and x should be very small, maybe x is negligible compared to 0.02)
So, I can approximate [Ca-EDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Then, K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [Ca-EDTA^2-] = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x^2 / 0.02.

Wait, K is 5e10, so plugging that in: 5e10 = x² / 0.02 → x² = 5e10 * 0.02 → x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 31622.7766… around 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can’t be right because that would mean the concentration of calcium is 3e4 M, which is way higher than the initial 0.02 M.
