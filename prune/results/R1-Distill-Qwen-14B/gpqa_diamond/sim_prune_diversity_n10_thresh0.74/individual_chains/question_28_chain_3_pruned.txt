Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to visualize each reaction and what's happening structurally.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, the structure is a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4. The configuration is S, which I'll have to keep in mind because stereochemistry matters in each step.

First reaction: treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine. I remember that TBS is a protecting group, usually for hydroxyls. It's a silyl protecting group, which is good to know because silylation typically occurs under basic conditions, like with TEA. So, the hydroxyl on carbon 4 would get silylated. So product 1 should be 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Wait, but I should double-check the structure. The starting molecule is 4-hydroxy, so after silylation, it's 4-TBS. The cyclohexenone would remain as is. So product 1 is 4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Ph2CuLi is a strong base and a good nucleophile. I think it's used for conjugate additions or maybe for deprotonating something. Alternatively, in some cases, it can induce elimination.

Wait, but the starting material here is a cyclohexenone. So let me think about where the reaction will occur. Cyclohexenone has a carbonyl group (the ketone), and adjacent to that is the double bond (enone system). Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, often used in conjugate additions. So perhaps it's adding to the enone.

Wait, but in what way? The enone has a ketone at position 1 and the double bond between 2 and 3. So the enone is in positions 1,2,3. So if Ph2CuLi does a conjugate addition, it would add to the alpha position. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-addition.

Wait, when using a Gilman reagent with an enone, it typically adds to the alpha position. The enolate would form, and the CuLi would deliver the aryl group. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexenone is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. Ph2CuLi is a strong organocuprate which can perform conjugate additions to enones. So the cyclohexenone would have the Gilman reagent add to the beta position, leading to a new substituent there.

Wait, the structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the ketone is at C1. A conjugate addition would target the alpha position, which would be C2 or C3?

Wait, the enone is 1,2,3. So the carbonyl is at 1, double bond between 2 and 3. So in a 1,4-addition, the organocuprate would add to carbon 4. But wait, cyclohexenone doesn't have a carbon 4 in that context. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, the starting compound is 4-hydroxy cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So the ring is cyclohexane, with a ketone at C1, a double bond between C2 and C3 (so positions 2 and 3), and a hydroxyl (now silylated) at C4.

So when Ph2CuLi is added, it's likely adding to the enone. Conjugate addition (1,4 addition) would add the aryl group to the alpha carbon. But in an enone, the alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the ketone, so C2 and C3. But wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so adding to either would change the structure.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexenone is opening up. The addition would occur at position C3, making a new bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another possibility: the enone can undergo a conjugate addition leading to a new substituent at C3. So the organocuprate adds to C3, and then perhaps the ring opens or something else happens.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. After the addition, the next step is benzyl bromide. So perhaps the cuprate adds a benzyl group, or something else happens. Alternatively, maybe it
