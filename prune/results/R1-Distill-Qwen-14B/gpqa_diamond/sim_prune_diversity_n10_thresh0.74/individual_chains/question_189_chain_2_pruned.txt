Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetries. Hmm. Let me think about what each of these particles is related to.

The question is asking which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the underlying laws have a certain symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry. Like how a spinning top can wobble but still have the same average motion.

So, particles that emerge from such broken symmetries are called Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that for each continuous symmetry that's spontaneously broken, there's a corresponding massless boson. But wait, some of these options might not be Goldstone bosons.

Let me go through each option:

A) Phonon: Phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the breaking of translational symmetry when a crystal forms. Because the crystal has a periodic structure, the continuous translational symmetry (you can translate by any amount) is broken to a discrete symmetry (only certain translations are allowed). So phonons are the Goldstone bosons here. So phonons are associated with broken symmetry.

B) Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons, right? They were proposed by Skyrme to model the pion as a soliton in a theory of nuclear matter. Skyrmions arise from chiral symmetry breaking in the context of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). So yes, they are tied to a spontaneously broken symmetry.

C) Magnon: Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in a magnetic material. They come from the breaking of the continuous spin rotation symmetry in a magnetically ordered state. For example, when a magnetic material gets magnetized, the continuous rotational symmetry (you can rotate the spins by any angle) is broken to a discrete symmetry (say, only rotations about the direction of the magnetization). So magnons are Goldstone bosons of that broken symmetry.

D) Pion: Pions are the Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the low-energy limit of QCD, and the pions (π⁰, π⁺, π⁻) are the massless bosons arising from this symmetry breaking. However, because of the electromagnetic interactions and the axial anomaly, the pions aren't exactly massless, but they are still associated with the broken symmetry.

So the question is which one is NOT associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. All the options except maybe one are linked to SSB. Let me review:

Phonon: yes, broken translational symmetry.
Skyrmion: yes, chiral symmetry breaking.
Magnon: yes, spin symmetry breaking.
Pion: yes, chiral symmetry.

Wait, so all of them are associated with SSB? That can't be right because the question says one isn't.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again about each particle.

Phonon: yes, from crystal's broken translational symmetry.

Skyrmion: skyrmions are associated with the pion, which is a Goldstone boson. So skyrmion itself is a soliton solution in a theory, but the pion is the Goldstone. But the question is about the particle itself.

Wait, Skyrmion is a solution in a theory where chiral symmetry is broken. So Skyrmion is a topological excitation due to that symmetry breaking. So yes, it's linked to SSB.

Magnon: yes, from the broken spin rotation symmetry in a magnet. So associated with SSB.

Pion: yes, as mentioned.

So all four options are associated with SSB. But that can't be the case because the question says which is not. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the phonon again. Phonons are the Goldstone bosons for broken translational symmetry. But in the case of crystals, the translational symmetry is broken, so phonons are the Goldstone bosons. So phonon is a Goldstone. So it's associated with SSB.

So all options are connected to SSB? Hmm, that can't be the case. So perhaps one of them isn't.

Wait, perhaps the pion is not a Goldstone boson anymore? Like, in reality, pions have mass, so does that mean the symmetry isn't completely broken? Or maybe the pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson because the symmetry is approximate.

But the question is about which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. So perhaps the pion is associated, but maybe one of the others isn't.

Wait, another angle: Skyrmions are more about the topological structure rather than arising directly from the broken symmetry. Or maybe they are a model for the pion but aren't the Goldstone themselves.

Alternatively, could any of these particles result from a different kind of symmetry, not spontaneous breaking?

Wait, wait. Maybe the phonon isn't a Goldstone boson. Because phonons arise from the quantization of vibrations in a crystal. The underlying symmetry broken is translational, but perhaps in that case, the phonon isn't a Goldstone boson? Or it is?

Wait, the phonon is a Goldstone boson of the broken translational symmetry. So that's correct.
