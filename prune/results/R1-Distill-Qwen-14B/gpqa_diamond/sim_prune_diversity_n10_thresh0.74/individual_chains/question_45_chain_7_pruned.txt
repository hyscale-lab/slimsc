Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle has a certain energy based on its quantum number.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh wait, spin-1/2 means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), which is given as E multiplied by n squared. So E is the base unit here, and each energy level is E multiplied by the square of the quantum number n.

Since the particles are identical fermions, their wavefunctions must be antisymmetric. So I need to figure out how to arrange the four particles in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about the possible quantum numbers each particle can have. In a 1D well, each state is determined by the principal quantum number n. For identical particles, each must have a unique combination of quantum numbers, but since they're spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down). So maybe each spatial state can accommodate two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, but how does this apply when there are four particles? Let's consider the spatial part first. The ground state would have the lowest possible n's filled, but considering that each spatial state can take two particles (with opposite spins), we can have multiple particles in the same n but different spins.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible n's filled. Let's start filling up the energy levels.

The first energy level is n=1. Since each n can hold two particles (because of spin up and down), n=1 can hold 2 particles.

Next is n=2, which can hold another 2 particles. But wait, we have four particles. So n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 2, and that's all four. So the ground state would have all four particles in the two lowest energy levels.

Wait, but wait, the energy of the system is the sum of each particle's energy. So each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1)^2 = E,
