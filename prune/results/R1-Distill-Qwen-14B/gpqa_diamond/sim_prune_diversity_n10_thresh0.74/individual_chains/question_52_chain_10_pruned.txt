Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and think through each part carefully.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization state of atoms depends on temperature, and their population in different energy levels depends on the Saha equation and Boltzmann distribution.

So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but I think the spots are cooler regions, so they make the star emit less flux. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Wait, I'm a bit confused. How does the spot coverage affect the overall Teff?

Wait, the star's total luminosity is the sum of the areas. Oh, right. The star's total luminosity is the integral over the surface of the flux from each area element. So if 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature (spots), and the rest is at 6000 K, what's the overall effective temperature?

But in the problem, they say the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So maybe that's the result of the spots. So maybe I don't need to calculate that myself, but just use the given Teff values. 

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So the question is asking: what's the factor by which the ratio (level 1 / level 2) changes when there are no spots (normal) compared to when spots are present.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near UV or maybe the far UV. But more importantly, that's the wavelength for which the Ti lines are being considered.

In the stellar photosphere, when in LTE, the population ratio between two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2)
