Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle meet, they annihilate and produce energy, usually in the form of photons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll have to think this through.

The problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. So their speeds are pretty high, considering gamma values above 1 imply they're moving at relativistic speeds.

When they collide and annihilate, they produce two photons. The question states that both photons have the same energy. Interesting. Also, their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below.

I need to find the angle between the two photons' directions. The options are in degrees, so it's a matter of calculating the angle based on their directions.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Since no external forces are acting, both momentum and energy must be conserved. But wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, things might be easier. Because in that frame, the total momentum should be zero before the collision. Let me check.

Wait, no. Before the collision, the electron and positron are moving towards each other. So their momenta are opposite. But are they equal in magnitude? Since they have different Lorentz factors, their relativistic masses will be different, so their momenta might not cancel each other.

Let me calculate their momenta. The momentum (p) of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m * v. But wait, another formula I remember is p = gamma * m * c * beta, where beta is v/c. But since we're working in units where c=1, maybe I can simplify.

Electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? So m_e is the same for both. Let me denote m as the rest mass.

For the electron moving to the right (from left, so direction is positive x-axis), gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, but velocity v is related to beta as beta = v/c. Oh wait, but in terms of gamma, we can relate beta and gamma. The relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So for the electron: gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968. So beta_e ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron: gamma_p =2. So beta_p = sqrt(1 - (
