Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm trying to figure out. Let's see, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copies. He did three technical replicates at each concentration. The qPCR efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that a slope around -3.3 is typical for a 100% efficient qPCR because the formula for the slope in the linear range of a qPCR standard curve is ln(10)/slope. Wait, with a slope of -3.3, that would be ln(10)/3.3 ≈ 2.3026/3.3 ≈ 0.698, which is close to 1, so that's correct for 100% efficiency. So the curve is probably a perfect fit because R² is 1. So the data points should all lie perfectly on the line.

Looking at the data, each concentration has three Ct values. Let's see, for 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be (33.9 +34.2 +34.5)/3 = 34.2. Similarly, for 10,000: 30.9 average. 1,000: 27.6. 100: 24.3. 10: 21.0.

Wait, but according to a standard curve, each 10-fold dilution should result in an increase of 3.3 in Ct, right? Because each 10x dilution would reduce the starting quantity by 10, and with 100% efficiency, each cycle corresponds to a 2x increase. So the relationship is Ct = log10 (starting quantity) * (-slope) + intercept. The slope is -3.3, so each 10x increase in concentration would decrease Ct by 3.3.

So let's see the differences between the concentrations:

100,000 to 10,000 is a 10-fold dilution. The Ct at 100,000 is ~34.2, and at 10,000 is ~30.9. The difference is about 3.3. That's correct.

10,000 to 1,000: Ct goes from 30.9 to 27.6. Again, 3.3 difference. Perfect.

1,000 to 100: 27.6 to 24.3. 3.3. Correct.

100 to 10: 24.3 to 21. Difference is 3.3. Perfect.

So the trend is spot on. But wait, each point has three replicates. Let me check the individual replicates.

For 100,000, the Ct values are about 34. The next concentration is 10,000
