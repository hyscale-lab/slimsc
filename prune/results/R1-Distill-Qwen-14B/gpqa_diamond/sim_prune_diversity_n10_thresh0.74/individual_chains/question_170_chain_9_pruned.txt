Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured the spin many times on identically prepared systems.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Spinors are usually represented as Ψ = [ψ₁, ψ₂]^T, where ψ₁ and ψ₂ are complex numbers.

The problem is to find the expectation value of S_y. I recall that the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: <S_y> = <Ψ| S_y |Ψ>. 

But wait, what's the S_y operator for an electron spin-½ system? Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The spin operator components are given in terms of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix.

Looking back, the σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate <Ψ| S_y |Ψ>. Let me break this down into steps.

First, express S_y in terms of the Pauli matrix. So S_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Now, the state vector Ψ is [3i, 4]^T. Let me denote Ψ as a column vector:

Ψ = [3i; 4]. Wait, but when I take the bra vector, which is Ψ†, it's [3i*, 4*], right? So the complex conjugate transpose.

So Ψ† is [ -3, 4 ] since (3i)* is -3 (because i* is -i, so 3i* is 3*(-i) = -3i? Wait, wait, 3i is a complex number. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, not -3. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let's think: if ψ₁ is 3i, then ψ₁* is -3i. So the first component becomes -3i. Wait, but
