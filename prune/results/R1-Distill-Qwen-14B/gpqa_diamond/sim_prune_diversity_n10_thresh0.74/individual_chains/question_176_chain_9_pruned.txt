Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, actually, I should remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically unit vectors. So I need to check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the state vector is not normalized yet. Oh wait, so maybe the given state is actually a vector that needs to be normalized first.

Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...". So I should probably normalize it. So the actual state vector |Ïˆ> would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Because when you take the inner product, you multiply each component by its conjugate, but since all are real, it's just the sum of squares.

Next, the problem involves measuring P and then Q. The question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q right after.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the next measurement is on the same state? Or on the state after the first measurement? Because if you measure P first, the system will collapse into an eigenstate of
