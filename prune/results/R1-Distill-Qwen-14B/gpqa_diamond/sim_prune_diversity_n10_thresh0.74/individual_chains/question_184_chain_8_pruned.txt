Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). Wait, no, actually, benzene is numbered such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So I should imagine the substituents in the correct positions. Let me think: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering starts so that the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the order of substituents when adding them.

Synthesis steps usually involve various electrophilic substitutions, maybe some nitration, sulfonation, alkylation, and so on. Oh, and sometimes reduction steps, but looking at the options, there are nitration steps, sulfonations, and some substitutions involving NaOH, EtBr, etc.

Wait, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about the possible order of adding these groups. The order is important because each substitution affects the next due to directing effects.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's consider the substituents:

1. tert-butyl group: This is a strong activating, o/p-directing group. But wait, tert-butyl is a bulky substituent. Alkylation via Friedel-Crafts would be the method, but since tert-butyl chloride is bulky, it's usually done under specific conditions. Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

2. Nitro group: Nitration is done with HNO3 in H2SO4. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, once nitro is present
