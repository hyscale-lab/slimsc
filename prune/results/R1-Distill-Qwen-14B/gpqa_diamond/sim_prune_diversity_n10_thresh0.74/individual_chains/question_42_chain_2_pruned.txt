Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem states that all three planets have circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, right? But I don't think that directly affects this calculation because it's more about the timing of transits and how other planets influence them. The main info here is about their equilibrium temperatures and masses, along with albedos.

Wait, the question is about the orbital periods. So I remember that the orbital period depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star they're orbiting, but wait, the problem doesn't mention the star's mass. Oh wait, maybe we can assume all three are orbiting the same star, so the star's mass is the same for all three, right? So that would mean I can relate their periods using their semi-major axes.

The formula I remember is Kepler's third law, which in the case of a star is P² ∝ a³ / M_star. But since all planets are around the same star, M_star is constant, so P² ∝ a³. So if I can find the ratio of a for Planet3 to Planet1, I can square the cube root of that to get the period ratio.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the semi-major axes directly. It gives the equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios. So I'll have to find a way to relate temperature to semi-major axis, and then use that to find the period.

Equilibrium temperature formula: I think it's T = [(L (1 - abedo)) / (16 π σ a²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi-major axis. Since all planets have the same albedo (0.3 in this case), and same star, L is same for all, so T is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a).

So T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), so T1 = k / sqrt(a1), T2 = k / sqrt(a2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, let me double-check that. If T1 = k a1^(-1/2), then T1/T2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2) * (k/k) → T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So sqrt(a2/a1) = T1/T2. So a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, no, let me correct that. Let's rederive:

T is proportional to (L(1 - a)) / a² )^(1/4). So T = (L(1-a))^(1/4) * (a)^(-1/2). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a) * (L(1-a))^(1/4). But since L and (1-a) are same for all planets, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So, T1 / T2 = 1/(sqrt(a1)) / (1/(sqrt(a2))) ) = sqrt(a2/a1). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, no, if T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, and T2 that of Planet2, and if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, then Planet1 must be closer to the star because hotter implies shorter a. So, if T1 is higher than T2, a1 is smaller than a2.

Let me write that again. Given that T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), if T1 is higher than T2, then a1 < a2. So, for the first part, the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4. So that would mean sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4 → a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is 1.96 times a1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3. So again, T2 is higher than T3, so a2 < a3. So sqrt(a3/a2) = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = ~5.29.

Wait, wait. Wait, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. Does that mean T2 is 2.3 times higher than T3? Because the question says the ratio
