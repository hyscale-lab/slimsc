Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, based on the options provided, I'll select the correct answer.

So, the first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+, giving product A. The second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA, to give product B.

Let me break each down separately.

Starting with reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The structure of this compound is a spiro compound, which means two rings connected by a single atomâ€”in this case, the spiro atom is the one where the two rings meet. The formula is a bit complex, but I think the key here is the spiro structure and the presence of a double bond.

The reagents used are THF (a solvent), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and H+ (proton source, maybe workup). So, what kind of reaction conditions are these? Potassium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions.

In the context of spiro compounds, when a strong base is used, I'm thinking elimination reactions. Maybe an E2 mechanism? Because the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a double bond or a leaving group, leading to the formation of a new double bond or ring expansion.

Wait, the starting material has a double bond in the spiro structure. So, maybe the reaction is leading to a ring expansion via a hydride shift or some kind of sigmatropic rearrangement. Alternatively, since there's a vinyl group (the 1-vinyl part), perhaps a conjugate addition or elimination is happening.

Another thought: the spiro compound could undergo a [n.m]annulation or some bicyclic formation when the base abstracts a proton, leading to a new ring formation. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Cope elimination or some other elimination reaction.

Wait, 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The '1-ol' group is a hydroxyl attached to the spiro atom. So when you treat with a strong base like KH, you might deprotonate the hydroxyl group. But wait, the hydro
