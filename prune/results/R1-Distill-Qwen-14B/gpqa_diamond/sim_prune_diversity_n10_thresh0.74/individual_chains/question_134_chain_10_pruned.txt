Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think I need to figure out how much of each acid and base is present and then determine the limiting reagent. Because the enthalpy change depends on the amount of H+ and OH- ions reacting.

Let me write down what each solution provides. 

First, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. Wait, it's a diprotic acid, but since it's a strong acid, it dissociates in two steps, right? So first, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete, but the second one isn't. Wait, no, wait—sulfuric acid is considered a strong acid for the first dissociation. So the first H+ is completely ionized, but the second (HSO4- → H+ + SO4^2-) is only partially ionized. But in a solution, especially in dilute conditions, the second H+ is also considered to a significant extent. Hmm, but for the purpose of neutralization, when calculating the equivalents, I think we can assume that both H+ ions from H2SO4 are available. Or wait, no. Wait, usually, when calculating the equivalents for acid and base, H2SO4 is considered as providing 2 equivalents of H+ per mole.

Wait, but in the solution, for H2SO4, each mole gives two H+ ions. So the concentration would be 0.3 M, and volume 300 mL. So moles H2SO4 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M, 0.5 L. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 1 H+, so H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Molarity of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each provides 2 OH-, so moles OH- is 0.2 moles.

So, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases a certain amount of energy. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I think that's for when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-.

So I need to find out how much H+ and OH- are available, determine the limiting reactant, and compute the enthalpy change based on that.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 moles. Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait—H2SO4 is diprotic. Wait, wait, but in reality, the second H+ might not fully dissociate, especially in solution. But I think for the purpose of this problem, since it's an acid, we
