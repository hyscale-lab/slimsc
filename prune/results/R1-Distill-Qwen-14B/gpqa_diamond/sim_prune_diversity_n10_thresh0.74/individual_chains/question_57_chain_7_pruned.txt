Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me some phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and they tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Right, so I guess we're only considering up to l=4 or something like that. The incident electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of the partial waves. The formula involves a sum over the angular momentum quantum numbers l. The general expression is something like:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) ] 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. I think the imaginary part is given by the sum involving the sine of the phase shifts. Because the amplitude can be written as a sum of terms with e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So when you take the imaginary part, you're looking at the sinδ_l terms multiplied by other factors.
