Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right? They orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. 

Let me read the details again. Both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. I remember that the radial velocity method is used to detect exoplanets, but in this case, it's binary stars, so each star's velocity is measured.

Wait, the RV variations are sinusoidal because the stars are moving towards and away from us as they orbit. The amplitudes here probably represent the velocities of each star in their orbit. So for system_1, one star moves at 10 km/s, the other at 5 km/s. Similarly, system_2 has 15 and 10. 

I think the mass ratio comes into play here. The mass of each star is inversely proportional to their velocity because of how the center of mass works. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude since it's closer to the center. Oh right, the mass ratio q is (m2/m1) = (v1/v2), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of each star. Because m1*v1 = m2*v2, so q = m2/m1 = v1/v2.

Wait, but in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So m1/m2 = v2/v1, which would be 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5, meaning system_1 has a total mass of m1 + m2. Let me see:

In system_1, let m1 be the mass of the star with velocity 10, m2 the one with 5. So m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is half the mass of m2. So m1 = 0.5 * m2. Total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly for system_2: velocities 15 and 10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3) m2. Total mass M2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait, wait no. Wait, in system_2, which star has which velocity. Let me make sure. The problem says for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So m1's velocity is 10, m2's is 5. So m1 is less than m2 because velocity is inversely proportional to mass.

Wait, the equation is m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. So m1/m2 =
