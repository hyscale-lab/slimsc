Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, I remember that an isotropic potential is one that's the same in all directions, so the potential depends only on the radial distance r.

The potential given is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that's the standard form for a harmonic oscillator potential. So this is a 3D version, which means the particle's motion is like three independent 1D harmonic oscillators in x, y, and z directions. But wait, in spherical coordinates, the radial part is r, but the angular parts are independent. So the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized in a particular way.

I remember that in a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Or wait, another approach: I think the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, each 1D oscillator contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω to the energy. So in 3D, the total energy would be the sum of the three: (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but I also recall that sometimes the energy is expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω. That makes sense because each
