Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the seven crystal systems. Oh right, it's based on a cube that's been deformed, so all the edges are the same length, but the angles between them are different. Wait, but in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c, and each angle is 30°. Interesting.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I remember the formula for interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the Miller indices times some other terms involving the lattice parameters and angles.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is d = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk(1 - cos α) + hl(1 - cos β) + kl(1 - cos γ)) )) ). Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, that might be for a general case, but perhaps for a rhombohedral system, there's a simpler formula since a = b = c and all angles are equal.

Wait, another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) can be calculated using the formula derived from the general case. But maybe there's a specific formula for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but for non-cubic systems, especially rhombohedral, it's more complicated because of the angles.

Wait, another thought: the formula can be derived from the structure factor or from the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, maybe the formula for a rhombohedral system is d^2 = a² (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )^{-1}.

Wait, let me get this right. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/(a²) + k²/(b²) + l²/(c²)) + (2hk cos γ)/(ab) + (2hl cos β)/(ac) + (2kl cos α)/(bc) ) )

Hmm, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say), and alpha = beta = gamma = theta (30 degrees here). So substituting these into the formula.

So, substituting a = b = c = a0, and angles all equal to theta (30 degrees).

Let me write the denominator as:

( h²/a0² + k²/a0² + l²/a0² ) + (2hk cos theta)/(a0^2) + (2hl cos theta)/(a0^2) + (2kl cos theta)/(a0^2) )

Factor out 1/a0²:

= (1/a0²) [ h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta ]

So the reciprocal would be:

d^2 = 1 / [ (1/a0²) (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta) ) ]

So,

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos theta + 2hl cos theta + 2kl cos theta )

Wait, but wait. Because in the denominator, the expression is 1/(a0²) multiplied by the sum. Taking reciprocal, it's (a0²) / sum, so sqrt makes it a0 / sqrt(sum).

So, for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

So,

d = a0 / sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1)(1) cos theta + 2*(1)(1) cos theta + 2*(1)(1) cos theta )

Let me compute that:

Sum inside sqrt is 3 + 2*(1+1+1)* cos theta.

Wait, 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos theta, but since h=k=l=1, each term is 2*1*1* cos theta, and there are three such terms. So 2*(1+1+1) cos theta = 6 cos theta.

Wait wait, no, wait: hk is 1*1=1, same for hl and kl. So 2*(1 +1 +1) * cos theta = 6 cos theta.

So the sum is 3 + 6 cos theta.

So d = a0 / sqrt(3 + 6 cos theta )

Wait, but what's theta here? Theta is 30 degrees.

So cos(theta) is cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting:

Sum = 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2 ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3)

Because 6 * (sqrt(3)/2) is 3 sqrt(3).

So sum is 3 +
