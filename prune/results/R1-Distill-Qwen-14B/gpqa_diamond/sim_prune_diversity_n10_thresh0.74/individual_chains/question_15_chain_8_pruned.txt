Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should focus on that one. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method gives us the minimum mass of a planet because it relies on detecting the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet tugs on it. But since both planets have the same mass, as given in the question, that part doesn't affect the transit probability directly.

The main factors here are the orbital periods and the host stars' properties. The key is to determine the transit probability for each planet. From what I recall, the probability of a planet transiting its star is influenced by the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

Wait, wait. The transit probability formula, I think it's something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but squared? Or maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh right, the probability is approximately (R_star / a)^2, where R_star is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which is the orbital radius for a circular orbit). But wait, no, I think that's more the area of the star as seen from Earth relative to the planet's orbital area. Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet)² / (a²), but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_planet is negligible. So P ≈ (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

No, wait. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for a transit is given by (R_star / a) * (something else). Oh right, I think it's P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. Wait, no, maybe that's the impact parameter formula.

Actually, the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star / a)², because the area where a transit can occur is a certain fraction of the total possible area. So P = (R_star^2 / a^2) multiplied by some factor, maybe 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), but perhaps that's a simplified version. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's get back to the basics. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability of this alignment depends on the relative sizes of the star and the planet's orbit. The probability can be approximated as (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability of the inclination being just right. I think the exact formula is P = (R_star / a)² multiplied by something, or perhaps it's (R_star
