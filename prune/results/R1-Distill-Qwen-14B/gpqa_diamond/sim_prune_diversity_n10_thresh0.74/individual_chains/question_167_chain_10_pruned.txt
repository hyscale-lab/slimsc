Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). So for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, I need to plug these values in.

Wait, wait. Let me write down the given information clearly. The state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi) respectively. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So when you take a superposition of two coherent states, you get a non-Gaussian state, which is the essence of a Schrödinger cat state. That makes sense.

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

Wait a second, I remember that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So here, tau is that closest Gaussian state, which would minimize the relative entropy. So rho is our non-Gaussian state, and tau is the Gaussian state that's closest to rho in terms of relative entropy.

So to compute del_b, I need to find both rho and tau. Rho is straightforward, it's |psi><psi|, right? But computing the exact form might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute it without explicitly finding all the terms.

Wait, but wait. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho), but since rho is pure, rho ln rho would be zero, so the entropy is zero. Hmm, but in this case, rho is a pure state, so the entropy of rho is zero. But wait, the relative entropy is being calculated between rho and tau, which is a Gaussian state. So the formula is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh, wait, no, the formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is different. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the relative entropy measure here is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. So del_b equals S(rho) - S(tau). But wait, for pure states, S(rho) is zero, right? Because for a pure state, rho is a projector, so the entropy is zero. But tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is a thermal state or something else, its entropy might not be zero. Hmm, but wait, in this case, is tau a Gaussian state that's closest to rho, and could it be a mixed state?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (REG) is sometimes defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So for a pure state, this would involve comparing it to a Gaussian state that is as close as possible to it. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy measure del_b given here is actually the relative entropy between rho and tau, but the way it's written is a bit different. Let me think: del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau), but relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the cross entropy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the notation here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe for specific states, like the Schrödinger cat state, the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using some known formula, especially when using the relative entropy measure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian, which would make sense. But the question is about a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Wait, but let's think about the parameters. phi is -pi/4. So let's compute N first. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me compute sin(2phi) when phi = -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. So alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5, so exp(-
