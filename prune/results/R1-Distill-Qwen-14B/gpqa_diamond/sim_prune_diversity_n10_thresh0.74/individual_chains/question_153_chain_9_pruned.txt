Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually a conjugate base, like an enolate. The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction (A): It's dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under NaOEt and EtOH conditions. So, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base. In EtOH, which is a protic solvent. I think the base would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. Its structure has two methyl ester groups on a malonic acid. When deprotonated, the enolate would form at the alpha position, which is the central carbon next to the two carbonyl groups.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure should be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3. Wait, but wait, the position is 3, so the acrylate is CH2=C-O-C(p-tolyl)CH2? No, wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the substituents on either end.

Wait, I think acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but when it's 3-(p-tolyl), then it's CH2CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3, but wait, acrylate is CH2=CH
