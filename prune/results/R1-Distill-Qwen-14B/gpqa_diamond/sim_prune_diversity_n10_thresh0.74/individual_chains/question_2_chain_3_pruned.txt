Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then, each product goes through different reactions to form product 3. The question is asking how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, I need to go through each step one by one to track the structure changes.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. Its structure is something like CH₂=CH-C₆H₄-CHO. Wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde group is attached to a benzene ring via a propenyl group. So the structure is: benzaldehyde with a double bond. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Oh, right, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that can't be. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure Ph-CH₂-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a propene group attached to a benzene. So it's benzaldehyde where the benzene is connected via a CH₂-CH₂-CHO group? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, I think I confused it with something else. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound where the aldehyde is attached to a vinyl group. So it's: Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, I think the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CHO. Oh wait, no. No, wait, no. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure: the benzene ring is connected to a CH₂ group, which is connected to a CH₂ group, which is connected to an aldehyde group. Wait, that's not right
