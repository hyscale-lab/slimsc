Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So, the situation is about relative motion between two inertial frames. I'm trying to remember if this involves special relativity or just classical mechanics. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me check, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Not super high, but not negligible either. So relativistic effects might come into play here.)

But wait, the problem states that both are inertial frames. So, according to the principle of relativity, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. But I'm trying to find the distance traveled in one frame given time in another. So I probably need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the speed in that frame.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just a simple classical Doppler effect scenario. Let me read the question again. It says, in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

But wait, how do we relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the time in the galaxy's frame? Because if there's relative motion, time dilation might come into play. So maybe I should consider the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about acceleration, just inertial frames. So perhaps we can use the Lorentz transformation to relate time between the frames.

Let me try to set this up. Let's say the Galaxy frame is S, and the ejecta frame is S'. The S'
