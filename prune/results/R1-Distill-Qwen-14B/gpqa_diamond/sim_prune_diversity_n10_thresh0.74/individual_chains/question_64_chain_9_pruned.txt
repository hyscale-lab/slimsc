Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They are heated to 200Â°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, without cooling, these gases pass through three tubes in order.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. The second tube is a Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight didn't change. The third tube has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 grams, with CuO formed. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes and what the gases might be.

Starting with the setup: heating a mixture of salts without air. So probably a decomposition reaction. The products are gases, and these are passed through the tubes.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to dry gases because it absorbs water. So if the weight of the tube increased, the gas must have had water in it. So the gas that passed through had some water vapor, which was absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2. So the first gas is water vapor, H2O.

So, the amount of H2O is the mass gained. Let's compute that. The mass increase is 3.60 grams. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 moles of H2O were in the mixture of gases. That means that the decomposition of A and B produced H2O as one of the gases.

Next, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. I think Ca(OH)2 is a base that would react with acidic gases, like CO2, to form CaCO3 and water. If the weight didn't change, that suggests that no reaction happened. So, no CO2 passed through this tube. But wait, maybe CO2 was already absorbed or not present. Alternatively, maybe another gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Or perhaps the solution was saturated and couldn't absorb more. But the fact that it's a solution, maybe it's designed to capture CO2, but if the solution's weight didn't change, perhaps no CO2 was present.

Hmm, but wait, if the gas was something else, like maybe NH3, which is a base and wouldn't react with Ca(OH)2. Or perhaps the gas is something inert, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe some other gas is present.

Wait, but let me think further. The third tube is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have reacted with copper. What gases react with red-hot copper? Well, CO (carbon monoxide) can react with copper at high temperatures, but wait, CO is a reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S, but I don't think that's likely. Or maybe H2, but I'm not sure.

Wait wait, another possibility: water vapor might not react with copper, but if the gas is something like SO2 or CO, then perhaps it would cause a reaction. Alternatively, another thought: when H2O is present in the gas, but it's already been absorbed by tube 1. So the gas that went into tube 3 is another gas. Let's think.

The
