Hmm, okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic mixture. Let me think through it step by step.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. First, I need to draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So, the structure would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH₃)₂? Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pentane is five carbons, double bond between 1 and 2. The third carbon has a methyl group attached.

Wait, so the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH2? No, wait, let me get that right. Let's number the pent-1-ene as:

1       2       3       4     5
CH₂=CH–CH–CH₂–CH3. Wait, but that's not right because pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so a methyl group is on carbon 3. So, that would make it: CH₂=CH–CH(CH3)–CH₂–CH3? Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the structure as CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me think: pentane has five carbons. 1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2
