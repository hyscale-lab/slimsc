Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question involves three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) discovered using the TTV method. That's the transit timing variation method, I remember. So, the TTV method relies on the changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it's perturbed by other nearby planets. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just context.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Specifically, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Temp1/Temp2 = 1.4 and Temp2/Temp3 = 2.3. Oh wait, or is it Temp1/Temp2? Let me check the question again. Oh, the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So Temp1/Temp2 = 1.4, which means Temp1 is higher than Temp2.

Similarly, the mass ratios are given: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, mass1/mass2 = 1.15, and mass2/mass3 = 1.35. So mass1 is a bit larger than mass2, which is larger than mass3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. The options are A to D, but I need to calculate it.

The problem states that the albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects the amount of light reflected, so that's a factor in equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but since all three have the same albedo (0.3), that term can be factored out when taking ratios. So for the temperature ratios, it's mainly about the inverse square of the distance and the star's luminosity. But wait, we don't know if all the planets orbit the same star. Oh, the problem says it's a system of three exoplanets, so yes, same star. So L is the same for all three.

So the equilibrium temperature formula simplifies for each planet as T ∝ sqrt(L) / D^(1/2), but actually, let me get the exact formula right.

The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D^2) ]^(1/4 )

Since L, a, and σ are constants for the system, the ratio between the temperatures of two planets (say, Planet1 and Planet2) would be:

T1 / T2 = [ (D2 / D1 ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, wait, because D is
