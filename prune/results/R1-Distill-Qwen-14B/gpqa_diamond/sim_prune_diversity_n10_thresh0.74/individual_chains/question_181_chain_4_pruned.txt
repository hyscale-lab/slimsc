Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux question. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I know that the Sun's energy production is mainly through the proton-proton chain, and the pp-III branch is a part of that. Wait, what's the pp-III branch exactly? Oh right, in the proton-proton chain, the main branch (pp-I) produces a helium-4 nucleus, and there's another branch (pp-II) that produces boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 and two positrons. But the question is specifically about the pp-III branch stopping.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought the proton-proton chain has two main branches: pp-I and pp-II. Maybe pp-III is another, less common branch? Or perhaps it's a typo and they mean pp-I? No, the note says it's definitely pp-III. Well, regardless, I'll proceed with that.

So, the pp-III branch produces some neutrinos. If it stops, the neutrino production from that branch would stop as well. But what neutrinos are we talking about here? Solar neutrinos come from different reactions. The main ones are the pep reaction (which is part of pp-I), the boron-8 decay (pp-II), and others like the carbon-nitrogen cycle, but I think the latter is more dominant in hotter stars, not the Sun.

Wait, the Sun is mostly using the proton-proton chain. The main pp-I process produces helium and emits neutrinos via the decay of the intermediate boron-8. So if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the neutrino production is affected?

I remember that the pp-III branch involves the capture of protons on carbon-12. Oh, wait, that's part of the CNO cycle. Or is that part of the proton-proton chain? Maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think: the CNO cycle is a different hydrogen burning process, more efficient at higher temperatures. But the Sun's core is mostly doing the proton-proton chain, especially in the main sequence phase.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain that produces a specific neutrino emission. So, when it stops, the neutrinos from that branch stop. But which neutrino energies are affected?

The question is about two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio of their fluxes is what we're looking for. Before the pp-III branch stopped, all the neutrinos were being produced as usual. But now, for the last 8.5 minutes, the branch has been stopped. So, the neutrinos from this process aren't reaching us anymore.

Wait, neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, so neutrinos emitted 8.5 minutes ago would have arrived here about 8.5 minutes laterâ€”so if the branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would stop arriving starting from about 8.5 minutes ago. So, the neutrinos we detect now are from the time before the branch stopped, and any neutrinos emitted after the stop haven't arrived yet.

So, the neutrinos we receive
