Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about space travel and time dilation, right? I've heard about that in my classes. So, the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is super fast, moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. But wait, the question is from their perspective, so I need to calculate how long the trip will take for them.

Wait, so the astronaut's own experienced time is what matters. Because when you're moving at such a high speed, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is that effect where time moves slower for the person traveling at high speeds relative to another observer. So from Earth's frame of reference, the trip would take longer, but from the astronaut's perspective, less time passes.

But how do I calculate this? I think I need to use the concept of Lorentz factor, gamma. Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, v is the velocity of the spacecraft, and c is the speed of light.

Let me plug in the numbers. The velocity given is 0.99999987c. So v is almost the speed of light. Let me compute v squared over c squared. Since v is 0.99999987c, v squared is (0.99999987)^2 * c². So when I divide by c squared, it becomes (0.99999987)^2.

Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 squared. Hmm, 0.99999987 is almost 1. So squaring it, I think it'll be approximately (1 - 1.3e-7) squared. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 minus 0.00000013, right? So squaring that would be (1 - 2*0.00000013) approximately, using the binomial approximation. So that's about 1 - 0.00000026. So 0.99999974?

Wait, but I might not need to be that precise. Let's just compute it numerically. Let me think: 0.99999987 is 0.99999987. So squaring that. Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Alternatively, considering that 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a². a is 1.3e-7, so a squared is negligible. So 1 - 2a would be 1 - 2.6e-7, which is 0.99999974. So v^2/c^2 is approximately 0.99999974.

So 1
