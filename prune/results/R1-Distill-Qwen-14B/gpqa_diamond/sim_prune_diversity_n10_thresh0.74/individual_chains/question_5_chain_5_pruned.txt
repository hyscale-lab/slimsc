Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and operators. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. Okay, so I remember that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are associated with operators, and they represent the possible outcomes and states when a measurement is made.

First, the components of the operator P are given: Px, Py, and Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write those down.

Px is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Py is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Pz is (ħ/2) multiplied by:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

So the operator P along direction n is a combination of these components. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. 

The general form of a spin operator along an arbitrary direction is P = P · n. So substituting, that would be P = (P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ). Because the Y-component of n is zero, Py doesn't contribute here. So P is a combination of Px and Pz, scaled by sinθ and cosθ respectively.

Let me write that out. So,

P = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] + cosθ * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Multiplying each term:

First term (from Px): sinθ * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] → [ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ]
Second term (from Pz): cosθ * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ] → [ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding these together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix for P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
           [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because when you multiply (ħ/2) with the sum of the matrices, each element gets multiplied by (ħ/2). So the matrix elements are:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ],
           [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. The first term after adding gives [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]? Hmm, let's see:

Wait, the first element after adding is cosθ (from Pz) in [1,1], and the [2,2] is -cosθ. The [1,2] and [2,1] elements are sinθ each. So yes, that's correct.

So, the operator P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So M = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
                                             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the way I wrote it earlier, M is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So the matrix operator P is M.

So the eigenvalue equation is M |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩.

Since |v⟩ is an eigenvector, this equation must hold. Let's write the matrix equation.

M is (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
               [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |v⟩ = (ħ/2) |v⟩

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |v⟩ = |v⟩

So the matrix equation simplifies to:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [ a; b ] = [ a; b ]

Where [a; b] is the eigenvector.

So let's write the equations:

(1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
(2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me subtract equation (1) from both sides. Wait, equation (1) says cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Similarly, equation (2): sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0.

So we have two equations:

(1) (cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0
(2) sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b = 0

Hmm, so this is a homogeneous system. For a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio a/b from the first equation. Let's try that.

From equation (1):
(cosθ -1 ) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ) ] b

Similarly, equation (2):
sinθ a = (cosθ +1 ) b → a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] b

So both expressions for a in terms of b must be equal.

So:

[ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ]

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1) * sinθ to eliminate denominators:

- sinθ * sinθ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1)

→ - sin²θ = cos²θ -1

But cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ.

So the right-hand side is (cosθ)^2 -1 = - sin²θ.

So left side is - sin²θ. Right side is - sin²θ. So the equality holds.

So the two equations are consistent. Therefore, the ratio a/b is either given by equation (1) or (2).

Let me take equation (1):

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ) ] b

Hmm, let me simplify that expression. Let's factor the denominator:

cosθ - 1 = -(1 - cosθ )

So denominator is -(1 - cosθ )

So:

a = [ - sinθ / ( - (1 - cosθ) ) ] b = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b

Another approach is to note that 1 - cosθ =
