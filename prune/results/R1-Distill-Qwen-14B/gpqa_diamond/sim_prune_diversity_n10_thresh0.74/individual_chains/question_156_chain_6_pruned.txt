Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, their products are combined and run through two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about what peaks they would observe in each case.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions, especially in epoxidizing alkenes. So, both reactions are probably epoxidations.

Wait, but wait. When alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For (E) and (Z) isomers, the reaction conditions might lead to different diastereomers.

But wait, how does the geometry of the starting alkene influence the epoxide? Let me think. The epoxidation of an alkene typically proceeds through a concerted mechanism, where the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

In the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Epoxidation forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are added across the double bond. The addition is such that the peracid's oxygen adds in a way that the resulting epoxide has adjacent stereocenters. For an (E) alkene, the epoxide formed would have the two oxygen-bearing carbons in a trans arrangement, I think. Because in (E) configuration, the substituents are opposite, so adding the oxygen from the same face (like a cis addition) can't happen. Wait, no, actually, peracid additions are electrocyclic in some ways, but perhaps the stereochemistry is preserved.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether the epoxidation leads to cis or trans epoxide. Oh, wait, I think that for mCPBA, which is a peracid, the epoxidation tends to proceed with a cis addition. Because the peracid approaches the same face (end-on approach), so the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to a cis epoxide.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. When a peracid reacts with an alkene, the reaction is an electrocyclic opening, where the peracid's O-O bond breaks, and each oxygen attaches to each end of the alkene. The mechanism is a
