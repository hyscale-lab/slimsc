Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so adding the same volume of water would dilute it by half, right? Because the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the initial concentration of acetic acid would change. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated using Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because 0.05 M times 0.02 L gives 0.001 moles, and when you add another 0.02 L, total is 0.04 L. So 0.001/0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is between acetic acid and NaOH. The neutralization reaction would be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added would be equal to the moles of acetic acid present. So let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles, as calculated before. The NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. The volume of NaOH would be moles / concentration =
