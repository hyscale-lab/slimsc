Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The situation: There's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, and they sequenced the mutants. The changes are in the first exon. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, so the compound isn't made anymore. Since it's a gene, disrupting it could stop the production of the compound. But how do the mutations affect this?

Looking at the options, I need to compare each mutant's DNA sequence to the intact gene and see which one has a mutation that would likely cause a nonfunctional protein.

The intact gene is given as:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Each mutant has a different change. Let me look at each mutant one by one.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part. The intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT... and Mutant 1 is ATG TTC TAC GCT. Wait, so the second codon in the intact is TTT, which is Phe. In Mutant 1, it's TTC, which is still Phe? No, wait, TTT is Phe, and TTC is also Phe because the third base varies. Wait, no, the first two bases are TT. The third base is the wobble position. So both codons TTT and TTC code for Phe. So that's a silent mutation. But wait, looking further, the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leu), and in Mutant 1, it's TAC. Wait, let me parse that.

Wait, let's line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TTA TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTA TTA TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused because the initial part is maybe longer. Let me count the letters.

Intact: The first few bases are ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Wait, perhaps the first part where the change occurs is around the third codon.

Wait, the first part of the gene is ATG (start), then TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGG ATG...

So, the first codon is ATG (same), second codon is TTC (which is Phe, same as TTT in the wild type). Third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), but in mutant1, it's TAC. Wait, TAC codes for Tyr. So the third amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. So the protein would have a different amino acid there. But would that disrupt the function? Maybe, but perhaps not completely. It could cause a change, but not necessarily a complete loss of function.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact:

Wild type: ...CTCGCTGGT...

Mutant2: ...
