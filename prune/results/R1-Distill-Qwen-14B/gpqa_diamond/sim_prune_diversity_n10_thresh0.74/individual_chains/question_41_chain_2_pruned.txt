Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, right, I remember that when objects move relative to each other, you have to consider things like relativity, but wait, is this a relativity problem or more about the properties of the medium?

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. So the glass is moving towards us, and the light inside it is also moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. Wait, so the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But when the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

I'm a bit stuck here. I think about relative velocity. Normally, when you have an object moving at velocity v, and something inside it moving at u relative to it, the velocity relative to the lab is u + v. But wait, that's only when velocities are much smaller than the speed of light, right? But in this case, light is involved, which is moving at a significant fraction of c, so maybe I can't just add them directly.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n. So when the medium is moving, does the overall speed of the light change according to the medium's motion? Or is the speed of light in the medium always c/n regardless of the medium's motion?

Oh, right, in classical mechanics, when the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium would change. But according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c regardless of the source's motion. But in a medium, the speed is c/n, and the medium's motion might affect the observed speed. Wait, but this is getting tricky.

Wait, maybe I should consider the frame of the lab and the frame of the glass. Let me think. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. Now, from the lab's perspective, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the observer),
