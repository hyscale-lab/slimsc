Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack.

First, let's break down the structure. A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring suggests that there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total carbon count is 8, so the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus two substituents. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so the ring itself is 6 carbons. The substituent(s) must account for the remaining 2 carbons. Oh wait, no, wait: the compound has 8 carbons in total. So 6 from the ring, so the substituents add 2 carbons. But wait, di-substituted means two substituents. Each substituent must be a single group. So each substituent has 1 carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, wait. No, the substituents can't be on the ring, so perhaps each substituent is a single group. Let's think.

Wait, the substituents on the ring would each add some carbons. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group (adds 1 C), and another is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which would be a carbonyl attached to the ring), but wait, the carbonyl is part of the substituent, but maybe the substituent is a group like OCH3 or something else.

Wait, but the IR data indicates a carbonyl group. So one substituent is a carbonyl. Then, another substituent is a halogen because FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So that substituent is an aromatic halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

So, the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone), and the other is a halogen.

Wait, no,
