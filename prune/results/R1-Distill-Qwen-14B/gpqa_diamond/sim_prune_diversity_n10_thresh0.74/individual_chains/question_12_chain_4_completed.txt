Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The Pi(+) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I think this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about the conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy goes into the rest energy of the muon plus the kinetic energies of both particles, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, I think. Wait, neutrinos are super light, maybe even massless for this purpose. So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, I guess.

Wait, but wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, which is a significant part of the pion's mass. So the pion is heavier than the muon, so there's enough mass to allow decay, which it is.

So, let's model this.

Let me denote the energies and momenta.

Let me denote:
- The pion is at rest, so its energy is m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV. Its momentum is zero.
- After decay, the muon has energy E_mu and momentum p_mu.
- The neutrino has energy E_nu and momentum p_nu.

Since momentum must be conserved, the vector sum of the momenta must be zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum magnitude is scalar, perhaps |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But wait, direction matters, but since they're opposite, their magnitudes are equal.

So the magnitudes are equal: p_mu = p_nu = p.

Now, energy is conserved. So:

m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.

But the energies can be written in terms of their momenta and masses.

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no. Let me think. The energy of a particle is given by E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But since we're working in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c for momentum), the equations simplify.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

Similarly, E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_nu^2 )

But wait, neutrinos are super light, so m_nu is approximately zero. So E_nu ≈ p, because sqrt(p^2 + 0) = p.

So putting it all together.

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_nu = p, so E_mu = m_pi - E_nu.

Wait, but E_mu is also sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). So substituting:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = m_pi - p

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2
p^2 + m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

So p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )

Let me compute that.

m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So m_pi^2 is (139.6)^2 ≈ let me calculate that:

139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6 = Let me compute 140^2 is 19600, but subtract 0.4*2*140 and add 0.4^2.

Wait, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488. So 19488.16.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that.

105.7 * 105.7.

(100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6 )

Compute denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2

So p ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute.

279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 29.8 is 279.2 * 29.8? Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Approximating:

Let me try 29.8: 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2*0.2=55.84, so 8376-55.84=8320.16.

Hmm, 8315.67 is a bit less than that. So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So perhaps 29.8 - (4.49)/(279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So p≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm getting p as approximately 29.784 MeV/c. So E_nu is approximately p, which is 29.784 MeV.

But wait, the options don't have a neutrino KE of around 29.8 MeV. Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the second number is 29.8 MeV, which matches.

But wait, the question is about the kinetic energies, not the total energy. So for the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) and its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu.

Similarly, the neutrino's kinetic energy is E_nu - m_nu. But since m_nu is negligible, KE_nu ≈ E_nu ≈ p.

So let's compute E_mu.

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

p is approx 29.784, m_mu is 105.7.

So 29.784^2 is about 887 (since 30^2=900, so 29.784^2 ≈ 887).

m_mu^2 is 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So sqrt(887 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 is approx 12056, which is close to 12059. So E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Kinetic energy for muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Which matches the first number in option D, which is 4.12 MeV. So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

But wait, let me verify more precisely.

Wait, let me compute p more accurately.

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 = 139.6 *139.6.

Compute 139 *139: 139^2 = (140-1)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*1 +1 = 19600 - 280 +1 = 19321.

Then 0.6^2 =0.36, and cross terms: 2*139*0.6 = 166.8.

So (139 +0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 +166.8 +0.36= 19488.16.

m_mu^2=105.7^2: let me compute it accurately.

100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140.

So 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49.

So m_pi² - m_mu² =19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

p=8315.67/(2*139.6) = 8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 *29.8 = ?

279.2 *29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2= 8376-279.2=8096.8

Then 279.2 *0.8=223.36 → 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.

But numerator is 8315.67. So 8320.16 is 4.49 more than 8315.67.

So the exact value is 29.8 - (4.49/279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784^2: 29.784 *29.784.

Let me compute 30^2=900, but 29.784 is 30-0.216.

So (30 -0.216)^2 = 30² - 2*30*0.216 + (0.216)^2 =900 -12.96 +0.046656= 887.086656.

So E_mu = sqrt(887.086656 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.576656).

What's the square root of 12059.576656?

Let me see: 109.8^2 =119.8 *109.8? Wait, 109^2=11881. 110^2=12100. So 12059 is between 109^2 and 110^2.

109^2=11881, 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2=109^2 + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2=11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04.

Hmm, 109.8^2=12056.04. Our E_mu^2 is 12059.58.

So 12059.58 -12056.04=3.54.

So the difference is 3.54, so E_mu is approximately 109.8 + 3.54/(2*109.8) → 109.8 + 3.54/(219.6) → 109.8 + ~0.0161 → approx 109.816 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.816 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV ≈4.12 MeV.

Which matches option D's first value. The neutrino's KE is E_nu, which is p=29.784 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV as in option D.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (Pi⁺) is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) must also sum to zero, meaning their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: **|p_μ| = |p_ν| = p**.

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
**E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.**  
After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
**E_initial = E_μ + E_ν.**

The energy of the muon is given by:  
**E_μ = √(p² + m_μ²),**  
where **m_μ = 105.7 MeV** is the rest mass of the muon.  
The energy of the neutrino is approximately equal to its momentum (since its rest mass is negligible):  
**E_ν ≈ p.**

Substituting these into the energy conservation equation:  
**139.6 = √(p² + 105.7²) + p.**

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:  
**139.6² = (√(p² + 105.7²) + p)².**  
Expanding and simplifying:  
**139.6² = p² + 105.7² + 2p√(p² + 105.7²).**

Rearranging terms and solving for **p**, we find:  
**p = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6).**

Calculating numerically:  
- **139.6² = 19488.16 MeV²**,  
- **105.7² = 11172.49 MeV²**,  
- **139.6² - 105.7² = 8315.67 MeV²**,  
- **p = 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.**

The neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately equal to its momentum:  
**KE_ν ≈ p ≈ 29.8 MeV.**

For the muon, its total energy is:  
**E_μ = √(p² + m_μ²) = √(29.784² + 105.7²) ≈ 109.8 MeV.**  
Its kinetic energy is:  
**KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ = 109.8 - 105.7 ≈ 4.1 MeV.**

Thus, the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
