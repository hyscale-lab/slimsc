Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the problem says we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful about the units.

Wait, neutralization reactions usually involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released per mole of H+ ions reacting with OH- ions. But wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is often considered as around -57 kJ/mol, but that's for monoprotic acids and bases. Here, we have different concentrations and volumes, so I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions and see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from each acid. HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too but it's diprotic (each molecule can donate two H+ ions). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So the OH- comes from the base.

Wait, so the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. Let's compute each.

For HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each HCl gives 1 H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: Molarity 0.3 M, Volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles =
