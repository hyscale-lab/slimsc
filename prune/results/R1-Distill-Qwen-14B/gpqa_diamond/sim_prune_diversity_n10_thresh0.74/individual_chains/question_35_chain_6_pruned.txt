Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix representing the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. 

First, let me read the problem again. The operator A_y is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So the matrix Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by this S matrix. 

Wait, the problem says Ay = c·S. So c is h/(4π), right? So Ay is (h/(4π)) times S. Hmm.

I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are involved. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, and they have specific properties. Let me recall them. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is the same as the matrix given for S here. Because S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] which looks like the standard form of σy. 

Wait, what's the standard σy matrix? Oh right, σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so yes, S is σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin angular momentum operator is usually given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Wait, let's think: the standard spin matrices are S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i. Because for spin 1/2, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for example, S_y would be (ħ/2) σy. 

But in this problem, Ay is given as c·S, where c = h/(4π) and S is σy. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Let's compute that. 

Wait, h is Planck's constant. But ħ is h/(2π), right? So h = 2π ħ. So substituting, c = (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. 

Wait, that makes Ay = (ħ/2) σy. Which is exactly the same as the standard S_y operator, since S_y is (ħ/2) σy. So this operator Ay is the same as the spin angular momentum in the y-direction. 

So the eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± ħ/2, but wait, wait: because Ay is (ħ/2) σy, and σy has eigenvalues ±1, so Ay's eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(±1) = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. 

Now, looking at the options, the options are giving different possible eigenvalues. Let me look
