Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm. The question is about pion decay, I think. Let me try to remember what I know about this.

Okay, the reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is the neutrino, right? So it's a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. And the pion is initially at rest. I need to find the kinetic energy of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino.

The rest masses given are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. So I guess the neutrino's rest mass is negligible. Because neutrinos are super light, right? So I can probably treat it as massless for this problem.

Wait, but wait. Neutrinos do have mass, but in many problems, especially at this level, they are considered to have zero rest mass. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Now, the total energy in the system is the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. And the muon and neutrino will share this energy.

Wait, but the muon has a rest mass, so its energy will be
