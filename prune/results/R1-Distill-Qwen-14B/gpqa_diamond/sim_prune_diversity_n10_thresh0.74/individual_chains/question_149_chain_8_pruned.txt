Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so it's like each peak is about 0.5H. Hmm, but since integrals add up, maybe it's not a splitting issue like coupling because the question says coupling can be ruled out.

Wait, the coupling pattern isn't spin-spin, so maybe it's something else causing the split. But wait, the question says that based on the coupling pattern, spin-spin is ruled out. So it's not J-coupling between protons. So why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Looking at the options, the possible reasons might be some kind of isomerism. Enantiomers or diastereomers? Or maybe it's a side product or something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests two components of the same mass. So, if the mass is the same, they can't be different compounds. So they must be isomers with the same molecular weight.

So what are possibilities for same mass? Enantiomers have same mass, same molecular formula. Diastereomers also same mass but different physical properties. So both enantiomers and diastereomers would show same mass. But in the NMR, how would that look?

In NMR, enantiomers would have the same spectrum if they're in a chiral environment that's the same for each. Wait, but if the environment is chiral, maybe in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer would have the same NMR because it's a racemic mix. Wait, no. No, in a racemic mixture, each enantiomer's NMR would be the same only if the environment is achiral. If the environment is chiral, then the NMR spectra would be different. Hmm, but the question says the NMR is consistent except for the two peaks.

Wait, but the NMR peaks for the same proton. So if the molecule has a chiral center, maybe the alpha protons are split due to diastereotopicity or something else. Or perhaps they're diastereomers.

Wait, in a racemic mix (enantiomers), if the compound has multiple chiral centers, the NMR might show some splitting if the environment leads to different shifts. But in a racemic mixture, for a proton that's in a symmetric environment, perhaps it wouldn't split. Or maybe in this case, the alpha protons are affected.

Alternatively, if the compound has a double bond, and there's some conformational issue, maybe axial and equatorial protons, but that's more about diastereomers than enantiomers.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same as expected. So the peaks must be same mass as the product. A precursor would have a higher mass, perhaps. So probably not.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. So racemic mix. But in that case, the NMR would show same pattern because each enantiomer is the same in solution when dissolved in a chiral solvent, but wait, no. If the environment is chiral, like in a chiral column, but the question is about the NMR spectrum, which is run in a solution. So in a racemic mix, the NMR would show the same as a pure sample because each enantiomer contributes the same peaks. Unless the sample is enriched in one enantiomer, but here they are a 50:50 mix, so the NMR would look the same. So why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, maybe if the molecule has another stereocenter, making it a diastereomer mix. But if it's a racemic mixture, the diastereomers would be different. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that is, but perhaps it refers to some kind of coupling where two bonds form, leading to impurities. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for these two peaks. And the peaks have the same shift, so maybe not due to coupling.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, you'd get different shifts. But if two diastereomers have the same shift for a particular proton, maybe due to symmetry or something. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts, so maybe they're diastereomers with that proton in a similar environment.

Wait, but if the compound is a diastereomer mix, the NMR would show different shifts for other protons, right? But the question says the NMR is mostly consistent except for two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So that suggests that other protons are unchanged. So perhaps only one proton is split into two, others not. How?

Wait, let's think again. The NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. The integral adds up to
