Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some factors next to it. The factors are alpha cubed times g squared times sqrt(2), times 8, divided by (4 pi)^6, multiplied by (Q/M)^2. And we need to find out how many loops the diagram has.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically contributes a factor that depends on the number of loops. For example, a one-loop diagram would have a certain structure in its amplitude, and higher loops add more.

Let me think about the general structure of Feynman diagrams and their contributions. The amplitude of a Feynman diagram often includes factors from integrals over loop momenta, which are typically logarithmic divergences or something else depending on the theory. But for the purpose of counting loops, maybe the superficial degree of divergence or the structure of the amplitude factors can help.

Wait, another approach: In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the number of loops can be determined by the expansion in terms of the fine-structure constant alpha. For example, a tree-level diagram (no loops) is O(alpha^0), a one-loop diagram is O(alpha^1), two loops O(alpha^2), etc. But wait, that's not exactly true because higher-order processes can have more insertions of the coupling constants. Oh wait, no, the overall
