Okay, so I've got this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the mass dimension is about the units of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over four dimensions (which has dimension 4) means each term in the Lagrangian density must have [L] = 4.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the dimension of κ.

Let me break down each part. The ψ is a spinor field, which I think has mass dimension 3/2. Because fermions like electrons have dimension 3/2 in four spacetime dimensions. So ψ has [ψ] = 3/2, and ψ̄ is the same, so ψ̄ ψ would have [ψ̄][ψ] = 3.

Then σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ_{μν} itself doesn't add any mass dimension. So when we have ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, that's like ψ̄ ψ multiplied by σ, which is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3.

Now F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field strength F is the derivative of A, so each derivative adds dimension 1. F has two derivatives, probably, because F_{mu nu} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So [F] would be [∂][A] = 1 * 1 = 1. So F has dimension 1.

Putting it all together: L_int has terms κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions would be [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. The Lagrangian is a product of these terms, so the dimensions add.

Wait, no, each term is a product. So the dimension of L_int is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F^{mu nu}].

Wait, no. Wait, the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F^{mu nu}, so all these are multiplied together. So the dimensions should sum up as follows:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ_{μν}] + [F^{mu nu}] = 4.

Wait, but σ is dimensionless. So [σ] is 0. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, so 3/2 +3/2 =3. F has dimension 1. So let me compute:

[κ
