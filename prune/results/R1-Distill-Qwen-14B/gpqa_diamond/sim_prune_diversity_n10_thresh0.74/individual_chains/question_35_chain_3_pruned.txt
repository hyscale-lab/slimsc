Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It says that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, denoted as Ay, which satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I can write this matrix S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Then, Ay is c times this matrix S. So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Let's start by recalling some concepts. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0, where λ are the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.

So first, I should compute the matrix Ay. Let me compute that.

c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. Let's compute each element:

First row: (0 * c, (-i) * c)
Second row: (i * c, 0 * c )

So Ay looks like:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. To find eigenvalues, I'll set up the equation:

det(Ay - λ I) = 0

That's:

| -λ       (-i h)/(4π)   |
| (i h)/(4π)  -λ        |   = 0

The determinant of this matrix is ( -λ )( -λ ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating each part:

(λ)^2 - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes -(-1) = +1. So,

= λ^2 - [ (1) * (h^2/(4π)^2) ) ]

So the equation becomes:

λ^2 - (h^2)/(16 π²) ) = 0

Solving for λ:

λ^2 = h^2/(16 π²)
=> λ = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π). Hmm. Wait, but I thought the eigenvalues of S would be ± something, and then multiplied by c. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the eigenvalues of S first, and then multiplied by c. Let me see.

What is the matrix S?

S is [ [0, -i],
        [i, 0] ]

The eigenvalues of S can be found the same way. Let's compute them.

The characteristic equation for S is det(S - μ I) = 0.

So,

| -μ      -i       |
| i       -μ      | = 0

Determinant is μ^2 - (i * (-i)) ) = μ^2 - ( (-i^2) ) = μ^2 - (1) = 0. Because i*(-i) is -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So μ^2 = 1, so μ = ±1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Then, since Ay is c multiplied by S, the eigenvalues of Ay will be c times the eigenvalues of S. So c = h/(4π), so eigenvalues are c * 1 and c * (-1), which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, which doesn't match. Option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1, which I don't think is right. Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is a real number. So the eigenvalues are purely real, because h/(4π) is real, so a is real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have an
