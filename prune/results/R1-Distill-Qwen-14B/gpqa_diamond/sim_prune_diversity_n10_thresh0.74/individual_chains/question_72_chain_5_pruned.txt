Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, let me take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and going through several steps to form a final product, and then I need to determine how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in that product. 

First, let me parse the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure, right? So the structure is a bicyclic compound with two rings, and the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. Norbornene is a bicyclic structure where two rings are bridged, and in this case, the substituent is on the bridgehead carbon (position 7), which is the bridge between the two rings.

Next, the first reaction: this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, so what's 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene? It's a cyclohexadiene with two methyl groups attached at carbons 5 and 6, each bearing a bromine. So each methyl has two Br atoms? Wait, no, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), meaning each methyl group on C5 and C6 has two bromines. So each methyl is CBr2CH2 groups attached at C5 and C6 of the cyclohexadiene.

Sodium iodide (NaI) is a good source of iodide ions, which are nucleophiles. When reacting with dibromomethyl groups, I think an elimination might occur. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution. Wait, but the starting material has a diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), which is a conjugated diene. So maybe a Diels-Alder reaction is happening here.

Wait a second, because the starting material is a diene, and the other compound is a dienophile. Oh wait, no, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,
