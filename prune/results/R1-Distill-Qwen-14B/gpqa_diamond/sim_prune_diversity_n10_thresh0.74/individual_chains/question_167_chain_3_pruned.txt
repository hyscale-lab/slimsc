Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are like those that can't be described by Gaussian distributions, such as Fock states or cat states.

The question gives me a specific state, the Schrödinger cat state. The state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha squared)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, so non-Gaussianity is often measured by how different the state is from a Gaussian state. The relative entropy here might be comparing the entropy of the state to that of the closest Gaussian state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach.

First, I think I should find the density matrix rho for the given state. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition isn't, hence the non-Gaussian state.

The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me compute N for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Compute sin(2phi): 2phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(...) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

Then N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4) |0.5> + sin(-pi/4) |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the coefficients are 0.7071 and -0.7071. Dividing by N (≈0.6275) gives each coefficient as about 0.7071/0.6275 ≈1.126 and similarly for the other term.

But wait, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So rho will be (1/N²) times [ cos(phi)|alpha><alpha| + sin(phi)|-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha|) ].

But the reference Gaussian state tau is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, I think. Or perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense. I'm not entirely sure about that part.

Wait, the relative entropy measure given is del_b = [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]. Oh, wait, no, the formula is del_b = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). Because typically, the relative entropy between two states rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But here, the formula is given as trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln
