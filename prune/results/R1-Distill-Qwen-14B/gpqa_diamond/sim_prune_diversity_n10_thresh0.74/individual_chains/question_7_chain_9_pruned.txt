Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that high-energy gamma-rays annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γγ → e+ e-. The task is to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average CMB photon energy is given as 10^-3 eV.

Wait, I remember that when particles interact, their interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target particles. In this case, the target is the CMB photons, which are everywhere. So the gamma-ray's lifetime would be determined by the inverse of the interaction rate. If the interaction rate is high enough, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, limiting its effective lifetime.

I think the process is similar to the pair production by high-energy photons in the CMB. Oh right, the photon-photon interaction cross-section for producing electron-positron pairs. The cross-section for this process must depend on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon.

The cross-section formula I vaguely remember is something like σ ≈ (σ_0) * (E_cm^2) / (m_e^2 c^4), where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But wait, I might be mixing up different processes. Alternatively, the cross-section might depend on the product of the photon energies.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+e- is a threshold process. The center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So if the gamma-ray and CMB photon combine to have a center-of-mass energy above this threshold, the process can happen.

But in this case, the CMB photon is low energy, so the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy to meet the threshold when combined with the CMB photon. So I think the condition is that the gamma-ray energy E is such that when it interacts with a CMB photon of energy E_cm ~ 2E_photon (I might be getting the relation wrong here).

Wait, the CMB photon's average energy is 1e-3 eV. So the gamma-ray has to have enough energy so that when it interacts with the CMB photon, the combined
