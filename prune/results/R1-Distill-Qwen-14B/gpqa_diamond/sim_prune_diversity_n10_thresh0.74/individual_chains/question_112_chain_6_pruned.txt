Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, those are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. 

The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me visualize that. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonals would be zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So, the matrix looks like:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]], so when you multiply by hbar/2, you get this structure.

So, the operator in question is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the eigenstates for this operator as well. Since the operator is a scaled version of X, their eigenstates will be the same.

What are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix? They are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The eigenstates can be expressed as:
|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be written in terms of these eigenstates, and the coefficients will determine the probabilities.

But wait, our state |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, so we need to express it in terms of |+x> and |-x> to find the probabilities.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should normalize |alpha> since the question says it's proportional to that vector. So, the first step is to normalize the state.

The state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The norm is the inner product of the state with itself. So, |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

|1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because (1+i)(1-i)=1 +1=2.

|2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/√7 ] |down>.

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |-x> states.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Substituting the expressions for |+x> and |-x>,

|alpha> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/sqrt(2) ] |down>.

Comparing this with our |alpha>,

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_-) / sqrt(2) ]
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ - c_-) / sqrt(2) ]

So, we have two equations:

1. (c_+ + c_-) = sqrt(2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
2. (c_+ - c_-) = sqrt(2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Let me solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations 1 and 2:
2 c_+ = (1+i) sqrt(2/7) + (2 -i) sqrt(2/7)
= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
=> c_+ = 3/2 * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:
2 c_- = (1+i) sqrt(2/7) - (2 -i) sqrt(2/7)
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= [ -1 + 2i ] * sqrt(2/7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7)
=> c_- = [ (-1 + 2i ) sqrt(2/7) ] / 2
= (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/ (2 sqrt(7))
= (-1 +2i) * sqrt(2/(7*4)) )= ?

Wait, perhaps I should square the magnitudes to find the probabilities.

The probability of measuring |+x> is |c_+|^2 and |-x> is |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)) as I found earlier.

So |c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_-|^2 = | (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) |^2

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

c_- = [ (-1 +
