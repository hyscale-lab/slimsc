Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly good, except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half the expected. Wait, but the integral is for the same proton, right? So maybe they're splitting each other or something else is causing this.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Because if it were coupling to another proton, you'd see a splitting, but since they ruled that out, maybe it's another kind of splitting. Or maybe it's not due to coupling at all.

The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass implies same molecular weight. But why two peaks then? Maybe it's a diastereomer or an enantiomer. Because enantiomers have the same mass but are different in configuration, so they would elute at different times but have the same mass spec.

Wait, what about the NMR part. Why would there be two peaks for the same proton? If the molecule isn't chiral, you wouldn't expect that. But if it's a racemic mixture, the two enantiomers would make the same NMR because they're mirror images. But wait, if they're enantiomers, wouldn't the alpha-proton environment be the same for each enantiomer? So their NMR would look identical, right? But in the question, the NMR shows two peaks. So that doesn't fit with enantiomer mix. Because enantiomers usually don't split each other's peaks in NMR. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a diastereomer mixture. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would be different. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, but the integral sums to 1H. So perhaps each is a diastereomer with the same alpha proton, but in different environments? No, that doesn't make much sense because diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. But then the two peaks would have different shifts, which the question says they are similar. Also, the mass spec is the same, which fits with diastereomers if they have the same molecular formula. But if the structure is different, like different stereochemistry, but same molecular weight, then diastereomers would produce different retention times but same mass. So the LC-MS would show two peaks because of that.

Wait, but the NMR has two peaks with the same integral. If it's a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have their own set of peaks. But if the alpha proton is in a different environment in each, then you'd
