Okay, so I have this physics problem about the potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The problem says: a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in such systems... Oh right, when you bring charges together, the potential energy is the work done against the electric field. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might affect how the charge redistributes.

Grounding a conductor means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. But wait, the conducting sphere is already neutral unless a charge is placed near it. Since the charge q is placed near it, induced charges will appear on the sphere.

When a charge q is outside a conducting sphere, it induces opposite charges on the outer surface. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced negative charges (if q is positive) will flow away, leaving the sphere with induced positive charges? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, when you bring a positive charge near a grounded sphere, electrons from the Earth (ground) would move onto the sphere to the side of the charge, creating a negative induced charge on the near side and positive on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can't build up; the excess charges would leave the sphere, so the sphere ends up with a net charge?

Wait, no, wait. The grounding allows charges to flow in or out. So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's electrons will redistribute. If q is positive, it attracts electrons toward the near side. But because the sphere is a conductor, the electrons can move freely. However, since the sphere is grounded, any excess electrons would leave the sphere. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of image charges. In the method of images, when you have a charge near a conducting sphere, you can model it as the actual charge and an image charge inside the sphere. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the image charge approach might not directly apply here because the sphere's potential is zero (due to grounding).

Alternatively, the potential on the sphere's surface must be the same as the ground, which is zero. So the sphere is an equipotential surface at zero potential. The charge q will create an electric field, and the sphere will adjust its charges such that the potential on the sphere is zero.

But how does this affect the potential energy of the system? The potential energy is the work done to assemble the system. So, when we bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the center of the sphere, and the sphere, being grounded, adjusts its charges accordingly.

Wait, but the conducting sphere is initially neutral. Then, when placed near charge q, it will have induced charges. However, because it's grounded, the induced negative charges (if q is positive) would flow into the ground, leaving the sphere with a net positive charge. But wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think again.

If q is positive, it induces negative charges on the near side of the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the electrons can leave the sphere, so the sphere's net charge would be zero? No, that can't be right because the induced charges would redistribute, but the sphere would have a dipole moment or something.

Wait, no. The
