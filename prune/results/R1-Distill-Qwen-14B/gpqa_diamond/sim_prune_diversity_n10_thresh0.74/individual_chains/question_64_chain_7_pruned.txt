Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

So, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, which weighs 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, only a mixture of gases is formed. Then, these gases are passed through three tubes without cooling. 

The first tube, number 1, contains anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The second, tube 2, has a Ca(OH)2 solution. Tube 3 has red-hot copper. The results are: tube 1's weight increased by 3.60 g, tube 3's by 0.80 g, and tube 2's weight didn't change. After all that, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes. Let's break it down.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose to form gases. The fact that the mixture is equimolar is important. The gases are passed through the tubes, and each tube reacts with certain gases.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which I know is a strong drying agent. It can absorb moisture, but more importantly, in the presence of certain gases, it might react. Maybe it traps moisture, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it reacts with acidic gases like HCl or NH3?

Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is used in drying tubes for gases like NH3, HCl, etc. So, if the gas mixture has such acids or bases, Mg(ClO4)2 would react with them, increasing the tube's weight. The increase in weight for tube 1 is 3.60 g. So, whatever reacts here is 3.60g.

Tube 2 has Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is a acid (like CO2), it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form calcium carbonate and water. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So that implies that no acidic gas passed through, or the solution couldn't react. So maybe all the acidic gases were already absorbed in tube 1. Alternatively, maybe the gas wasn't an acid.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO formed. I remember that CO can react with hot CuO. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait. CO is a reducing agent, it can reduce CuO. But in this case, the copper is red-hot, so perhaps the gas is a source of oxygen. Or maybe the gas is something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which when passed over hot copper, would react. Wait, wait, no. CO is a reducing agent, and it can reduce CuO to copper, but in that case, the copper would gain mass. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, when CO is passed over hot CuO, it's a reaction: 2 CuO + CO → CO2 + Cu2O. Wait, but the product is Cu2O, which is a mixture of copper oxides. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2, which on reaction with hot copper (in the presence of a catalyst) produces water. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the problem says that CuO is formed. So the reaction in tube 3 probably involves the gas reacting with Cu to form CuO. Let me think: perhaps the gas is H2O vapor? But H2O wouldn't react with red-hot copper unless it's under certain conditions, and I'm not sure that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the gas could be CO. But wait, if the gas is CO, when it's passed over red-hot copper, I think it would cause the copper to lose oxygen. Let me check the reaction. The reaction between CO and CuO is as follows: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2. So, if CO passes through hot CuO, it would reduce it to Cu and produce CO2. But in this case, the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. Let's see: the mass change would be the difference between the products and reactants. 

So, suppose that in tube 3, the gas is CO. The reaction would be:

CO + CuO → Cu + CO2

But wait, no. The CO is the gas entering. Let's think in terms of moles. Let's say 'a' moles of CO react with 'b' moles of CuO.

The reaction is: CO + CuO → Cu + CO2

In this case, each mole of CO reacts with a mole of CuO, producing a mole of Cu and a mole of CO2. The mass change in the tube would be the mass of CuO consumed minus the mass of Cu produced. Because CuO is a solid, and when it reacts, it becomes Cu as a solid.

So, per mole of CuO consumed, the mass change is (64 g/mol - 80 g/mol) = -16 g/mol. So, each mole of CO would cause a loss of 16 g in the tube. But in the problem, the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. That doesn't fit a negative change. Hmm, so maybe this is not the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is hydrogen (H2). Let me think about that. Hydrogen can react with CuO at high temperatures
