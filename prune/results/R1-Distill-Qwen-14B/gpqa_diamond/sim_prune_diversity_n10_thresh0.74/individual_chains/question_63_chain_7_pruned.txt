Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum stuff. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rotation-vibration model. The question is about what happens when a photon is absorbed, causing the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Let me read the question again. The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, fundamental state—oh right, that's the lowest energy state possible for the molecule. So the next state with the lowest energy must be the first excited state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether that's the next rotational state or the next vibrational state. Or maybe both? Oh wait, the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy'. So I think that means the smallest possible energy increase, which would be a transition that requires the least energy. So probably the next allowed state in either rotation or vibration.

Wait, but the options are about momentum. So the photon's momentum is related to its energy. Let me think: the energy of a photon is E = hf, and momentum p = E/c, since p = hf/(c) because E=pc. So if I can find the energy difference between the states, I can find the momentum.

The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no—non-rigid rotor is different, but perhaps in this context, the model includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question mentions the 'fundamental state' and the next state. In vibrational states, the fundamental is n=0, and the next is n=1. For rotational states, the fundamental is usually J=0, and the next is J=1. So the energy difference for each would be different.

But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state—probably the lowest energy state, which would be the vibrational ground state and the rotational ground state (J=0).

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule must transition to the next possible state. But what's the next lowest state? Well, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. The vibrational energy levels have much larger spacing than the rotational ones because vibration involves much higher frequencies. So the energy required for a vibrational transition (e.g., from n=0 to n=1) is much higher than a rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1). Wait, no, actually, the opposite might be true. Wait, the vibrational frequency is higher, so the energy difference per quantum is higher. So a vibrational transition would require a higher energy photon than a rotational one. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest in both vibration and rotation, the next possible state could be either a transition to J=1, or to n=1, whichever requires less energy.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. So I need to find which transition is possible. Wait, but the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest possible energy difference would be to the first allowed state, which is probably the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

Wait, but how does the energy compare between the two transitions? Let me think about the energy levels.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (n + 1/2) h w_vib, where w_vib is the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B (J (J+1)), where B is the rotational constant. Wait, no, more precisely, the rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) J (J+1) ), where I is the moment of inertia.

But the problem gives the angular frequency for vibration, w = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy spacing between n=0 and n=1 is h w. Let me calculate that. h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J*s. So h*w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. That's the energy for a vibrational transition.

Now for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference is E_rot = B [J=1 (1+1) - J=0 (0+1)] = B (2 - 1) = B. So B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length. So let's compute μ first. The masses of X and Y are 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) amu. Let's calculate that: (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh wait, but amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.66 is about 3.0 (approx), so 3e-27 kg. Hmm, but let me do it more accurately: 20 *2 =40, 22 total. 40/22 is 1.81818... amu. So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let's say approximately 1.818 *1.6605 = let's see, 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, so 1.818 *1.6605 ≈ approximately 3.0 (but let me calculate more accurately: 1.818 *1.6605 = (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605) ) = approx 2.9889 + 0.0299 = 3.0188. So about 3.0188e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So I = μ r² = (3.0188e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0188e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Now the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² = (h²)/(4π²). So B = (h²/(4 π² * 2 I )) ) = h²/(8 π² I). Let's compute this. h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

I is 1.2075e-46 kg m². So 8 π² I is 8 * (9.8696) *1.2075e-46 ≈ 8 *9.87 *1.2075e-46 ≈ 8 *11.91e-46 ≈ 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / (9.528e-45) ) = approximately 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that's just B. So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is B*(2 -1) = B ≈4.607e-23 J.

Comparing the two energy differences: vibrational is 2.65e-19 J, rotational is ~4.6e-23 J. The rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait a second, the problem says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps transitions can be a combination of both. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest possible ΔE is the rotational transition.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and ground rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state could be either n=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would be of that lower energy.

So the photon's energy is ΔE = B =4.6e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the rotational energy for J=1 is B*(J=1)(J=1+1) - B*(0)(1) = B*(2
