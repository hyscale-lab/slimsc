Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I'm asked to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

The operator given here is 10σz +5σx. So maybe I can compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

First, let's write down the state. The wavefunction is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. 0.5^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, it's normalized.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy to compute. For any eigenstate, the expectation of the operator is just the eigenvalue.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz|↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So for σz, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So let's compute ⟨σz⟩. The state is a linear combination, so:

⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). 

Calculating each term: 0.5 squared is 0.25. So 0.25 * 1 = 0.25. The other term is (3/4) * (-1) = -0.75. Adding them gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, for σx. Hmm, that's trickier because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I need to find the expectation value of σx for this state.

The expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I can express σx in the σz basis. Let me recall that the Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So σx in the computational basis (|↑⟩, |↓⟩) is [[0,1],[1,0]].

The state ψ is a column vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, let's represent ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Multiplying ψ† σx gives [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, multiply by ψ: [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Calculating each component:

sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4.

0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4.

So sum of these two terms is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = (2 sqrt(3))/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach is to realize that the expectation value of σx is 2 times the probability of measuring x-up minus the probability of x-down. But since σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the expectation value is (P_up - P_down), but wait, no, actually, since the eigenstates of σx are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), which correspond to eigenvalues +1 and -1.

But perhaps it's easier to compute as I did before.

Wait, another way to think: the expectation value is (a* b + b* a), where a and b are the coefficients. Let me see.

Wait, no, when you compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's (a b* + b a*), because σx swaps the basis states.

Wait, let me think again. The state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

Then, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So when you act σx on ψ, you get a|↓⟩ + b|↑⟩.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ | σx |
