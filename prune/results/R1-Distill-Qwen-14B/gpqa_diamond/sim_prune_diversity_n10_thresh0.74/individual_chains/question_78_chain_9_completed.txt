Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're supposed to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r at time t, where t is greater than the time tr when the charge was at some position. The velocity at that time tr is v.

Wait, I remember that potentials are related to the charge and current distributions. Scalar potential comes from charges, and the vector potential is from currents. Oh right, the scalar potential V is given by the charge distribution, and A comes from the current.

The problem is in the context of retarded potentials, I think. Because when you have a moving charge, the fields at a later time depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So the potentials are calculated based on the charge's past position.

The scalar potential V for a moving charge should be similar to that of a static charge, but with some corrections. Wait, but when the charge is moving, do we still use the same Coulomb potential? Or does it change because of motion?

I recall that the scalar potential for a charge in motion isn't just q/(4πε₀ r), because r here would be the distance at the current time. But wait, in the context of retarded potentials, the charge's position is at time tr, which is earlier. So the distance d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d is the displacement vector, and the magnitude would be |d| = sqrt(d · d) = d.

Wait, but the potential is scalar, so it's a function of the distance. So for the scalar potential, the expression would involve the charge q, the direction from the charge to the observation point.

Wait, but in the options, some have terms like (dc - d·v), where d is a vector. Hmm, perhaps that's coming from the Lorentz contraction or the term involving relative motion.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be q/(4πε₀) multiplied by some factor involving the distance. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, in the case of a charge moving at a constant velocity, the scalar potential can be expressed in a way that includes the velocity of the charge. I remember something about the term (1 - (v/c)·r̂), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the general expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential due to a charge distribution is V = (1/4πε₀) ∫ (ρ(r', t_r) / |r - r'|) d³r', where t_r is the retarded time. For a point charge, ρ is just δ³(r' - s(tr)), and s(tr) is the position at time tr. So V would be (q)/(4πε₀) * (1/|r - s(tr)|).

But wait, in the problem, d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). So |d| is the distance. So the scalar potential would be V = q/(4πε₀ |d|).

Wait, but in the options, option B has V as q/(4πε₀ r), which is the Coulomb potential if r is the distance from the origin. But s(tr) isn't necessarily the origin. Wait, no, the origin is the reference frame's origin. So the position of the charge at time tr is s(tr). The vector d is from s(tr) to r, so the distance is |d|, not |r|.

Wait, but the options don't all have |d| in them. Option C and D have terms with d·v. So maybe in the potential expressions, the motion of the charge affects the amplitude.

Wait, but the scalar potential for a moving charge is still (q)/(4πε₀ |d|), just as a static charge, because the scalar potential doesn't depend on the motion of the charge in the static case. Wait, but in reality, the potentials do depend on the motion because of the current. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The scalar potential V is due to the charge itself, regardless of its motion. The vector potential A is due to the current (the movement of the charge). So V is determined by the charge density, and A by the current density.

Wait, but in the case of a point charge, the current is a delta function in space, but extended in time. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's think about the expressions for V and A in the context of retarded potentials. For a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = [q/(4πε₀)] * [1/|r - s(tr)|] * [1 - (v/c)·(r - s(tr))/|r - s(tr)|] 

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential is q/(4πε₀ |d|), where d is the displacement vector from the charge to the point r. And the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v)/(c²) * [1/|d|] (unit vector in direction of d).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B has V as (q)/(4πε₀ r) and A as (v/c²) V. Hmm, what's the reasoning there.

Wait, let's think about the Lorentz gauge. In the Lorenz gauge, the potentials satisfy ∇·A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0. But I'm not sure how that applies here directly.

Alternatively, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge and current densities. The scalar potential is determined by ∇²V = - (ρ/ε₀) and the vector potential by ∇²A = -μ₀ J. But for a point charge, the current is J = q v δ³(...), but I think that's more involved.

Wait, perhaps using the expressions for the potentials in terms of the charge and velocity. I remember that the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v / |d|, where d is the displacement vector. And the scalar potential V is (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|).

So if I have V = q/(4π ε₀ |d|) and A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |d|), then looking at the options:

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Wait, that denominator is (d c - (d · v)).

Hmm, but wait, the denominator is (d c - (d·v)) = c |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in d's direction. Because (d·v) is |d| (v·d̂). So this would be c |d| [1 - (v·d̂)/c ].

Hmm, but I'm not sure if the denominator in the potential expressions would have such a term. Alternatively, maybe that comes from the Lorentz transformation or the time delay.

Alternatively, from the Lienard's result for the fields of an accelerating charge, but perhaps that's more complex than needed here.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are related to the fields via:

E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t,

B = ∇ × A.

In the case of a charge moving with velocity v, the electric field isn't just the Coulomb field because of the motion; there's also a magnetic field due to the current.

But for potentials, the scalar potential is (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|), and the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |d|) multiplied by the unit vector in d's direction.

Looking at the options, option B has V as q/(4πε₀ r) and A as (v/c²) V. So, A = (v/c²) V.

Wait, substituting V from option B into A gives A = [v/(c²)] * [q/(4π ε₀ r)].

But according to my earlier thought, the correct A is (μ₀/(4π ε₀ c²)) q v/(|d|) because μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²). Wait, no, wait, because μ₀ ε₀ c² = 1. So μ₀/(4π) = (1/(ε₀ c²)) * (1/(4π)).

Wait, maybe I should calculate the expressions. Let's see.

The scalar potential V is given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. So V(r, t) = (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|), where |d|= |r - s(tr)|, and d is the vector from s(tr) to r.

The vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v)/(c²) * (d̂)/|d|, where d̂ is the unit vector in d's direction. Because the current is J = q v δ³(r' - s(tr)), and the vector potential from a current is A = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ [J(r') / |r - r'|] d³r'.

So in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), |d| is the distance. So A = (μ₀ q v) / (4π c² |d|) ) * (d/|d|) ) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² |d|²) * d.

Wait, perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, A is (μ₀ q )/(4π c²) * v / |d| * (d/|d|), which is (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² |d|²) * d.

Wait, but looking at the options, the vector potential is expressed as a vector, so A would have direction d.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C has for V, (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - (d·v))), and A as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - (d·v))).

But wait, my earlier conclusion was that V is q/(4πε₀ |d|), so option C's V has a term (qc)/(d c - (d·v)). Wait, the denominator is d c - d·v. Let me write this as c d - (d · v).

Hmm, maybe that comes from the Taylor expansion or considering the time delay due to the motion. Alternatively, perhaps it's from the relativistic expression, considering the time it takes for the field to propagate.

Wait, wait, another approach. The potentials are functions that depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The retarded time tr is such that tr = t - |d|/c, assuming the charge was moving in a straight line, but perhaps more accurately, tr is when the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to r is |d|/c.

So the displacement vector d is (r - s(tr)), and the time tr is such that the light from that position reaches r at time t. So, perhaps the denominator in the potentials includes terms involving the velocity because the charge's position is changing.

Wait, but I'm not directly seeing how that would affect the denominator. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c tr - d·v), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the expression for the scalar potential. It's given by the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. So:

V(r, t) = [q/(4π ε₀)] * [1/|r - s(tr)|].

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π c²)) [ q v(tr) / |r - s(tr)| ].

In these expressions, |r - s(tr)| is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. This distance is |d|, and d is the vector from s(tr) to r.

So in terms of d, V is (q)/(4π ε₀ |d|).

Now, looking at the options, option B has V as (q)/(4π ε₀ r), which would be the case if d were r, but d is the vector from s(tr) to r, which is not the same as r if s(tr) isn't the origin. Wait, but the origin is the reference frame's origin, and s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

Wait, but the position vector r is with respect to the origin. So the vector from s(tr) to r is d = r - s(tr), so |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point. So in the potentials, the denominators involve |d|, not r.

Looking back at the options, option B's V is (q)/(4π ε₀ r), which suggests that d is r, implying s(tr)=0, which isn't necessarily the case. So that can't be right unless the charge is at the origin when it emits the field. But the problem doesn't state that, so I think option B's V is incorrect.

Looking at option C, the denominator for V is (d c - d·v). Let me see: d is a vector, so d c is c times the vector d, and d·v is the scalar product of d and v. So the denominator is a scalar: c |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ), where d̂ is the unit vector in d's direction.

So the denominator would be c |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c ). So V would be (q c) / [4π ε₀ (c |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )) ] = q/(4π ε₀ |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c )).

Wait, but why would the denominator have 1 - (v·d̂)/c? That would imply that the potential is modified by the velocity, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps this is considering the time dilation or the motion of the charge affecting the potential.

Wait, but I thought the scalar potential V is just Coulomb's law, independent of velocity. So that makes me think that option C's expression for V might be incorrect.

Wait, another thought: in the context of relativity, the potentials might have terms that include the velocity. But I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in V is not |d| but something else, like (c tr - (d · v)).

Wait, another approach: using the expression for the potentials in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4π ε₀)) [1/( r - (v/c^2)(r - s(tr)) ) ] 

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the general expression for the potentials when the charge is moving. The scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4π ε₀) [ 1 / ( |d| (1 - (v·d̂)/c) ) ]

Wait, that would explain a denominator like (1 - (v·d̂)/c ). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I remember that the denominator for the potentials when a charge is moving can involve terms that account for the finite speed of light and the motion of the charge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: think about the units. The options for V must have units of volts. Let's check each option.

Option A: V is (q)/(4π ε₀ r). The units of 1/(4π ε₀) are N m²/C², so when multiplied by q (C), and divided by r (m), V has units of (N m²/C²) * (C/m) ) = N m/C = V. Correct.

A's V looks correct in units.

The vector potential A has units of Tesla·m² (since B is Tesla, and A is Tesla·m², but wait, no, A's units are Weber per square meter (Wb/m²), which is the same as T·m²/m² = T. No, wait, Weber is T·m², so Weber/m² is T. So vector potential A is in Weber/m²? Or perhaps another way.

Wait, vector potential's units are volts·seconds (V·s) or equivalently T·m². Let me see: Each option's A should have units of V·s.

Option A: A is (v^2)/(c^2) V. Wait, velocity squared is (m/s)^2. c squared is (m/s)^2. So v²/c² is dimensionless. So A has same units as V. But V is in volts; so A would be in volts, which is not correct. Because vector potential has units of V·s. So option A's A is incorrect in units.

Option B: A is (v/c²) V. v is m/s, c² is m²/s². So v/c² is 1/(m/s). So (v/c²) V has units of (1/(m/s)) * V. V is J/C = N·m/C. 1/(m/s) is s/m. So units would be (s/m) * (N·m/C) )= (N·s)/(C·m). Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the correct expression. The vector potential A is known to be (μ₀/(4π)) (q v) / (|d| c²) ) * d̂. So the units are (H/m) * (C) * (m/s) / (m²) ) * (1/m) ), but perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, let's think about the correct expression for A. The standard expression for A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |d|) times the unit vector in d's direction. So the units of A would be (H/m) * C * (m/s) / m ) = (H C)/ (m² s ). Hmm, not sure, but in any case, perhaps looking at the options can help.

Option C: V has units q/(4π ε₀ (d c - d·v)). The denominator is (d c - d·v). d is a vector, but in the denominator, it's in the context of the expression. Wait, but the denominator must be a scalar. So perhaps it's (d c)·d̂ - (d·v) ?

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v)), which would be a scalar. So the denominator for V would have units of m (since |d| is m, and (d · v) is m²/s, so no, that's a problem because you can't subtract terms with different units). So that can't be right, which suggests that option C's expression for V is incorrect because the denominator would have inconsistent units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The denominator in option C is (d c - d . v). Since d is a vector, d multiplied by c (a scalar) is a vector. d . v is a scalar. So the subtraction is between a vector and a scalar, which is impossible. So that's a mistake in option C; it's a dimensionally inconsistent expression. So option C is invalid.

Wait, that can't be right because the options probably are correctly written. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the denominator. Oh, perhaps the denominator is (d × c - (d · v)), but that's also not a scalar.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v) ), but with d in terms of its magnitude. For example, |d| c minus (d · v). Because d is a vector, |d| is its magnitude. So (d · v) is |d| v cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So, the denominator becomes |d| c - |d| (v cosθ) ) = |d| (c - v cosθ).

So the denominator would be |d| multiplied by (c - v cosθ), which is a scalar. So V would be (q c )/(4π ε₀ |d| (c - v cosθ) )? Because that's what option C shows:

V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - (d · v)))

Wait, because d c would be |d| c, and d · v is |d| v cosθ. So the denominator is |d| (c - v cosθ), so V becomes (qc)/(4π ε₀ |d| (c - v cosθ)).

Hmm, but I'm not sure why it's multiplied by c in the numerator. The standard scalar potential is q/(4π ε₀ |d| ), so why would this expression have a c in the numerator and denominator?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential is related to the current. So the current is J = q v δ³(r - s(tr)). The vector potential A is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) ∫ [ J(r', t_r) / |r - r'| ] d^3 r'

So for a point charge, this becomes (μ₀ q v)/(4π c² |d|) times the unit vector in d's direction. So A is proportional to v and 1/|d|.

Looking at option C, A is (mu0 qc v) / (4 pi (d c - d · v) ). So the denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) as before. So A would be (mu0 q c v) / (4 pi |d| (c - v·d̂) ) ).

But wait, the standard expression for A is (mu0 q v)/(4 pi c^2 |d| ), which doesn't have a factor of c in the numerator. So unless there's a factor I'm missing, option C's A doesn't match the standard form.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of c somewhere. Let's think: the vector potential A is given by (mu0/(4 pi c^2)) (q v)/( |d| ), because J is q v δ(r - s), and integrating that gives (q v)/(4 pi |d|) multiplied by mu0/(c^2), since A is (mu0/(4 pi)) * integral ( J / |r - r'| ) d^3r'.

So A = (mu0/(4 pi c^2)) ) (q v) / |d| ) * (d/|d|) ), because J's contribution is at r' = s(tr), so the direction is (r - s(tr)) / |r - s(tr)| which is d/|d|.

So A = (mu0 q v) / (4 pi c^2 |d|²) ) * d.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option C's A is (mu0 qc v ) / (4 pi (d c - d · v) ). Which would be (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi |d| (c - (d · v)/|d|) ) ) * (d/|d|) )

Hmm, not sure. Let me compute the denominator again. The denominator in option C is (d c - d · v) = |d| (c - (d · v)/|d|) ), so the denominator is |d| (c - v · d̂ ), where d̂ is the unit vector in d's direction.

So A would be (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi |d| (c - v · d̂ )) )

But in the standard expression, A is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| ) * (d/|d| ), which is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d|²) ) d.

So for the two expressions to match, the factors would have to be the same. So in option C, the numerator is mu0 qc v, and denominator is 4 pi |d| (c - v · d̂ )

Wait, so (mu0 q c v) / (4 pi |d| (c - v · d̂ )) ) = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d|²) ) d ?

But that doesn't seem to match unless (c - v · d̂ ) is proportional to |d|.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the correct expression for the potentials.

The scalar potential V(r, t) is (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), and the vector potential A is (mu0/(4 pi c^2)) (q v)/( |d| ) * (d/|d| )

So A can be written as (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d|²) ) * d.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option C: A is (mu0 qc v )/(4 pi (d c - d · v) )

The denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂ ) )

So A would be (mu0 q c v) / (4 pi |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) )

But in the standard expression, the denominator is |d|², and the numerator is q v.

Hmm, unless (c - (v · d̂ )) ) is equal to |d| / c^2 or something, but I'm not seeing that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the potentials is option B. Let's look at option B:

V = q/(4 pi eps0 r ), A = (v / c^2 ) V.

So substituting, A = (v / c^2 ) * ( q/(4 pi eps0 r ) )

But in the standard expression, A is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 r ). Because mu0 = 1/(eps0 c^2 ), so substituting:

A = (1/(eps0 c^2 )) * ( q v )/(4 pi r )

Which is (v / (eps0 c^4 )) * ( q )/(4 pi r )

Wait, that doesn't match option B's A, which is (v/c^2) * (q/(4 pi eps0 r )).

Wait, standard A is:

mu0/(4 pi) * (q v )/(c^2 |d| )

Because mu0 = 1/(eps0 c^2 ), so this is (1/(4 pi eps0 c^2 )) * ( q v )/( |d| )

Which is ( q v )/(4 pi eps0 c^2 |d| )

So A is (v/c^2) * (q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ) )

Which is (v/c^2) V.

So option B's A is (v/c^2) V, which matches the standard expression. And option B's V is correct if |d|= r, but wait, that's only if the charge is at the origin at time tr. Because |d| is |r - s(tr)|, which isn't necessarily equal to r. So option B's V is correct only if s(tr) is zero, which isn't generally the case.

Hmm, but the problem states that the origin is the reference frame's origin, and s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr. So d is r - s(tr), and |d| isn't necessarily r. So option B's V is incorrect because it assumes that the charge is at the origin, which isn't given.

So, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The correct expressions for V and A are:

V = q/(4 pi eps0 |d| )

A = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| ) * (d/|d| )

Which can be written as (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d|² ) * d.

But how does that match the options?

Looking at option C:

V = (qc)/(4 pi eps0 (d c - (d · v) )) 

= (q c )/(4 pi eps0 |d| ( c - (v · d̂ )) )

And A = (mu0 qc v )/(4 pi (d c - (d · v )) )

Which is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) )

Hmm, comparing to the standard expressions, which have:

V_standard = q/(4 pi eps0 |d| )

A_standard = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c² |d| ) * (d/|d| )

So V in option C has an extra factor of c in numerator and denominator, which suggests it's incorrect. So option C's V is (q c )/(4 pi eps0 |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ), which doesn't match V_standard.

So, none of the options seem to exactly match, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the potentials' expressions must satisfy Maxwell's equations. For the scalar and vector potentials, the Lorenz gauge condition is satisfied when ∇ · A + (1/c²) ∂V/∂t = 0.

But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, the electric field is E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t.

In the case where the charge is moving with velocity v, the electric field isn't just due to the charge but also due to the motion, and the magnetic field arises from the current. But perhaps that's more about the fields than the potentials.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about the terms.

The denominator in option C's V is (d c - d · v ). Which would be |d| c - (d · v ). If the charge is moving in the same direction as d, then (d · v) is |d| v cosθ, where θ is the angle between d and v. So the denominator is |d| (c - v cosθ).

So, V = (q c) / [4 pi eps0 |d| (c - v cosθ) ) ]

Hmm, but I don't recall this term in the standard expression for the scalar potential. The standard expression is V = q/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), without any dependence on velocity. So perhaps the velocity affects the vector potential but not the scalar.

So, perhaps option B's expressions for V and A are correct, assuming that the charge is at the origin when it emits the field. But the problem states that the charge is at s(tr), not necessarily the origin. So option B's V is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the charge's position at t_r to be at the origin. If that's the case, then d = r, and option B's V and A would be correct. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should go back to the basics. The scalar potential is due to the charge and is given by Coulomb's law at the retarded time. The vector potential is due to the current and is given by the Biot-Savart law for the point charge moving with velocity v.

So, the potentials are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| )

A(r, t) = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| ) * (d/|d| )

Which can be rewritten as:

A = (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d|^2 ) d

Looking at the options, option C's A is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - d · v )) )

Which is (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) )

So, comparing to our expression, the denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ), and the numerator is mu0 q c v.

Our expression has the numerator as mu0 q v and the denominator as 4 pi c^2 |d|^2.

So, for these to be equal, we need:

mu0 q c v / [4 pi |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ] = mu0 q v / [4 pi c^2 |d|^2 ]

Canceling terms (mu0 q v on both sides, 4 pi denominator, etc.):

c / [ |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ] = 1/( c^2 |d|^2 )

Multiply both sides by |d| (c - v · d̂ ) c^2 |d|^2:

c * c^2 |d|^2 = |d| (c - v · d̂ )

=> c^3 |d|^2 = |d| (c - v · d̂ )

Divide both sides by |d| (assuming |d| ≠ 0):

c^3 |d| = c - (v · d̂ )

Hmm, that seems unlikely unless |d| is a specific value. So perhaps option C's expression isn't matching the standard expression.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option B, assuming that the charge is at the origin at time t_r, making |d|=r.

But wait, the problem doesn't state that. So, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible as one of them must be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the expression for the vector potential. Maybe the vector potential includes a term dependent on the velocity's direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector potential is given by (mu0 q v)/(4 pi |d| c²) ), which is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c² |d| ), and if I factor that, it's (v/(c²)) * [mu0 q/(4 pi |d| ) ].

But since mu0/(4 pi) is 1/(eps0 c²), then [mu0 q/(4 pi |d| ) ] = [q/(eps0 c² |d| ) ].

So, A becomes (v/(c²)) * ( q/(eps0 c² |d| ) ) )

Which is (v/(c^4)) * (q/(eps0 |d| )) )

Which is (v/(c^4)) * (4 pi eps0 V )

Because V is (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| )

Hmm, so A = (v/(c^4)) * (4 pi eps0 V )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Another approach: the vector potential is A = (v/c²) V, as in option B.

So if A = (v/c²) V, then substituting V gives A = (v/c²) (q/(4 pi eps0 |d| )) )

Which is the same as our earlier expression if mu0/(4 pi) = 1/(eps0 c²), which is correct.

So yes, A = (v/c²) V.

So, if V is correct as (q/(4 pi eps0 |d| )), and A is (v/c²) V, then the potentials would be as option B suggests, provided that |d| is r, i.e., the charge is at the origin when the field is generated.

But the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps option B is incorrect unless the charge is at the origin.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another thought: when considering the potentials for a charge in motion, the scalar potential is the same as the static case, but the vector potential arises from the current. So V is (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), and A is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c² |d| ) * (d/|d| )

But in option B, A is (v/c²) V, so substituting V, A = (v/c²) * (q)/(4 pi eps0 |d| )

Comparing to the standard expression for A, which is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| ) * (d/|d| ), and since mu0/(4 pi) = 1/(eps0 c^2 ), then:

A = (1/(eps0 c^2 )) * (q v )/(4 pi |d| ) ) * (d/|d| )

Which is (q v )/(4 pi eps0 c^2 |d| ) ) * (d/|d| )

Which can be written as (v/c^2) * ( q )/(4 pi eps0 |d| ) ) * (d/|d| )

But option B's A is (v/c^2) * ( q )/(4 pi eps0 |d| ), which is a scalar, but in reality, A is a vector. So option B's A is a vector only if (v) is a vector, but in option B, it's written as v, so that's correct.

Wait, but in option B, A is (v/c²) V, which would be (v/c²) * (q)/(4 pi eps0 r ), which again assumes that |d| = r, which is only true if the charge is at the origin. So option B is only correct if the charge is at the origin at time t_r.

But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the vector potential can also be written in terms of the velocity. Let's see, option C's vector potential is:

A = (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi (d c - (d · v) ) )

Which, as I thought earlier, the denominator is |d| (c - v cosθ )

So,

A = (mu0 q c v )/(4 pi |d| (c - v cosθ ) )

But from the standard expression, A is (mu0 q v )/(4 pi c^2 |d| ) * (d/|d| )

So comparing this to option C's A, the denominator in option C is (c - v cosθ ), and the numerator has an extra c.

So if (c - v cosθ ) = c^2 |d| / (4 pi ... ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option B, assuming that the charge is at the origin when the field is generated. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps option B is the intended correct answer.

Wait, but the problem states that d is the vector from s(tr) to r. So if s(tr) is not the origin, then V can't be (q)/(4 pi eps0 r ), which is option B's V. Because r is the vector from the origin.

So I think option B is incorrect because it assumes the charge is at the origin.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Another approach: think about the units of the options.

Option D: V is ( q c )/(4 pi eps0 (d c + d · v ) )

Hmm, the denominator is |d| c + (d · v ), which would have units of m + (m²/s ), which is invalid. So option D is dimensionally incorrect.

So, D is invalid.

So, between options A, B, and C.

Option A: V is Coulomb's law as if the charge were at the origin, but the vector potential is (v^2)/(c^2) V. The units for A would be (m²/s² )/( m²/s² ) * V = V, which is wrong. So A's A is incorrect in units.

Option B: V is Coulomb's law with r instead of |d|, which implies s(tr) is the origin, but the vector potential's units are correct.

But since the problem doesn't state that, perhaps option B isn't correct.

Option C: The denominator is |d| (c - (v · d̂ )) ), which is a scalar. The numerator for V has units of charge * velocity (since c has units of m/s), so (q c )/( ... ) has units of (C·m/s)/(m) ) = (C/s ), which is not correct for voltage (V = J/C = N·m/C ). So this can't be correct.

Wait, no, option C's V is ( q c )/( ... ), so the units would be (C·m/s) / (m ), which is C/s²? No, wait: (q has units C, c is m/s, and the denominator is m. So overall, (C * m/s ) / m ) = C/(s ), which is current, not voltage. So option C's V has the wrong units.

Wait, that can't be right. So option C's V is incorrect in units.

Hmm, that leaves option B as the only viable option, despite the earlier confusion about |d|=r.

Wait, but V has units of volts. Let me recheck:

Option B: V = q/(4 pi eps0 r )

Q is in Coulombs, 4 pi eps0 r is in C·m/(V·m) · m → (C·m )/(V·m ) ) * m → C/(V ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, 1/(4 pi eps0 ) has units of N·m²/C². So 1/(4 pi eps0 ) * q has units of N·m²/C² * C = N·m²/C.

Divided by r (meters), so overall units are (N·m²/C ) / m = N·m/C = V. So yes, correct.

So, option B's V has correct units, and A would have units of (m/s ) * V → (m/s) * (N·m/C) )= N·s·m/(C·m )= N·s/C = T·m². Because Tesla is N/(A·m ), so T·m² is (N/(A·m )) * m² = N·m/A. Since A is coulombs per second, N·m/A = (N·s )/C → which matches the units of vector potential (V·s ). So option B's A has correct units.

Hmm, perhaps despite my confusion earlier, option B is the correct answer. Because the vector potential A is (v/c²) V, which matches the standard expression.

So, despite the charge not being at the origin, perhaps the problem simplifies the scenario by assuming d is r, making option B correct.


The problem involves determining the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), where the displacement vector \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V \):**
   - The scalar potential is derived from the Coulomb potential at the retarded time. For a static charge, \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \), where \( |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between the charge's position at \( t_r \) and the observation point \( \vec{r} \).
   - In the options, \( V \) is expressed in terms of \( \vec{r} \) or \( \vec{d} \). Option B assumes \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \), which is valid if the charge is at the origin at \( t_r \). However, the problem does not explicitly state this, so \( V \) should ideally depend on \( |\vec{d}| \), not \( r \).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A} \):**
   - The vector potential arises from the current due to the moving charge. It is proportional to \( \vec{v} \) and inversely proportional to \( |\vec{d}| \), with a factor of \( \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi c^2} \).
   - The standard expression for \( \vec{A} \) is \( \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi c^2 |\vec{d}|^2} \vec{d} \). This can also be written as \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \), where \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|} \).

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V \) is dimensionally inconsistent because \( \vec{v}^2/c^2 \) is dimensionless, leaving \( \vec{A} \) with the same units as \( V \), which is incorrect for a vector potential.
   - **Option B:** \( V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \) assumes the charge is at the origin at \( t_r \), making \( |\vec{d}| = r \). While this simplifies the expression, it is not generally valid unless explicitly stated. However, \( \vec{A} = \frac{\vec{v}}{c^2} V \) matches the standard form of the vector potential if \( |\vec{d}| = r \), making this option plausible under the assumption that the charge is at the origin.
   - **Option C:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) include terms like \( \frac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \) and \( \frac{\mu_0 qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \). The denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) introduces a velocity-dependent correction, but this is inconsistent with the standard expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), which do not depend on velocity in this way.
   - **Option D:** The denominator \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is dimensionally inconsistent, as it mixes terms with different units (length and length-velocity). This makes Option D invalid.

### Conclusion:
Option B is the most consistent with the standard expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), assuming the charge is at the origin at \( t_r \). While the problem does not explicitly state this, Option B aligns with the given notation and simplifies the scenario appropriately.

**Answer: B**
