Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me think about what I know.

So, the problem says that two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity method. They both have the same mass, which probably means their actual masses are similar, but I'm not sure if that affects the transit probability directly. The key factors for transit probability are the orbital period, the star's mass, and the star's radius, I think.

The question says that Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1 and P2 is 3P1. But wait, since the period is shorter, Planet_1 must be orbiting closer to its star, right? Because for a star, a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit (like Mercury has a shorter period than Jupiter).

Now, both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. But the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So M1 = 2 * M2. Hmm.

The probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, but more importantly, the relative sizes of their orbits. Wait, noâ€”actually, the transit probability is mainly determined by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's size. Or wait, no. Let me think again.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is higher when the star is larger because the planet has a higher chance of passing in front of
