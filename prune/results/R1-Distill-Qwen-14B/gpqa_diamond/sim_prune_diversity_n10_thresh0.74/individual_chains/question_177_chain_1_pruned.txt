Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars. There's Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, the problem says they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength. And the radial velocities are given: Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. The question is about how much greater the luminosity of Star_1 is compared to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem mentions the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh right, that's Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's interesting because I thought maybe they would have different temperatures, but no, same λ_max implies same T.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that they computed the luminosities. Oh, but the stars have different radii and masses. But wait, since the temperatures are same, the luminosity difference comes just from the radius. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Wait, but let me make sure. Because R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So why are the options different, with some around 2.23, 2.32, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait, the problem also gives radial velocities. Star_1 is moving towards or away with 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength?

Wait, that's the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, meaning the observed wavelength is shorter. If moving away, redshifted. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. So the actual temperatures might be different, but due to Doppler shifting, their observed λ_max are same.

Wait, that's probably right. Because the problem says they found the same wavelengths at which they appeared brightest. So the observed λ_max is same, but the actual emitted λ_max (related to temperature) might be different.

Ah, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the star's actual temperature affects the emitted λ_max, but due to Dop
