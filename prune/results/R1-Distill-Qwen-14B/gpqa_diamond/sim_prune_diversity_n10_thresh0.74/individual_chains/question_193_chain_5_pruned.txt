Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. But wait, I think the exact formula is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

So the problem states N varies as 1/plx^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, since plx is inversely proportional to distance. Let's see, 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5, because 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, wait. Let's think carefully.

Wait, N = k * (1/plx^5), and since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number
