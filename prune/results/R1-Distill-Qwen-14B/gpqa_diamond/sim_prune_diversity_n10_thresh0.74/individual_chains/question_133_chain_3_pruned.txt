Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of equilibrium problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So the solution has two components: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are phosphoric acid salts. I remember that these salts can dissociate in water, affecting the pH and the concentration of the phosphate species.

First, let me jot down the given information. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The masses of the two compounds are 1.00 g each. The molecular weights (Mw) are provided: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think activity coefficients will complicate things here.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. I think these are important because they'll help determine the pH of the solution, which in turn affects the concentration of PO4^3-.

Now, I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might come into play here. But wait, which species are present?

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. I think it dissociates in water as KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. When dissolved, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O. So the main species here are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I think both of these can act as acids and bases. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but in solution, the predominant species depends on the pH. Since the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That would relate to Ka2, since H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid would be H2PO4^- and the base would be HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution also has KH2PO4, which gives H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^-
