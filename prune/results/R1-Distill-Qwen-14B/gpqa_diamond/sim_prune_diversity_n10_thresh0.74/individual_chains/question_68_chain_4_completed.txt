Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in different magnetic fields. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the particle has a spin 1/2 and a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So mu = gamma * Sz. Got it.

Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment aligns with this field. Then, suddenly the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude B. After that, the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. We need to find the oscillation frequency.

Hmm. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with B, so in the Sz basis. When the field is switched to Y, the direction changes. But wait, the spin suddenly changes the direction in which it's aligned. But wait, spin is a quantum mechanical property, so when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes.

Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. But wait, I think it's H = -μ·B, but wait, in some conventions it's H = -μ·B, but others might write it as H = μ·B. Wait, no, I think it's H = -μ·B, because the energy is lower when the moment is aligned with the field. So if the magnetic moment is in the same direction as B, the potential energy is lower.

Wait, in this case, mu is given as gamma * Sz, so H would be -gamma * Sz * B_z. But when the field is along Z, B is in Z, so B_z = B, and others are zero.

Wait, initially, the magnetic field is along Z. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. The eigenstates of Sz are |+> and |->, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 respectively, multiplied by ħ, but wait, wait, let's be precise.

Wait, the spin matrices for spin 1/2 have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for Sz. Wait, so Sz |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and similarly for the down state.

But the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, so mu_z is gamma times S_z. Wait, but S_z has units of ħ/2, so mu_z would be gamma * (ħ/2) for the up state. 

But when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy levels are determined by H = -mu · B. So the energy is E = -mu_z * B. But wait, if mu is gamma * Sz, then E = -gamma * Sz * B. So in terms of the eigenstates, the energies would be E_+ = -gamma*(ħ/2)*B and E_- = +gamma*(ħ/2)*B? Wait, no, because for |+z>, Sz is ħ/2, so E = -gamma*(ħ/2) * B. For |−z>, it's -gamma*(-ħ/2)*B = gamma*(ħ/2)*B. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the sign.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the energy as E = - mu · B. So if mu is along B, the energy is minimized. So for mu in +z, direction same as B: energy is -mu*B. So E = - (gamma * (ħ/2)) * B. For the -z state, mu is -gamma*(ħ/2), so E = - ( -gamma*(ħ/2) ) * B = gamma*(ħ/2)*B. So the energy levels are split by gamma*B*ħ.

Now, when the magnetic field is suddenly switched from +Z to +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H' = -mu · B, but B is now along Y. So H' = -mu · B_y. Wait, or wait, the field is along +Y, so the Hamiltonian is H' = -mu * B in Y direction.

Wait, but mu is a vector. When the field is along Y, the magnetic moment's interaction is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = - mu_y * B. But mu is given as gamma * Sz. Wait, wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is a vector. So in the original state, it's along Z, but when the field is turned along Y, the magnetic moment's direction of interaction changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin vector. So mu has components mu_x, mu_y, mu_z. So when the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H' = - mu · B (since B is along Y, so only B_y component is non-zero). So H' = - mu_y * B. 

But mu_y is gamma * S_y. So H' = - gamma * S_y * B. 

Wait, but S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, which is a Pauli matrix times ħ/2. So the operator H' is proportional to S_y.

But the initial state of the spin is aligned along the original magnetic field, which was along +Z. So the initial state is |+z>. Now, when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the spin state doesn't change instantaneously; it's still |+z>. But the Hamiltonian is now H' = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but S_y for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2) * σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix. So H' would be proportional to σ_y.

So the time evolution is governed by this new Hamiltonian. The state will evolve under H', and we need to find the time dependence of <Sz>, the expectation value of the z-component of the spin.

So let's model this. The state after the field change is |ψ(0)> = |+z> = |↑z>.

The time evolution is given by |ψ(t)> = exp(-i H' t / ħ) |ψ(0)>.

Let me write H' in terms of the Pauli matrices. H' = -gamma B (ħ/2) σ_y. Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So H' = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.

We can factor out the constants: H' = - (gamma B ħ / 2 ) [ σ_y ].

So, the exponential becomes exp( i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) σ_y t / ħ ) = exp( i (gamma B / 2 ) σ_y t ).

Wait, because (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ = (gamma B t / 2 ) * (ħ/ħ) )= (gamma B t / 2 ).

So, the time evolution operator is exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) σ_y ).

Hmm, but exponentiating a Pauli matrix. Let me recall that for a Pauli matrix σ, exp(i θ σ) = I cosθ + i σ sinθ. Because (σ)^2 = I, so the expansion is straightforward.

So, σ_y is a Hermitian matrix, and for any real θ, exp(i θ σ_y) = cosθ * I + i sinθ * σ_y.

So, applying this to |↑z>:

|ψ(t)> = [ cos( (gamma B t / 2 ) ) I + i sin( (gamma B t / 2 ) ) σ_y ] |↑z>.

Let me compute each term. Let me denote theta = (gamma B t / 2 ).

The first term is cos(theta) I acting on |↑z> → cos(theta) |↑z>.

The second term is i sin(theta) σ_y |↑z> → i sin(theta) times σ_y |↑z>.

What's σ_y |↑z>? The Pauli matrix σ_y in the basis |↑z>, |↓z> is:

σ_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, wait no. Let me get the matrix correct. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So σ_y |↑z> = [ 0, -i ]^T.

Wait, because |↑z> is the vector [1; 0], so σ_y |↑z> is [0, -i; i, 0 ] * [1; 0] = [0*1 + (-i)*0; i*1 + 0*0 ]? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the matrix multiplied correctly.

Wait, matrix multiplication: the first row of σ_y is [0, -i], so when multiplied by [1; 0], it gives 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0. The second row is [i, 0], so i*1 + 0*0 = i.

So σ_y |↑z> is [0; i].

So when we multiply by i sin(theta), we get i sin(theta) [0; i] = [0; i^2 sin(theta)] = [0; (-1) sin(theta)].

So putting it together, |ψ(t)> = [ cos(theta) |↑z> ] + [ 0 |↑z> - sin(theta) |↓z> ].

Wait, because the first term is cos(theta) |↑z> and the second term is [0; - sin(theta) ].

So |ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |↑z> - sin(theta) |↓z>.

So the state is a superposition of |↑z> and |↓z> with coefficients cos(theta) and -sin(theta), respectively.

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of spin. Remember that Sz is diagonal in the z-basis, so <Sz> = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>.

Sz is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So when acting on |↑z>, it gives (ħ/2) * 1 |↑z>, and |↓z> gives (ħ/2) (-1) |↓z>.

The expectation value would be:

<ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [cos(theta), -sin(theta)] * (ħ/2) diag(1, -1) * [cos(theta); -sin(theta)].

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

The state |ψ(t)> is cos(theta) |↑z> - sin(theta) |↓z>.

So ψ(t) is a column vector [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Sz is (ħ/2) [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

So, ψ(t)† Sz ψ(t) is:

[ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ]^T.

Let's compute the matrix multiplication:

First, [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos(theta), - sin(theta) ] = [ cos(theta)*1 + 0*(- sin(theta)), ... ] ?

Wait, no, when you multiply a matrix by a vector, each element is the dot product of the matrix row with the vector.

So the product would be:

First element: 1*cos(theta) + 0*(-sin(theta)) )= cos(theta).

Second element: 0*cos(theta) + (-1)*(-sin(theta)) )= sin(theta).

So the vector after multiplying Sz is (ħ/2) [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ].

Then, the outer product with ψ(t)† (which is [ cos(theta), -sin(theta) ]) is:

[ cos(theta), -sin(theta) ] * (ħ/2) [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ].

So it's (ħ/2) [ cos(theta)*cos(theta) + (-sin(theta))(sin(theta)) ) ].

So (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ) ].

Which is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

Wait, because cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) = cos(2 theta).

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

But theta is (gamma B t / 2), as defined earlier.

So theta = (gamma B t)/2.

So 2 theta = gamma B t.

So <Sz> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, right? So mu_z = gamma * S_z.

So <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz>.

So substituting, <mu_z> = gamma * [ (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ) ].

But wait, what's ħ in terms of the units here? Wait, in this case, the energy levels are in terms of ħ. But perhaps I can express the frequency without getting into the units.

But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment. So the expectation value is oscillating as cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t in the cosine function, divided by 2π. Because the function cos(omega t) has frequency omega/(2π).

Wait, yes, frequency f is omega/(2π), where omega is the angular frequency.

In our case, <mu_z> oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency omega is gamma B.

So the frequency f is (gamma B) / (2π) ).

Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency. So the options are given in terms of gamma and B, without the 2π factor. So perhaps the problem is referring to the angular frequency, not the frequency in Hz.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement.

The question says: What is its oscillation frequency?

In physics, frequency can sometimes refer to angular frequency. But I should check the options. The options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

Hmm. So looking at our result, the angular frequency is gamma*B. So the answer would be B) gamma*B. So the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, earlier I had theta = (gamma B t)/2. Then, the argument in the cosine is gamma B t (since 2 theta is gamma B t). So the angular frequency is (gamma B).

So the average <mu_z> oscillates with angular frequency gamma B.

So the correct answer would be option B: gamma*B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you switch the magnetic field direction, you might have a different scenario. Let me think again. Another approach: the energy levels when the field is along Y are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2 ). The energy splitting is gamma B ħ. The transition frequency between the states would be (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) ) / ħ = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

Yes, that seems to confirm it.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$ corresponding to $S_z = +\hbar/2$, i.e., the state $|+z\rangle$.

2. **Hamiltonian After Field Change**: When the magnetic field is along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes:
   \[
   H' = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y,
   \]
   where $S_y$ is the spin operator in the $y$-direction. In terms of Pauli matrices, $S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, so:
   \[
   H' = -\frac{\gamma B \hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. Starting from $|+z\rangle$, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-i H' t / \hbar} |+z\rangle.
   \]
   Substituting $H'$, the time evolution operator becomes:
   \[
   e^{-i H' t / \hbar} = e^{i \frac{\gamma B t}{2} \sigma_y}.
   \]
   Using the identity $\exp(i \theta \sigma_y) = \cos(\theta) I + i \sin(\theta) \sigma_y$, the evolved state is:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|+z\rangle - i \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right)|-z\rangle.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $\mu_z$**: The magnetic moment $\mu_z$ is related to $S_z$ by $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the evolved state and using $S_z |+z\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|+z\rangle$ and $S_z |-z\rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2}|-z\rangle$, the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ oscillates as $\cos(\gamma B t)$, so the angular frequency of oscillation is $\omega = \gamma B$.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) $\gamma B / 2$**: Incorrect. The angular frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.
- **B) $\gamma B$**: Correct. The angular frequency of oscillation is $\gamma B$.
- **C) $\sqrt{2} \gamma B$**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the angular frequency.
- **D) $\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$**: Incorrect. The angular frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.

**Answer: B**
