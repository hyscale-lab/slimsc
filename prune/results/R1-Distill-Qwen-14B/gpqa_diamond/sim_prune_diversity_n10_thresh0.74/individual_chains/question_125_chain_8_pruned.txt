Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, I remember that the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². That makes sense because it's similar to the 3D version of the harmonic oscillator, where each direction (x, y, z) behaves like a 1D oscillator.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy. So I need to figure out both the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy).

Wait, what's the third excited state in this context? Oh right, the ground state is the lowest energy level, so the first excited state is the next one, then the second, and the third would be after that. So the ground state is n=0, first excited n=1, third excited would be n=3? Or wait, no, in terms of principal quantum numbers in 3D, it's a bit different.

Wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, each direction is a 1D oscillator, so the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, another way to represent this is using the total quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy becomes E = ħω (n + 3/2).

So the ground state is when n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0), first excited state would be n=1, second excited n=2, third
