Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about radioactive decay, which I've studied a bit before. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that we're observing a single atom, and we know from previous experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, is it 150 minutes from the start or from the current time?

Wait, the question says the next 150 minutes. So after the 50 minutes that have already passed, we're looking ahead 150 more. Oh wait no, wait. Let me read it again. So, 50 minutes have passed, the atom hasn't decayed. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But I'm not sure if that's how the problem is set up.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the decay process. Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the key thing is that the probability of decay depends on the time elapsed and the decay constant.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's like the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 0.32. Using the exponential decay model, the probability of decay in time t is 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

So, first, let's find λ. Since the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32, that gives:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
=> e^(-100λ) = 0.68
Take natural logarithm on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and ln(0.7) is about -0.356. 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.5. Wait, no: 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6. Oh, wait, 0.68 is less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) is more negative than ln(0.7). Hmm, let me think. Let me approximate ln(0.68). Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it exactly.

But perhaps it's easier to work symbolically first. So λ is [ln(1/0.68)] / 100, which is [ln(1.470588)] / 100. Wait, no, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.470588. So ln(1.470588) is about 0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because 0.68 is the value of e^(-100λ), so taking ln of that gives -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Then, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. But wait, the next 150 minutes from when? From the start or from now?

Ah, the question says "the next 150 minutes"—so that would be the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the process. So the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the probability that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50), and then the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is [1 - e^(-λ * 150)] minus the probability that it has already decayed.

Wait, no. Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. Wait, no. Wait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed up to now, is the same as the probability of decay in the first t minutes. But wait, no—actually, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of how much time has already passed.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The memoryless property of the exponential distribution says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same as for a new atom. So, in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150). But wait, that doesn't consider that 50 minutes have already passed. Wait, no—because it's the next 150 minutes from the current time. So the probability is indeed 1 - e^(-λ * 150). But wait, that would be the case if the 150 minutes started from time zero. No, wait, the 150 minutes are after the 50 minutes. So the remaining time is 150 minutes.

Wait, but the 150 minutes is a future period. So the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm. Alternatively, the conditional probability. So the joint probability P(decay between 50 and 200 minutes) is equal to P(decay in 200 min) - P(decay in 50 min). So that's [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

But the conditional probability is that, divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, which is e^(-50λ).

So the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 min | not decayed in first 50) is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ) = 1 - e^(-150 λ).

Wait, that's interesting. So the conditional probability ends up being 1 - e^(-150λ), which is the same as the probability of decaying in the first 150 minutes. So that's how the memoryless property works.

So regardless of the 50 minutes that have passed, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So now, let's compute this. Let's compute λ first.

We know that in 100 minutes, the probability is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-100 λ)
=> e^(-100 λ) = 0.68
Take natural log of both sides:
-100 λ = ln(0.68)
So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ (0.38566) / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, wait, ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So when we multiply by -100, we get 38.566, so λ = 38.566 / 100 = 0.38566 per 100 minutes? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait, λ is per minute. So 100 λ is 38.566, so λ is 0.38566 per 100 minutes, which is 0.0038566 per minute.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it accurately.

Compute ln(0.68):

Using calculator, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248.

So λ = 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Now, compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So λ *150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 ≈ 0.57849372.

e^(-0.57849372) ≈ 0.5616.

So 1 - 0.5616 ≈ 0.4384, or 43.84%.

Looking at the options: A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

So the closest is A)44%.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me compute λ more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68) precisely.

Compute ln(0.68):

Using calculator: 0.68 is approximately e^-0.38566248. So yes, λ = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, λ *150 = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

Now, e^(-0.57849372) is about what? Let's compute it. e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065, and e^-0.57 is around 0.564. Let me use a calculator function here.

Alternatively, 0.57849372 is approximately 0.5785.

Compute e^-0.5785:

We can use the Taylor series approximation, but perhaps an easier way is to note that:

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, so 0.5785 is less than that. So e^-0.5785 is approximately 0.5616 as before. Thus, 1 - 0.5616 is 0.4384, which is 43.84%. So the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another second. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute e^-0.57849372.

Let me compute this using a more precise method.

Using a calculator, e^-0.57849372 ≈ 0.5616.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it using the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.5785 is approximately 0.5785.

Let me compute e^0.5785:

e^0.5 = 1.64872,

e^0.07 = about 1.0725,

e^0.5785 = e^(0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0085) = e^0.5 * e^0.07 * e^0.0085 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0725 * 1.00855.

Compute 1.64872 * 1.0725: 1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872, 1.64872 * 0.0725 ≈ 0.11985. So sum is about 1.76857.

Then multiply by 1.00855: 1.76857 * 1.00855 ≈ 1.76857 * (1 + 0.00855) ≈ 1.76857 + (1.76857 *0.00855) ≈ 1.76857 + 0.01512 ≈ 1.78369.

So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.78369. Therefore, e^-0.5785 ≈ 1/1.78369 ≈ 0.5616.

So 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, or 43.84%, which is approximately 44%.

So the correct answer would be option A)44%.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 48%. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is: after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. What is the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

But the way I approached it was to calculate the conditional probability: given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what is the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Which, using the memoryless property, this should be equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, starting from now, which is 1 - e^{-λ*150}.

Ah, but let me double-check that. The memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed up to the present, is the same as the probability of decay in the first t minutes. So it's 1 - e^{-λ t}.

Wait, no. Wait, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is 1 - e^{-λ t}, regardless of how much time has passed. Because the process has no memory.

Wait, but let's model it.

The probability that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^{-λ * 50}.

The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (a span of 150 minutes) is equal to the integral from t=50 to t=200 of λ e^{-λ t} dt.

Compute that integral:

= [ -e^{-λ t} ] from 50 to 200

= (e^{-λ *50} - e^{-λ *200})

The conditional probability is this divided by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, which is e^{-λ *50}.

So:

Conditional Probability = [e^{-50λ} - e^{-200λ}] / e^{-50λ} 

= 1 - e^{-150 λ}

Which is 1 - e^{-λ *150}, as I initially found.

So that part is correct.

So I think my calculation is correct. So the probability is approximately 43.84%, which is closest to option A)44%.

So why is option D 48%? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing λ.

Wait, let me recalculate λ.

We have:

0.32 = 1 - e^{-100 λ}

=> e^{-100 λ} = 0.68

Take natural log:

-100 λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566248 

So, λ = 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes: λ *150 = 0.0038566248 *150 = 0.57849372.

Compute e^{-0.57849372}.

Using a calculator: e^(-0.57849372) ≈ 0.5616.

So 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384, which is 43.84%.

So the answer is approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but the options don't have 43.84%. Hmm, perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, maybe the question uses the decay law t^(1/2) approach. Let me think. The decay probability given for 100 minutes is 32%.

If the decay follows an exponential model, then the decay probability P is 1 - e^{-λ t}.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the decay is modeled using a half-life approach, which is a different model. Wait, but no, the question says "decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes" which sounds like an exponential model, not a half-life, because half-life gives a specific time where the probability is 50%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model, but I think that's unlikely. The problem presents it as a probability, which aligns with the exponential decay model.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute e^{-0.57849372} using more precise steps.

We can use the fact that e^{-x} can be approximated by its Taylor series.

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... for x in any real number.

But for x = 0.57849372, which is positive, so e^{-0.57849372} = 1 / e^{0.57849372}.

So let me compute e^{0.57849372}.

Compute e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.07 = 1.072508, e^0.00849372 ≈ 1.008556.

So e^0.57849372 ≈ e^(0.5 + 0.07 + 0.00849372) = e^0.5 * e^0.07 * e^0.00849372 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.072508 * 1.008556.

Compute 1.64872 *1.072508:

= 1.64872 * (1 + 0.07 + 0.002508)

= 1.64872 + (1.64872 * 0.07) + (1.64872 * 0.002508)

1.64872 *0.07 = 0.1154104

1.64872 * 0.002508 ≈ 0.004133.

So sum: 1.64872 + 0.1154104 = 1.76413 + 0.004133 ≈ 1.76826.

Now multiply by 1.008556:

1.76826 *1.008556 ≈ 1.76826 * 1 + 1.76826 * 0.008556.

1.76826 + (1.76826 * 0.008556) ≈ 1.76826 + 0.01513 ≈ 1.78339.

So e^{0.57849372} ≈ 1.78339.

Then, e^{-0.57849372} ≈ 1/1.78339 ≈ 0.5615.

So 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, or 43.85%, which is approximately 44%.

So the answer should be A)44%.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, where the probability of decay in time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. Using the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is given by:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849372
\]

Now compute \( e^{-0.57849372} \). Using approximations or a calculator:

\[
e^{-0.57849372} \approx 0.5616
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5616 = 0.4384
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately \( 43.84\% \), which rounds to \( 44\% \).

### Final Answer:
The closest option is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A
