Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Wait, the question is about the uncertainty in energy, so I think I need to connect that to momentum somehow.

The problem says the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. Oh wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters because a nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So Δx is 1e-10 m.

I remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So to find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, I can rearrange that. Δp would be approximately ħ/(2Δx). Or wait, sometimes it's written as Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx), but sometimes people use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx for an order of magnitude estimate. Maybe for this problem, using ħ/(2Δx) is precise, but perhaps 2 can be ignored for the exponent calculation.

So I should calculate Δp first. Let me get the values:

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me just take it as 1e-34 for estimation purposes.

Δx is 1e-10 m.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) → (1e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) → 1e-34 / 2e-10 → (1e-24)/2 → 5e-25 kg·m/s. Hmm, but wait, for an
