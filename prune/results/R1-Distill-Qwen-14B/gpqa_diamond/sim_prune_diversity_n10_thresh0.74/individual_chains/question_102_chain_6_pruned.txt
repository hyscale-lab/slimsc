Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving gene expression and fluorescent markers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a situation where someone is studying a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the vector has two ORFs, for the ligand and the receptor.

Looking at the vector setup: the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, how's that set up? So the ligand is first, then the mCherry, and the receptor is after the IRES element, followed by eGFP.

I remember that in bicistronic vectors, especially with IRES elements, the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the second ORF can be translated without the first one being affected. So in this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES. But wait, the ligand has a stop cassette with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272. So how does this affect expression?

Oh, right! The loxP and lox2272 sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So in the absence of Cre, these stop cassettes would block expression of the downstream genes. But when Cre is present, it recombines the sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

So the setup is that the ligand is fused to mCherry, so when expressed, the ligand and mCherry should be co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP, but the stop cassette is between them.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so with the IRES after the receptor ORF? Or is the IRES upstream of the receptor? The question says between the ligand ORF and mCherry there's a stop in a loxP cassette, and between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272. So
