Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model (SM) symmetries. So the first thing I think about is what symmetries the SM itself respects. The SM has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. It also respects gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but that's probably not directly relevant here.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, does it automatically have Poincare symmetry? I think so, because Poincare is the combination of Lorentz and translations. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structure, so Lorentz symmetry must definitely be there. But what about Poincare in this context? I'm a bit confused. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's supposed to be Lorentz invariant. But does that imply Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if the operators are Lorentz invariant, they'd also be Poincare invariant. So maybe both options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries. The Standard Model is approximately C and P symmetric, but not T. But when you put them together, the SM has CPT symmetry. Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimension operators that preserve the SM's gauge symmetry. So, SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM, right?

So, in the SM, CP is not a symmetry because of things like the CKM matrix, which leads to CP violation. So the SM doesn't respect CP. Therefore, SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not something that's required.

What about CPT symmetry? The SM has CPT symmetry because it's a Lorentz-invariant theory, and CPT is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry. So any Lorentz-invariant theory must obey C
