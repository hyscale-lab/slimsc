Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about placing a charge q at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the charges redistribute in a certain way. Since the sphere is conducting, any charge placed near it will induce charges on the sphere. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can flow to the ground, right? So maybe the sphere ends up with an induced charge that's equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge q?

No wait, wait. Let me think again. When you place a charge near a conductor, the conductor's electrons move, creating an induced charge opposite to q on the near side and the same as q on the far side when it's ungrounded. But since this sphere is grounded, the excess charge can leave the sphere, which changes things. Oh right! For a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges would adjust such that the sphere's net charge is zero. Because any induced charge would allow current to flow until the potential is the same as the ground.

Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is grounded, charges can flow in or out until the potential of the sphere's surface is the same as the ground. So the sphere remains at zero potential. Because the ground is at zero, the sphere's potential must match that. So any induced charges would adjust such that the sphere's potential is zero.

But how does that affect the potential energy of the system? Because the potential energy comes from the interaction between the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Hmm, the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charges together. So when you bring the charge q near the sphere, the sphere's induced charges affect the potential energy. But since the sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential, so maybe we can model it as if the sphere's induced charge is such that the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere's induced charge.

Wait, another approach: The system's potential energy is the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so the potential due to all charges at the sphere's surface must be zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the induced charge looks. Let's think about the method of images. For a conducting sphere, when you have a charge
