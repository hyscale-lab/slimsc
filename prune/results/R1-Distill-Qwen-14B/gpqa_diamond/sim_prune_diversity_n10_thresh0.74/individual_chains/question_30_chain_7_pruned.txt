Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from chemistry class. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color is absorbed. Wait, wait. Oh right, when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths, it emits others. Like, the energy difference corresponds to the photon it absorbs.

So, energy of emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/Î». But wait, I might have to find the wavelength to know the color. Because each color corresponds to a specific wavelength.

Wait, but what's the relation between emission and absorption? Oh right, the compound absorbs a photon of higher energy than the emitted one. Because when the molecule gets excited, it's when it absorbs a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one because emission is when the molecule goes back to a lower energy state.

Hmm, so if the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. Because the energy difference between the excited state and ground state is the energy of the emitted photon. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule absorbs a photon, which causes an electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted
