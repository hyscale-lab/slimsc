Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, but I think they have a different way of accelerating particles. Oh wait, right, in a cyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant. It changes over time, I think. 

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. In a cyclotron, particles move in a circular path due to the magnetic field. The electric field provides the acceleration. The key thing is that the frequency of the electric field must match the natural frequency of the particle's motion for it to be accelerated each time it passes through the electric field region. That's called resonance.

But wait, this is a synchrocyclotron. Oh right, synchrocyclotrons have a varying magnetic field. Unlike the cyclotron, where the magnetic field is constant, the field in a synchrocyclotron increases with time. This allows the machine to accelerate particles to much higher energies because the radius of the orbit increases as the energy increases.

So, in a synchrocyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the dees, right? Each time they go through, they gain some energy. The number of revolutions would depend on how many times they're accelerated until they reach the desired kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem states the proton undergoes two accelerations. So, is each acceleration happening once per revolution? Or is each acceleration a step in the process? Or perhaps each acceleration is a time when the voltage is applied, causing the proton to gain energy.

Let me think about the formula for the kinetic energy gained in a synchrocyclotron. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains a certain amount of energy. The voltage applied is U(t), which is oscillating. So the energy gained per revolution (each time it goes through the gap)
