Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the characterization data provided. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the question says that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's look at each technique and what they tell us.

Starting with the FTIR data: the spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around that region typically corresponds to O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which usually suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is another peak. I think that might be related to conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but if the compound has a carbonyl (like from the 1700 peak), and the broad peak at 3000 is O-H, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have both a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). But then what's the 1650? Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have two carbonyl peaks? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is due to something like an aromatic ring with a substituent, like a carbonyl adjacent to a ring, causing some conjugation.

Wait, but another point—what about the possibility of a ketone and an ester? No, that seems unlikely. Or maybe the 1650 is due to an aromatic ring. For example, if the compound is an aromatic ester, the carbonyl (ester) would be around 1700, and the aromatic ring might show a peak around there too. But I'm not too sure about that.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: the spectrum has several peaks, including some that correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests that the molecule has a double bond, maybe an alkene group. So the structure probably includes an alkene. So maybe it's something like an ester with an alkene, or a ketone with an alkene.

The Mass Spectrometry data shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. What fragments give m/z=45? Well, common fragments include CH3CO+ (which is 43), but 45 is a bit higher. Wait, maybe it's a CH2O group? Because 45 is the molecular weight of CH2O (formaldehyde is 30, but wait, 45 is more like (12+2+16=30?) Wait, no, wait: C is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So CH2O would be 12+2+16=30. Hmm, but 45 is higher. Another possibility is a fragment like (CH2)2CO, but that's 58. Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH3CO-O- group. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, m/z=45 could correspond to a methyl group attached to something. Let me think: 45 is 12*(3) + 1*(6) + 16*(0) = 36 +6=42. No. Wait, wait. Let me calculate: 45 is the mass. So possible molecular formulas: C3H3O would be (12*3)+(1*3)+(16*1)=36+3+16=55. No. C2H5O2: (24)+(5)+(32)=61. No. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: common fragments. What about the tropylium ion? That's for benzene rings. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be from (CH3)2O, which is 45? No, (CH3)2O is 12*2 + 6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh, that's close but not exactly 45.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a CH2CHO group. Wait, CH2CHO would be 45? Let me see: the molecular formula would be C2H3O. That's 24 +3 +
