Okay, so I've got this question here about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The question is a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one construct. The vector has two ORFs (ligand and receptor), each with their own fluorescent markers (mCherry and eGFP) fused to them. Let me parse the vector structure.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3', and it's fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, so that would allow for internal ribosome entry, meaning the two ORFs can be expressed as separate proteins from the same mRNA. 

Wait, but there are these stop cassettes. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that these stop cassettes prevent the downstream gene from being expressed unless Cre is present to excise them. LoxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants, so Cre recombinase can only recognize one type. Oh, but wait, the Cre used is from the SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells.

So the idea is that when the Cre is expressed, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor would be under the IRES, but the stop cassette would prevent eGFP from being expressed. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The vector is set up so that the ligand is first, with its own promoter (CBA), followed by the ligand ORF, then the stop cassette, then
