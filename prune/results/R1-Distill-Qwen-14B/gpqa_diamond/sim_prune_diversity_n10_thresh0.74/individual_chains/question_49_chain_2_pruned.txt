Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions. I remember that pericyclic reactions involve concerted movements of electrons, such as in cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic shifts. In sigmatropic rearrangements, a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond, hence the name. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and they are usually thermodynamically controlled, meaning they favor the more stable product.

The problem has three separate reactions, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions. The options are given for each product, so I'll have to figure out each one individually and then match them.

Let's start with Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give A.

Hmm. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups. Wait, the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2. Or maybe more accurately, (HOCH2CH2OCH3)NH2? Wait, no. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: the ethanamine part is CH2CH2NH2, but the 1,1-dimethoxy would mean the oxygen is on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH2OCH3)2NH. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? No, wait, wait. Another way: the structure is (CH3O)2CHNH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is NH2-CH2-CH2-. The 1,1-dimethoxy would be two methoxy groups on the first carbon, so the structure is OCH3 is attached to the N? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-
