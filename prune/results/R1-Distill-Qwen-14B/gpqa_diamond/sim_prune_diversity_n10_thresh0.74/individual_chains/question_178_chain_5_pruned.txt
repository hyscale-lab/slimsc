Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those gamma matrices. So this looks like a term involving the field strength tensor F, which I remember is for gauge fields, probably electromagnetism or non-Abelian like in Yang-Mills.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian term.

The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime because the action is dimensionless, and the integral over d^4x contributes dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Wait, but L_int is an interaction term. Let's break down the dimensions of each component.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ (fermion) has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4D, the Dirac spinor ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄ would also be 3/2.

Now σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless (since they're just matrices, not operators with differential terms). So σ_{μν} would be dimensionless too.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of a gauge field. For electromagnetism, the gauge field A is a vector potential with dimension 1. F is the derivative of A, so each derivative ∂_μ gives dimension 1. So F has [F] = [∂ A] = (1) + (1) = 2? Wait, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each term is ∂ A, so dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F.

So the dimensions would be [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F].

Wait, wait, no. Because ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar. Let me think, ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. So the entire term is κ * (3) + [F] (which is 2) = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] + 5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4. So [κ] = -1.

Okay, so the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? To check that, I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants (like κ here) have non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. The coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimensions. Because if a coupling has negative dimension, it's a relevant operator and the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. In renormalization, the mass dimension of the coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence. For a term in the Lagrangian with coupling κ, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - Nκ, where Nκ is the mass dimension of κ.

Wait, no, more accurately, the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - (d - m) where m is the mass dimension of the interaction term. Or wait, another approach: each vertex contributes a factor of the coupling, and each field contributes its mass dimension. For each term in the Lagrangian, the total mass dimension of the term must be equal to 4 (in 4D).

But for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension should be ≥0. Because if [κ] is negative, that means that when you calculate the loops, the amplitude might have higher powers of momentum, leading to divergences which can't be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

Wait, another approach: a theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms in the Lagrangian have coupling constants with mass dimension ≥0. Because each coupling's dimension determines the possible superficial degree of divergence of Feynman diagrams. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the interaction term is of higher dimension, leading to superrenormalizable terms, but wait, no, superrenormalizable theories have couplings with positive dimensions, I think. Let me double-check.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence D
