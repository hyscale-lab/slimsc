Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's the state vector. Then there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by a 3x3 matrix. The problem is about measuring Q after measuring P and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Hmm, I remember that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the process would be: first measure P, which gives a value (here, 0), and then the state collapses into the corresponding eigenstate. Then measure Q on this new state, looking for the value -1. The probability is the product of each step's probability.

Wait, but no, not necessarily. Because the probabilities are multiplied only if the measurements are independent, but in this case, the state changes after the first measurement. So the overall probability is the probability of getting P=0 multiplied by the probability of getting Q=-1 given that the state is already in P=0's eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both P and Q.

Starting with operator P. The matrix for P is given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, what's the structure of this matrix? It looks like it's a symmetric matrix, so it should be diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. Maybe I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a spin operator or something similar. But maybe I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

Let me denote the matrix as P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

To find eigenvalues, solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ     1/sqrt(2)      0
1/sqrt(2)  -λ     1/sqrt(2)
0       1/sqrt(2)   -λ]

Hmm, I'll have to compute the determinant of this matrix. Since it's a 3x3, the determinant calculation might be a bit involved, but let me proceed.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- 1/sqrt(2) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 ) ]
+ 0 * (...) 

Wait, the third term would be zero, so only the first two terms matter.

First term: -λ [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ) ] because (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2.

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ) ] which is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ / sqrt(2)) ) = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ) / 2.

Wait, let me compute each part carefully.

So the determinant is:

= -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

So first part: -λ [ λ^2 - (1/2) ]

Second part: - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( - λ / sqrt(2) ) = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ) / 2.

So combining:

det = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2)

Wait, because (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (lambda * 1/2).

Then adding (lambda/2) gives:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

Factor out λ: λ(-λ² +1 ) =0 → λ(1 - λ²) =0 → λ=0 or λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Hmm,
