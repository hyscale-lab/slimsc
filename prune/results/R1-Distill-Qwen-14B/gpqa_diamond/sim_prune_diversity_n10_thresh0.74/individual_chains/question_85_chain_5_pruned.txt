Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets. Hmm, let's see what I remember about equilibrium temperatures. I think the formula involves the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and maybe some other factors like the planet's albedo. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25.

Wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. That's helpful. So I don't have to worry about that part.

The star's parameters are given: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff is 6300 K. The planets have different masses and radii, but I think for equilibrium temperature, the planet's radius doesn't matter—only the distance matters. So I need to find the distances of each planet from the star.

The question mentions both the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, right, the radial velocity method gives the mass of the planet and the distance based on the Doppler shift. The transit method gives the radius (from the size of the dip in brightness) and also the distance if you know the star's size and the orbital period.

Wait, but the problem gives us the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] for each planet. How does that relate to the velocity? I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which corresponds to the star's velocity towards or away from us. The shift is in Angstroms. So each planet's effect on the star's velocity is given by the shift.

The Doppler shift formula is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, the problem gives the shifts as up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03, so v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * c.

What's c? Speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s, but maybe exact values aren't needed since we're dealing with a ratio.
