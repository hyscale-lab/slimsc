Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a' in crystals, right? So a is 10 Angstrom here.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the spacing between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ), but wait, no, I might be mixing this up. Oh right, another formula comes to mind, which is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )? Or wait, maybe I should go back to the basics.

Wait, in a cubic system, like simple cubic, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k²+l²). But rhombohedral is more complex because the angles aren't 90 degrees. So the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system (like hexagonal, rhombohedral, etc.) is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact form of the equation. Alternatively, I remember that when all the angles are the same and the lattice is rhombohedral, maybe the formula simplifies a bit.

In a rhombohedral crystal, since all the angles are equal (and the edges are equal), the formula for d should take that into account. Let me think: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos α - 2 hl
