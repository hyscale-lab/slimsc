Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options: a, b, c, d. And the answer choices are A, B, C, D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The options a to d describe different planets, each with varying masses and radii or densities. The question is about which has the highest density. So I need to calculate or compare the densities of each planet as per their descriptions.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. The formula is density = mass / volume. Volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so density depends on both mass and radius.

Looking at each option:

Option a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its density is the same as Earth's. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So a has a density of 5.5.

Option b) 2 Earth masses, density ~5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait. The question says the planet has a density of approximately 5.5. So I don't need to compute it because it's given. So b's density is 5.5 as per the statement.

Option c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition would mean same density, right? Because composition affects density. But wait, if the mass is 5 times Earth's, and the composition is same, then the radius would be larger since mass scales with radius cubed (since volume is r³). Let me think. Mass is proportional to density times volume. So if composition is same, density is same. So if mass is 5x Earth's, since density is same, volume is 5x Earth's. Volume scales with r³, so the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So for this planet, mass is 5M_e, radius is (5)^(1/3) R_e ≈ 1.71 R_e. But density is same as Earth, so 5.5.

Option d) Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. Again, same density as Earth, because same composition. So density is 5.5. So d's density is 5.5.

Wait, wait. So options a, b, c, d: a has 5.
