Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions, specifically with bromine. The question is asking me to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after they undergo the reaction. Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents play a big role in determining where the bromine will add.

Let me list out the substances again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, I think I misread some of them. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, the structures are all benzene rings with different substituents. So each substituent will direct the incoming bromine either ortho/para or meta.

So, the key here is to determine for each substituent whether it's a strong activating (ortho/para) or deactivating (meta) group, and also whether it's a strong or weak director. Because the strength of the directing effect can influence the ratio of para to ortho products.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) CH3: Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So in toluene, the bromine will add primarily at the para and ortho positions. Since methyl is a strong activating group, the para isomer will be the major product, but ortho will also be significant.

2) COOEt (ethyl ester): The ester group is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So in ethyl benzoate, the bromine will add mainly at the meta position. So the para isomer should be less in this case.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a deactivating group due to being more electronegative (electron-withdrawing), but it's ortho/para-directing because of the lone pairs on chlorine. However, being deactivating, it's a weaker director, so the substitution is slower, and the para product might be less than in activating groups. Wait, but I think chlorobenzene tends to have more para substitution than meta because of the directing effect, but para might be the major? Or is it that the meta is more? Wait, no, I think when the substituent is deactivating but ortho/para-directing, the para product is the major. Wait, no, for nitro groups, which are strong deactivating and meta-directing, you get meta substitution. But for Cl, which is ortho/para, but weak deactivating, the substitution is para more than ortho? Or the opposite? Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For chlorobenzene, the major product is para, but also ortho. Wait, but the activating groups increase the rate, but Cl is deactivating so it's slower. Wait, but the directing effect is ortho/para,
