Okay, so I've got this physics problem to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about atomic nucleus fission and calculating kinetic energy differences between relativistic and classical approximations. I remember from my studies that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and energy is released. But wait, this problem gives some specific numbers, so I need to pay attention.

The initial nucleus has a mass M and is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other. Oh, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So wait, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, but after fission, the sum is 0.99*M, which would be 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV? Because the rest mass after fission is less than before, right? Because some mass is converted into kinetic energy or other forms.

So the fragments' rest masses add up to 99% of the original. Let me denote the smaller fragment's mass as m. Then the larger one would be 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M → 3m = 0.99 * 300 GeV → m = (0.99 * 300) / 3 GeV. Let me calculate that: 0.99 *300 is 297, divided by 3 is 99 GeV. So m is 99 GeV, and the larger fragment is 198 GeV. So the initial mass was 300 GeV, and the two fragments sum to 297. So the mass difference is 3 GeV. That's the mass converted into kinetic energy or other things, like binding energy or maybe neutrinos or something. But for this problem, perhaps we can assume that all the mass difference goes into kinetic energy. Wait, but in reality, some energy goes into other forms too, but maybe the problem simplifies it.

So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions so that their momenta cancel each other out. Because momentum is conserved. So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So we need to find T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation.

Wait, the problem says to find the difference (T1 correct - T1 classical), or the other way around? Wait, the question says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So it's correct minus classical. So if the correct is higher, then the difference is positive, but if the classical overestimates, then it could be negative. Hmm, but I think in relativistic cases, for high speeds, the classical approximation (which uses non-relativistic KE formulas) is less accurate. So probably the correct KE is higher.

Wait, but the exact setup is that the nucleus is at rest, so the two fragments
