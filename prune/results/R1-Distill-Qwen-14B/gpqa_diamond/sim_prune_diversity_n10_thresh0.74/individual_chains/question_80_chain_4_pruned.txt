Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm gives for the input ACAGTGACC. The examples provided are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I'll list out the inputs and outputs to see if I can find a pattern. 

AGG becomes 115. Let's break down AGG. Each letter is a nucleotide: A, G, G. The output is 115. TGCTGA is the next input, which gives 176. So, I need to figure out how these sequences translate into numbers.

I remember that each nucleotide has a certain weight. Maybe each has a numerical value assigned. Let me think: A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Wait, or maybe it's different. Let me try that and see if it fits.

Taking the first example: AGG. If A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So adding them up: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But the output is 115. 9 doesn't match 115, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe each nucleotide's position has a weight. Like, maybe it's a sum of each nucleotide multiplied by its position or something.

Wait, another thought: maybe each nucleotide is converted to its position in the alphabet. So A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Wait, no, that can't be right because G is the 7th letter, but that seems a stretch. Let me calculate.

For AGG: A is 1, G is 7, G is 7. Sum is 1+7+7=15. Not 115. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a value based on the number of letters from A. So A is 1, T is 20 (since T is the 20th letter?), wait no, T is the 20th letter of the English alphabet. Wait, but in DNA, the letters are A, T, C, G. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait another idea: Maybe it's based on the molecular weight of each nucleotide. Let me think. The molecular weight of each base is: 

A
