Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field falls off as 1/r² radially. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, that's the divergence theorem! So the integral of the divergence of f over the volume should equal the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

Wait, the problem says that the vector field has only a radial component and it's given by f(r) = 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field f is (1/r²) r̂, because it's radial. So the field only has the r-component and it's F_r = 1/r², others are zero.

Now, to find the divergence of f. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is given by (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr + r sinθ d(A_θ)/dθ + r d(A_φ)/dφ ]. But since our field only has A_r, the other terms are zero. So divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) d(r² (1/r²))/dr.

Let me compute that. Let's see:
