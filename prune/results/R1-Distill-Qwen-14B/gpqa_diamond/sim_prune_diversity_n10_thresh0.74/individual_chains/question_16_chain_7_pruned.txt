Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality—so it has a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. 

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Since the double bond is at position 1, the substituents are Cl, CH3, and two CH2 groups. The molecule is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. But wait, for a double bond to have geometric isomerism (Z or E), each carbon in the double bond must have two different substituents. In this case, C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let's draw it. Structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a CH3 and another CH2 group. Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents on each double bond carbon. 

C1: Cl and two Hs (since it's 1-chloro). Wait, but wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the formula is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is Cl-CR²=CR². Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Oh no wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So structure: Cl-C(=CH(CH3))CH2. Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's Cl-C(=CH-CH2CH3)-CH3? No, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons.
