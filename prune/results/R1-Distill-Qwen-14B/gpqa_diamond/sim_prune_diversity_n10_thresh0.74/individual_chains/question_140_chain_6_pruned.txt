Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. It's violent, so maybe an acid-base reaction or something exothermic. Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. If the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, perhaps it's a noble gas? Or maybe a diatomic molecule?

Wait, if W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, the molecule's formula might be something like H2O (but H and O have different proton and neutron counts). Or maybe CO2? Let me calculate possible atoms.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule like O2 or N2. Let's see. For example, oxygen has 8 protons. If the molecule is O2, each O has 8p, 8n (since O's atomic number is 8, and common isotopes have 8 or 9 neutrons). So O2 would have 16p and 16n per molecule. That fits the same number of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, could it be another diatomic gas? Like maybe Cl2? Chlorine has 17 protons. If the molecule is Cl2, each Cl atom has 17p and 35n (for the common isotope Cl-35). But then Cl2 would have 34p and 70n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, for W's molecule, the count is per molecule. So if each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible atoms.

Carbon has 6 protons. If the molecule
