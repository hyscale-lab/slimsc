Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry and whether they are necessary.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. I remember that in the Standard Model, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry. Effective theories like SMEFT typically must respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory. Since the Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, SMEFT operators should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one that must be respected. So that's symmetry 1, which is option 1.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Lorentz invariant, does it automatically respect Poincare? I think that for a relativistic field theory, Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. But SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it's applicable when the energy is much below the cutoff scale. Wait, but for the operators in SMEFT, the theory is built such that all operators are consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Poincare. So must SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, I
