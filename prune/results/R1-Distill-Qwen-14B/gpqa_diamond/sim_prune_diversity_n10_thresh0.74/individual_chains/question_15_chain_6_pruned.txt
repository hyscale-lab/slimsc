Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, meaning they're similar in size to Earth. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Transit method is when the planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness.

They've already detected both via the RV method, which tells us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have same masses, so that doesn't affect this. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period means closer orbit if the star's mass is the same. But wait, the host stars have different masses.

Wait, the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2. Oh, and both stars have the same radius. Hmm, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So the host stars have the same size, but Planet_1's star is more massive.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability to transit, so higher probability of being aligned such that it passes in front from our view. The probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, I think the probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in some way) to the star's radius. Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually ( R_*/ a ) * ( (R_p + R_*) / R_* ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_*/ a) * (some factor), but I think more accurately, it's (R_*)/(a) * (something). Wait, no, perhaps it's ( (R_p + R_*) ) / (a) but that can't be right because if a is much larger than R_*, that would be tiny. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/ a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, which is a function of the inclination. Wait, no, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is edge-on enough to cause a transit. The probability is given by the formula P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but wait, more accurately, the probability is the ratio (R_* / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the transit occurs. Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_*/ a) * (1/(sin i)), but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_*/ a) multiplied by the term (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), which accounts for eccentricity, but in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so eccentricity e is zero. So that term becomes 1.

So the main factor is (R_*/a). But wait, R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So a higher a (planet is farther from the star) would make the probability lower, because it's less likely that the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. So the probability is inversely proportional to a.

But wait, the host stars have the same radius, right? So R_* is same for both stars. So the transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So the closer the planet is to its star, the higher the probability.

But wait, the other factor is the star's mass. Because the orbital period depends on both the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. Using Kepler's third law, which in the Newtonian form is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) a³. But since the planets are Earth-like (so M_p << M_*, which is already much larger), we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So P² ∝ a³ / M_*.

So for each planet, a can be calculated based on their period and the star's mass. Our goal is to find a for each planet, then compute (R_*/ a), because the transit probability is proportional to that.

Given that, let's compute a for Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Planet_1's period, P1 = P2 / 3. Because its period is three times shorter. Let's denote P2 as the period of Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³ / M_*, so a³ = (P² * M_*) / (4π²), but for our purposes, the exact constant doesn't matter because we're taking ratios.

So for Planet_1: a1³ = ( (P1)^2 * M_*1 ) 
But M_*1 is twice M_*2, since M_*1 = 2 M_*2.

Similarly, for Planet_2: a2³ = (P2^2 * M_*2).

Take the ratio a1 / a2: 

(a1³) / (a2³) = [ (P1² * M_*1) ] / [ (P2² * M_*2) ) ]
But P1 = P2 /3, so P1² = P2²/9.

M_*1 = 2 M_*2.

So (a1³)/(a2³) = ( (P2²/9) * 2 M_*2 ) / ( P2² * M_*2 ) )
Simplify numerator: (P2² * 2 M_*2 ) /9
Denominator: (P2² * M_*2 )

So the ratio is (2/9) * ( P2² M_*2 ) / (9 P2² M_*2 ) → wait, no, let me compute correctly.

Wait, the ratio a1³ / a2³ is [ ( (P2²/9) * 2 M_*2 ) ] / [ ( P2² * M_*2 ) ]

So: ( ( (P2^2) * 2 M_*2 ) /9 ) ) / ( P2² M_*2 )

Divide numerator and denominator: (2/9) / 1 → 2/9.

So a1³ / a2³ = 2/9 → (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a
