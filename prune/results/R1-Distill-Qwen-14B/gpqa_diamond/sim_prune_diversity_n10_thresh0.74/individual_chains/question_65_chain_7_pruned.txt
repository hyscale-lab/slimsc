Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these mechanisms. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through this step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each with a starting material and reaction conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with Reaction A:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and H+. Hmm. I remember that THF is tetrahydrofuran, a common solvent. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. Wait, but then there's an H+ added, so maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid workup?

Wait, another thought: in some cases, when you have a cyclic ether or a ring structure with a spiro arrangement, certain reactions can lead to annulations or ring-forming reactions. Since the starting material is a spiro alcohol, maybe it's a pinacol-type rearrangement or some kind of elimination.

Wait, pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols. But here we have a spiro structureâ€”so perhaps it's more about a hydride shift or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, if there's a strong base, like KH in THF, it might deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, maybe an elimination occurs to form a double bond, but the structure seems a bit complex.

Alternatively, I'm recalling something about vinylic alcohols. The starting material has a vinyl group attached to the spiro alcohol. When you have a spiro system, the molecule has two rings connected at a single atom. So in this case, maybe the reaction involves some kind of ring-opening or ring-forming.

Wait, another possibility: the spiro alcohol under strong base conditions might undergo an E2 elimination. But the starting material has a double bond already, so maybe that's not it. Or perhaps the base induces a rearrangement. Oh, wait! I'm thinking of the Cope elimination or some other type of elimination that forms a conjugated diene or a ring.

Wait, but with an alcohol group adjacent to a double bond, perhaps an elimination could form a ring. Another thought: when a spiro alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, it might deprotonate the less substituted position to form an alkoxide, which could then attack a neighboring carbon, leading to ring formation. Wait, could it be a Claisen or Aldol-like condensation? But those usually require either enolates or carb
