Okay, so I have this genetics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, the problem is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they're looking at the changes in the gene sequence. The question is asking which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, the intact gene sequence is given, and then there are four mutants. I need to compare each mutant to the intact gene to see which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby possibly eliminating the compound.

Wait, anti-nutritional compounds are often proteins, so the gene probably codes for a protein. If the gene's function is disrupted, the compound won't be made. So I'm looking for a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a frameshift.

Let me look at each mutant's sequences. The target is the first exon area. So the mutations are in the beginning of the gene.

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, let me compare. The first few nucleotides are:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes occur. Let's break down the sequences.

Looking at the same positions:

Intact: positions 1-40 or so.

Mutant 1: Let's see, the first part is ATGTTCTA... Hmm, wait, the intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT... So let me see:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So in Mutant1, the first part is ATGTTCTA. Wait, let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, looking at the third codon. Intact is CTC (which is Leu), Mutant1 is CTA (which is Leu as well). Then, the next codon for intact is GCT (Ala), Mutant1 has CGC (Arg). So that changes an Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation. So the amino acid changes from Ala to Arg. But that might not be enough to cause a problem unless it's in a critical
