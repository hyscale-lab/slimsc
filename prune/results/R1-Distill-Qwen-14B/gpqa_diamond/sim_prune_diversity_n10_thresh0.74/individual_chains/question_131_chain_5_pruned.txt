Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid, dehydration to an anhydride, and then a reaction with a cyclopentadiene derivative. The products' NMR spectra are then analyzed.

First, let me read the question carefully.

So the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm, 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons or maybe something like an enol, but in an anhydride? Wait, anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, but maybe the protons are part of a conjugated system. 

The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let's think about what these could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl. Wait, carbonyl carbons are usually higher, like around 170-220 ppm. Oh wait, 137 might be a carbon attached to an oxygen, like an sp2 hybridized carbon next to a carbonyl. The 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon itself. So the anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are connected, and the 13C spectrum shows two signals because perhaps the two carbonyls are equivalent. Wait, but an anhydride would have two carbonyls, but if the structure is symmetric, they might be the same. So the 13C has two peaks: one for the carbonyl (maybe 165) and another for the adjacent carbons (137).

The anhydride is then reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That molecule has two double bonds, I think. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene
