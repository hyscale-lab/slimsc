Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds mean we need to use special relativity equations, right?

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction. So, when we talk about their relative speed, it's about how fast one is moving relative to the other, not relative to the stationary frame.

I remember that in special relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like you do in classical mechanics. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, wait, I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)) when you're finding the velocity of one object from the perspective of another. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed?

Wait, so if I'm astronaut A, moving at 0.6c, then I see B moving at what speed? Let me plug into the formula. So u is 0.6c (A's speed), and v is B's speed, which is 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the denominator first. (0.6*0.5 c²)/c² = 0.3, so denominator is 1-0.3=0.7. Numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which is around 1/7 of the speed of light. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that narrows it down.

Now,
