Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid), which I remember is an oxidizing agent commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes. So the chemist is treating (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA each, then aqueous acid, and then combining the products. Then, they run the mixture on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one.

Wait, what's the deal with each reaction? Let's break it down.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. I remember that mCPBA epoxidizes alkenes. The reaction is stereospecific, right? So the geometry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.

For an (E) alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it creates an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide would depend on the starting geometry.

Similarly, Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. The substituents are on the same side. Treating that with mCPBA would give a different epoxide configuration.

Wait, but after mCPBA, they treat with aqueous acid. Oh right, that's the acid workup, which probably opens the epoxide. I think the ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions leads to diols.

So in each case, the starting alkene is epoxidized, then the epoxide is hydrolyzed to form a vicinal diol. So let me imagine the structures.

The starting alkenes are oct-4-ene, so four carbons from each end. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond, but the substituents (the two CH2CH3 groups) are opposite each other. Wait, no: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3, but wait, no. Let me draw it correctly.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, no. Wait, octene has 8 carbons. So oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, but maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not right. Oh, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.

Oct-4-ene is an alkene with 8 carbons, double bond between C4 and C5. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe it's (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene, so the substituents
