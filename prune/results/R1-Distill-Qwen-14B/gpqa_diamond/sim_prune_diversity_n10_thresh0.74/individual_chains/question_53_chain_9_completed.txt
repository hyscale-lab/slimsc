Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, meaning it's something like a benzene ring with two substituents.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Oh right, esters typically have a strong absorption around 1740-1760 cm^-1, which is the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the molecule has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Two for aromatic protons, two for vinyl protons, and two for methyl groups. And there's no signal for CH2 groups. Hmm, so what does that mean?

First, the aromatic protons. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be equivalent and give a single peak. But wait, in this case, there are two signals, so that suggests that the substituents are not in the para positions. Maybe they're in the ortho or meta positions. Or perhaps one substituent is a strong electron-withdrawing group that deshields the protons differently. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring isn't symmetrical, leading to two different types of aromatic protons.

Wait, but wait, a di-substituted benzene has possible substitution patterns: para, ortho, meta. For para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two equivalent protons (if substituents are identical) or perhaps no symmetry. Wait, no, if it's para and the substituents are the same, then the ring is symmetric, so the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a single peak. But in the case of different substituents, the ring might have more than one set of aromatic protons. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a meta arrangement, which would cause the ring to have two types of aromatic protons. For example, in meta substitution, the ring has two different environments for the protons adjacent to each substituent.

But I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's move on to the other parts of the NMR. There are two signals for vinyl protons. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or part of a substituent group. For vinyl protons, coupling can lead to doublets or more complex splitting. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet of quartets means the proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. Maybe that's in a conjugated system or part of a substituent with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but the NMR says there are no signals for CH2 groups. So any CH2 groups in the molecule must be either not present or their protons are not detectable, which is unlikely. So the molecule probably doesn't have any CH2 groups. That suggests that any substituents with CH2 are not present. So substituents like ethyl groups (which have CH2) can't be part of the structure.

Wait, but the ester group is present. An ester is typically R-O-CO-R'. So maybe it's part of a substituent on the benzene ring. For example, an ester group could be like -O-CO-R. Suppose the substituent is an ester group, which is O-CO-R, where R could be an alkyl group. But wait, if R is a methyl group, then the ester would be -O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's something like -O-CO-CH2CH3 or something else. But wait, the NMR has signals for -CH3 groups. Two signals, each for a CH3. So maybe there are two different methyl groups in the molecule.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene are two groups. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is another group with a CH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, but I'm not sure. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl protons. So maybe one substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2=CH- group, but wait, that would have more than two protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond adjacent to the ring, like a styryl group (like CH2=CH-O- attached to the ring), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a methoxy group, but wait, the IR said ester, so the other substituent could be something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O-R or R-O-CO-R'? No, ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' can be different. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a methyl group or another group.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for CH3 groups. So maybe the substituents are an ester (like O-CO-R) where R is a methyl group, and another substituent that's a methyl group. But wait, if the substituents are O-CO-CH3 and CH3, then the benzene ring would have two substituents: one is the ester group (maybe as O-CO-CH3), and the other is a methyl group.

Wait, but that would make the molecule an ortho, meta, or para substituted with these two groups. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems unlikely since the IR shows an ester, not multiple esters. Or maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, but let's go back to the NMR. Vinyl protons: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. So maybe the substituent has a CH2-CH2 group, but wait, no, because there are no CH2 signals. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-... No, that would have CH2 groups, which would show up in the NMR, but they don't. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, like a styryl group, but without any CH2 in between.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group, but that's CH2CH2CH2, which would have CH2 protons, but the NMR doesn't show any. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and another is a methoxy group, but that doesn't explain the CH3 signals. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group, and the vinyl group has two adjacent protons that are split into a doublet and another with more splitting. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2- something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that's in the ester. Let me think about the structure more.

Wait, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring. Let's say substituent A is an ester group, and substituent B is a vinyl group attached to the ring. Or maybe substituent B is a methyl group.

Wait, let me count the possible protons. The aromatic protons: if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two equivalent protons, giving a single peak. But here, we have two signals, so maybe the substituents are in the meta position. Alternatively, if substituents are different, even in para, they could cause the ring to have two different sets of aromatic protons.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a bulky group that causes the ring to have two different types of protons. For example, a substituent like -O-CO-OCH2CH3 (an ester) and a methyl group.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. If the substituents are an ester and a methyl group, then the substituents could be in positions that create two different sets of aromatic protons.

Let me try to imagine the structure. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (like -O-CO-R), and the other is a methyl group. Let's say the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Then the aromatic protons would be in two different environments, giving two signals.

The ester group would have -O-CO-R, where R might be a methyl group. So the ester substituent would be -O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is an alkyl group, say CH3, then the substituent would be O-CO-CH3, which is a methyl ester.

Wait, if the substituents are -O-CO-CH3 (ester) and -CH3 (methyl), then the ring would have two substituents. Let's say they're in the para position relative to each other. Then the ring's aromatic protons would be in two different environments, giving two signals. Alternatively, if they are in the meta position, the situation would be different.

Wait, but if substituent A is -O-CO-CH3 and substituent B is -CH3, and they're in the para position, then the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. But wait, in the para positions, the substituents are across from each other. Let me draw a benzene ring with substituents in positions 1 and 4. Then the H's in positions 2,3,5,6 would be in two sets. Positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent (if substituents are same, but in this case substituents are different). Wait, substituents are different, so perhaps the ring isn't symmetric, leading to two distinct aromatic proton environments, like positions 2 and 6 being one type, and positions 3 and 5 being another. But that would mean two signals for aromatic protons, which matches the NMR data.

So substituent A is -O-CO-CH3 (ester group) and substituent B is -CH3 (methyl group), para to each other. Then, the aromatic protons would give two signals.

But wait, what about the vinyl signals? The NMR shows two signals for vinyl H. So substituents must have some vinyl groups. Wait, the ester substituent is O-CO-CH3, which doesn't have any vinyl protons. So the other substituent must have a vinyl group.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, like -CH2-CH2- something. Or perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond, like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that would have CH2 groups, which we don't have. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl group, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl group, but that's a benzene ring, which doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the benzene ring, like styrene. So substituent B is a vinyl group, like CH2=CH- attached to the ring. But wait, that would have two vinyl protons, which are adjacent. So in the NMR, each vinyl proton would split into a doublet. But in the NMR, there are two signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that fits with a vinyl group that is adjacent to another group. For example, if the substituent is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that brings back CH2 groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a vinyl group. So maybe the substituent is a ketone or something else, but that doesn't fit with the ester.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a substituted ester. Like, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, such as -O-CO-CH2-CH2-O- something. No, not sure.

Alternatively, substituent A is -O-CO-CH2-CH3 (ethyl ester), and substituent B is a vinyl group. But then, substituent A would have ethyl groups, which have CH2, but the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester, so substituent A is -O-CO-CH3. Then substituent B must be a group that contributes to the vinyl and methyl signals without CH2. Let me think.

So substituent B has to have a vinyl group and a methyl group without any CH2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps substituent B is a methyl group, and substituent A is a vinyl ester. Like, substituent A is -O-CO-CH2-CH2- something, but that brings back CH2 groups. Alternatively, substituent A is -CO-O-CH2-CH2-O- something, but again CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe substituent A is a vinyl group, and substituent B is an ester group attached to a methyl. Let me think: substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3? No, that would have CH2.

Alternatively, substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that's introducing CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester, like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2- something, but that introduces CH2 groups again.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the NMR again.

Vinyl protons: two signals, one a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let's imagine a substituent where one proton is split into a doublet, and another is a doublet of quartets. That suggests that the protons are adjacent to two different environments.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the ring. But that would have CH2 groups, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, so it's like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Wait, that would be an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but no, that brings back CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-O- something else. I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a cyclopropane ring or something, but that's probably not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but that's a phenyl group attached via a CH2, which would introduce a CH2, but the NMR doesn't have CH2 signals.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), and substituent B is a CH3 group. But then, substituent B is a methyl group attached directly to the ring.

In that case, the substituents would be a methyl ester and a methyl group. If the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets, giving two signals.

But where do the vinyl protons come into play? Because the NMR shows two signals for vinyl protons, which suggests that one of the substituents has a vinyl group.

Wait, maybe substituent A is a vinyl ester. Like, substituent A is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is the ester. Let's say substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3. But again, that brings in CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3, but that would have two CH2 groups, and the NMR shows no CH2 signals. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a vinyl group attached via a single bond. So substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3, but again, CH2 groups are present and not observed, which is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a propenyl group. Like, substituent A is -CH2-CH=CH2. But that would have CH2 groups, which are not in the NMR. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, substituent A is a vinyl group directly attached to the ring, like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3. But again, that's CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a geminal di-substituted group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is an ester group and substituent B is a vinyl group. But how would that structure look?

Wait, substituent A is a vinyl group. For example, substituent A is -CH2-CH2-O-CO-CH3. But that brings CH2 into the structure, which isn't present in the NMR. So that can't be.

Alternatively, substituent A is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, like -CH2-CH2-O-CO-R, but that brings CH2 again.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The unknown has an ester group, which is O and a carbonyl. Let's think about the structure.

Each substituent on the benzene ring would contribute some number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.

If substituent A is an ester group, say O-CO-O-R, but wait, that's a carbonate, not an ester. Ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for an ester substituent, let's say substituent A is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

If R is methyl, then substituent A is O-CO-CH3. That's a methyl ester. So substituent A contributes 3 carbons (O-CO-CH3: 3 carbons including the ester oxygen). Wait, no, the structure is O-CO-R. For R as methyl, it's O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent is O-CO-R', where R' is an alkyl group. So substituent A would be O-CO-R', where R' is, say, methyl. So substituent A is O-CO-OCH3? No, that's a carbonate. Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent A is O-CO-R' where R' is a group attached to the oxygen. Wait, no, substituent A is R-O-CO-R', but attached to the benzene. So for example, substituent A could be CH3-O-CO- attached to the benzene. Then the group would be O-CO-OCH3 if it's a methyl ester. Wait, no, substituent A would be R-O-CO-R', so if R is attached to the benzene, it's R-O-CO-R'. So if R is an alkyl group, like ethyl, then substituent A is ethyl ester.

But let's think about the molecular formula.

Benzene has 6 carbons. Each substituent adds more.

Suppose substituent A is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester). That adds 3 carbons (O, C, O, CH3?), wait, no: substituent A is O-CO-CH3. So that's 3 carbons (COOCH3), but that's a group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, O-CO-CH3 is the ester group: it's O connected to CO, which is connected to CH3.

So substituent A is O-CO-CH3, which is a group with 3 atoms (O, C, O, CH3?), wait, no. Structure of ester substituent: O-CO-CH3, so the substituent is O-CO-CH3 attached to the benzene. That's a group with 3 carbons (the benzene ring is 6, substituent is 3: O, C, O, CH3? Wait, no, the structure is O-CO-CH3. So the substituent adds 3 carbons: the COO and the CH3.

Wait, substituent A would contribute 3 carbons (COOCH3 is the substituent), and substituent B could be a methyl group (CH3), which contributes 1 carbon.

So benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a H, so two substituents would make the benzene part C6H4.

So substituent A: COOCH3 (3 carbons, 3 oxygen? Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which is a methoxy group connected to a carbonyl and methyl. Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3. So that's a methoxycarbonyl group.

So substituent A is O-CO-CH3: that's 3 carbons (COOCH3?), wait no.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-CH3. So it's a group with 3 atoms: O connected to CO, which is connected to CH3. So the substituent contributes 3 carbons (the COO and the CH3), but wait, the COO is two oxygen and two carbons, plus the CH3.

Wait, the structure of an ester substituent is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent A is R-O-CO-R', where R is attached to the benzene. For example, if R is methyl, then substituent A is methyl ester: CH3-O-CO-R', but R' would be another group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester). But then R' is ethyl, adding two more carbons.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently.

Let me calculate the molecular formula based on the options.

The compound has an ester group, so it must have at least two oxygen atoms. So the formula is C?H?O2.

The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Assume substituent A is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), which has 3 carbons (COOCH3). Substituent B is CH3. So the benzene ring has substituents A and B.

Substituent A: COOCH3 has 3 carbons, substituent B: CH3 has 1 carbon.

Benzene has 6 carbons, so total carbons: 6 + 3 + 1 = 10.

Wait, but the options start at C11. Hmm. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (but that would have more carbons). Wait, substituent A is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (CH2CH3). So substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3). So substituent A contributes 3 carbons, substituent B is CH3 (1 carbon), benzene is 6.

Total carbons: 6 +3 +1 =10. Again, not matching options.

Hmm. Maybe substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's longer), but that would have more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a vinyl group attached to an ester.

Wait, maybe substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. But that would add more carbons and possibly CH2 groups.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2-O- something. Not sure.

Wait, maybe substituent A is a benzyl ester. So substituent A is Ph-O-CO-R, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is part of a larger ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Then R could be methyl. So substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

That would contribute 5 carbons (the CH2=CH, O, COOCH3), but wait, let's count:

CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3: the CH2=CH is 2 carbons, O is one, COOCH3 is another 3 carbons (the carbonyl and the two oxygens plus the methyl). Wait, no, COOCH3 is three carbons in total (COO is two, but the methyl is one). So substituent A: 2 (CH2=CH) + 3 (COOCH3) = 5 carbons.

Substituent B is CH3, contributing 1 carbon.

Benzene:6.

Total carbons:6 +5 +1=12.

So the formula would be C12H?O2.

Looking at the options, option C is C12H12O2, and option B is C12H14O2.

So how about the hydrogens?

Let's calculate the hydrogen count.

Benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a hydrogen.

Substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

Breaking down substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

The structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

So substituent A has:

CH2=CH-: 2 H (on CH2 and CH) ? Wait, no:

CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3: The CH2 has two H, the CH has one H (but it's double bonded, so actually, the CH2=CH group has two H on CH2 and one on CH, but the CH is part of the double bond, so it's actually CH2=CH-.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has 3 H: two on CH2 and one on CH (but CH is double bonded, so no H? Wait, no, the CH2=CH- group has two H on CH2 and one H on CH, because the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, no. The structure would be CH2=CH-O-COCH3.

So the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which has two H on the CH2 and one H on the CH (but wait, the CH is part of the double bond, so it doesn't have any H attached. Because in CH2=CH-, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, but the CH has no H attached because it's double bonded to C1 and connected to O.

Wait, no. The CH2=CH- group would have the CH2 (with 2 H) and the CH (with 1 H, since it's connected to O-CO-CH3).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's draw it.

Structure: benzene ring with substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

So the substituent is attached to the benzene via the O. So the structure is O connected to CH2=CH- and to CO-CH3.

So the substituent is O linked to CH2=CH- and COCH3. So the structure is O-CO-CH3 connected via the O to the CH2=CH- group.

Wait, no, the substituent is O-CO-CH3 attached to the benzene, and the CH2=CH group is attached to the same oxygen? No, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

So the substituent is a glycidyl group attached to the benzene via the oxygen.

So, substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

So the substituent has 5 carbons: CH2=CH (2 C), O, CO (2 C), CH3 (1 C). Wait, no: substituent is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. So:

CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

So that's:

CH2=CH (2 C) connected to O, which is connected to COO-CH3 (which is another 3 C: COO is two C and CH3 is one).

So substituent A: 2 (CH2=CH) + 3 (O-CO-CH3)= 5 C.

Substituent B: CH3, which is 1 C.

Benzene:6 C.

Total: 6+5+1=12 C.

So the formula would be C12H?O2.

Now, let's count the hydrogens.

Benzene has 6 H normally, but with two substituents, each replacing a H, so 6-2=4 H on the ring.

Substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

Breaking this down:

CH2=CH-O-: CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H (but wait, the CH is double bonded, so no H? No, the CH is connected to O, but in the structure, the CH would have one H because it's part of the double bond.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

The CH2=CH- group has two H on CH2 and one H on CH (since it's CH2=CH-O-). So that's 3 H.

Then, the O-CO-CH3 group: the COOCH3 group. The COOCH3 has no H attached except the CH3, which has 3 H.

So substituent A contributes 3 (from CH2=CH) + 3 (from CH3) = 6 H.

Substituent B is CH3, which contributes 3 H.

So total H:

Benzene ring:4.

Substituent A:6.

Substituent B:3.

Total H:4+6+3=13.

Wait, but the molecular formula would be C12H13O2? But that's not an option. The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Hmm. So that suggests that my assumption might be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester). Then substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which contributes 4 carbons (COOCH2CH2CH3: 3 carbons in COO and one in the ester group?), maybe not. Let me recount.

Wait, O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: the COO is two carbons, and the CH2CH2CH3 is three carbons. So substituent A: 2 (COO) +3 (CH2CH2CH3)=5? Wait, no. O-CO- is two O's and two C's (the O-C-O part?), no, the O is connected to the COO group.

Wait, substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the ester is O-CO- connected to a propyl group. So substituent A has 3 carbons in the propyl group plus the COO (which is two O's but not more carbons beyond the COO). Wait, COO is two carbons (the carbonyl and the oxygen), but the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the substituent brings in 3 carbons from the CH2CH2CH3, plus the COO (two C) but the COO is part of the substituent.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: O connected to CO, which is connected to CH2CH2CH3. So substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

That's 3 carbons from the ester (COO) and 3 from the propyl (CH2CH2CH3), but wait, the COO is part of the ester, so substituent A adds 3 (propyl) + 3 (COO) =6 carbons? No, because the COO is part of the ester group attached to the benzene. The substituent is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which has 3 carbons in the ester (COO) and 3 in the propyl (CH2CH2CH3), so 6 carbons. But the benzene is 6, substituent A is 6, substituent B is 1. Total 6+6+1=13 C. That's even worse.

Hmm. Maybe substituent A is a methyl ester, and substituent B is a vinyl group.

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-CH3 (3 C), substituent B: CH2=CH- (2 C). So substituent B is CH2=CH-, attached to the ring.

But substituent B would be CH2=CH- attached to the ring, which has two C. So benzene is 6, substituent A:3, substituent B:2. Total 6+3+2=11 C.

So the formula would be C11H?O2.

Now, let's count hydrogens.

Benzene: 6 H normally, with two substituents, so 6-2=4 H.

Substituent A: O-CO-CH3. This group has CH3 (3 H) and the rest (O-CO-) doesn't add any H.

Substituent B: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. The CH2=CH- group has two H on CH2 and one H on CH (but wait, the CH is part of the double bond, so no H. So only two H from CH2.

Wait, the substituent B is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is CH2=CH- attached to the benzene. The CH2 has two H, the CH is double bonded, so no H attached. So substituent B contributes two H.

So total H:

Ring:4.

Substituent A:3.

Substituent B:2.

Total:4+3+2=9 H.

But the formula is C11H9O2, which isn't an option. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a CH3 group, and substituent A is a vinyl ester.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3. Then substituent A is a vinyl ester group.

So substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

That's 5 carbons (CH2=CH is 2, O is 1, COO is 2, CH3 is 1). So substituent A: 5 C.

Substituent B: CH3 (1 C).

Benzene:6 C.

Total C:6+5+1=12.

Hydrogen count:

Ring:6-2=4.

Substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

CH2=CH has 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH (but since it's double bonded, the CH has one H). So 3 H.

O-CO-CH3: the CH3 has 3 H.

So substituent A:3+3=6 H.

Substituent B: CH3, which has 3 H.

Total H:4+6+3=13.

Again, not matching the options.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a different group. Let me think about the NMR again. Two vinyl H signals.

One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets.

In a vinyl group, each proton is typically a doublet because they couple with each other. But in the case of a substituent like CH2=CH- attached to something else, perhaps the coupling is more complicated.

Wait, suppose substituent A is CH2=CH-O- attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester group (O-CO-CH3). Then substituent A would have a CH2=CH-O- group.

In that case, the CH2 protons would be adjacent to the O, and the CH would be attached to the O.

Wait, but then substituent A would be CH2=CH-O-. So the structure would be CH2=CH-O- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but substituent A would then have a CH2=CH-O- group, connected to the benzene.

In that case, substituent A's structure is CH2=CH-O- attached to the ring. That would have two H on CH2 and one H on CH. So CH2=CH-O-: the CH2 has two H, the CH has one H. But the CH is attached to O, so perhaps its coupling is with the O?

Wait, more accurately, the vinyl protons in CH2=CH-O- would be as follows:

The CH2 protons (let's say H1 and H2) would each couple with the adjacent CH proton (H3), and perhaps with any other protons nearby. But since the CH is attached to O, which is attached to the benzene, there might be no further coupling.

But I'm not sure about the splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 protons are each a doublet of quartets, and the CH proton is a doublet.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets. So perhaps one proton is a doublet and the other is a quartet. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a group where the vinyl protons are split by adjacent groups. For example, substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, which is a vinyl ester.

In that case, the CH2 protons (on CH2=CH) would be adjacent to O, which is attached to COOCH3. So the CH2 protons would split into a quartet or something else because of coupling with the adjacent CH and possibly other protons.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH2-CH3, but that brings in more CH2 groups, which are not present.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

The options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Assuming the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-) and another is a methyl group.

So substituent A: O-CO-R, where R is methyl (O-CO-CH3, 3 C), substituent B: CH3 (1 C). Benzene:6 C. Total C:6+3+1=10. Not matching any options.

So perhaps substituent A is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (O-CO-CH2CH3, 4 C). Substituent B: CH3 (1 C). Total C:6+4+1=11. So formula would be C11H?O2.

Now, let's count H.

Benzene:6-2=4 H.

Substituent A: O-CO-CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3: 2+3=5 H). Wait, wait, substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3. The ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent A is R-O-CO-R', where R' is ethyl.

Wait, substituent A is O-CO-CH2CH3, meaning it's a methyl ester of a compound. Wait, no, R is attached to the benzene, so substituent A is R-O-CO-R', where R is H (attached to benzene) and R' is ethyl? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is CH2CH3-O-CO- attached to the ring. So substituent A is ethyl ester: CH2CH3-O-CO- attached to benzene.

In that case, substituent A would have 3 carbons (COO) and 2 carbons from ethyl, so total 5 C. Substituent B: CH3 (1 C). Benzene:6.

Total C:6+5+1=12. So formula would be C12H?O2.

Now, H count.

Benzene:6-2=4.

Substituent A: ethyl ester group: CH2CH3-O-CO-.

The ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 5 H (2 on CH2, 3 on CH3). The COO group has no H.

Substituent B: CH3 has 3 H.

Total H:4 +5 +3=12.

So formula is C12H12O2. Which is option C.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. So where are the vinyl protons in this structure? The substituent A is an ethyl ester, which doesn't have any vinyl groups.

Ah, that's a problem. The NMR shows two signals for vinyl protons, so substituent must have a vinyl group.

So perhaps substituent A is a vinyl ester. Like, substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-R.

If substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3, then substituent A has 5 C.

Substituent B is CH3.

Total C:6+5+1=12.

H count: Benzene (4) + substituent A (vinyl group: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 has 3 CH2 H and 3 CH3 H?), substituent B (3 H).

Wait, substituent A: CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

CH2=CH has 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH. But the CH is connected to O, so it's CH2=CH-O-.

So substituent A contributes 3 H from the vinyl group and 3 H from the CH3 in the ester.

Substituent B: CH3 (3 H).

Total H:4 (benzene) +3 (vinyl CH2) +3 (ester CH3) +3 (substituent B CH3) =13 H.

But the formula would then be C12H13O2, which isn't an option.

Hmm. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3 (vinyl ester) and substituent B is another CH3.

So substituent A:5 C (CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3: 2 C in CH2=CH, 1 O, 2 C in COO, and 1 C in CH3).

Substituent B:1 C (CH3).

Total C:6+5+1=12.

H count:

Benzene:4.

Substituent A:

CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH has 1 H (but it's connected to O, so maybe it's deshielded or split differently).

Ester CH3 has 3 H.

So substituent A contributes 2+1 +3=6 H.

Substituent B:3 H.

Total H:4+6+3=13. Again, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent has a different structure. Maybe substituent A is a methoxy group and substituent B is a vinyl group. But then the ester would have to be in another substituent.

Wait, but the IR shows ester, so the substituent must have an ester group.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a group with both ester and vinyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2- something, but that brings in CH2 groups which are not in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

In that case, substituent A has 5 C (COO, CH2, CH=CH2).

Substituent B: CH3.

Total C:6+5+1=12.

H count:

Benzene:4.

Substituent A: CH2 has 2 H, CH=CH2 has 2 H on CH2 and 2 H on CH (but wait, CH=CH2 has one CH and one CH2.

Wait, substituent A: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The CH2 has 2 H, the CH=CH2 has 1 H on CH (since it's double bonded to CH2), and the CH2 at the end has 2 H.

Wait, structure: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So substituent A's structure is:

O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the CH2 groups are:

1. The CH2 next to COO: 2 H.

2. The CH=CH2 group: the first CH has 1 H (since double bonded), and the CH2 has 2 H.

So substituent A contributes 2 + (1 +2) =5 H.

The CH2-CH=CH2 part has 2 (from first CH2) + 1 (from CH) + 2 (from CH2)=5 H.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Substituent A: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

The protons on the CH2 group adjacent to COO would be a quartet or something due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH2 group.

The CH=CH2 group would have the CH protons coupling with adjacent groups.

But the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H: one doublet, one doublet of quartets.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O- something, but again, that brings in CH2 groups.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.

The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degrees of unsaturation can help. For a benzene ring (which has 3 double bonds or equivalent), each substituent may contribute additional degrees of unsaturation.

For example, an ester group (COO) has one double bond, so it adds one degree.

So benzene (3 DOU) + ester (1 DOU) =4.

Additionally, substituent B: if it's a methyl group, no DOU.

If substituent A is a vinyl group, that adds another DOU.

Wait, but in the case where substituent A is a vinyl group, that would add another DOU, making total 5.

Wait, but each ring or double bond counts as one DOU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) + vinyl (1) =5.

Now, the formula for the compound is CxHyOz.

For the options, let's compute degrees of unsaturation.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N.

For option C: C12H12O2.

C=12, H=12, O=2.

So DOU = (2*12 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (26-12)/2 =14/2=7.

Which breaks down to: benzene (3) + ester (1) + substituent (maybe another ring or double bond).

Wait, but the substituent might be a vinyl group (another double bond), making total 5 from benzene, ester, and vinyl. Then, where do the other two come from?

Hmm, perhaps the ester comes from a group that adds another double bond. Or perhaps the substituent is a ring.

Alternatively, maybe substituent A is a cyclic ester or something, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent A is a benzyl group, contributing another ring.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the information.

The NMR shows two CH3 signals. So there are two different methyl groups.

In the ester group, the R' could be a methyl group (O-CO-CH3), contributing one CH3 signal. The other CH3 could be another substituent, like a methyl group attached to the ring.

So substituent A: O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), substituent B: CH3.

In that case, the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: O-CO-CH3 and CH3.

Assuming they are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets (two signals), which matches the NMR.

The CH3 groups: O-CO-CH3 and the ring-attached CH3. These would be two different environments, so two signals.

The vinyl H: where are they? Because the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H. So perhaps one of the substituents is a vinyl group.

Ah, substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), but that brings in CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent A is O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2. So substituent A is a vinyl ester.

In that case, substituent A would have a vinyl group.

So substituent A: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

Substituent B: CH3.

So the structure is benzene with substituents O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 and CH3.

Now, let's compute the formula.

Benzene:6 C.

Substituent A: O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2 has 5 C (COO:2, CH2:1, CH=CH2:2).

Substituent B: CH3 has 1 C.

Total C:6+5+1=12.

Hydrogens:

Benzene:6-2=4.

Substituent A:

O-CO-CH2-CH=CH2.

CH2 has 2 H.

CH=CH2 has 1 H on CH (since double bonded) and 2 H on CH2.

So substituent A contributes 2 +1 +2 =5 H.

Substituent B: CH3 has 3 H.

Total H:4 +5 +3=12.

So formula is C12H12O2. Which is option C.

But wait, in this structure, the substituent A has a vinyl group, which would result in the two vinyl H signals in the NMR.

The vinyl protons in CH=CH2 would have certain splitting patterns.

The CH proton (from CH=CH2) would be adjacent to the CH2 group, leading to coupling. So perhaps the CH proton is a doublet of quartets, and the CH2 protons are each a quartet.

Alternatively, the substituent's vinyl group would have protons that split into the observed signals.

Additionally, the two CH3 groups (from the ester and the substituent) would give two signals.

So this seems to fit.

So the molecular formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals indicate that the aromatic ring has two distinct environments for the protons, likely due to the substituents being in non-symmetrical positions (e.g., meta or ortho).
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggest the presence of a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
3. **Methyl groups**: Two signals indicate the presence of two distinct methyl groups.
4. **No CH2 signals**: This implies that the compound does not contain any CH2 groups.

### Analysis of the Options:
The molecular formula options are:
- **A) C11H14O2**

- Substituent B is likely a methyl group (**CH3**) attached directly to the benzene ring, contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- The vinyl group is part of one of the substituents, which could be a vinyl ester group like **CH2=CH-O-CO-CH3**. This group contributes 5 carbons and 6 hydrogens.

#### Molecular Formula:
- Benzene ring: 6 carbons.
- Substituent A (ester): 5 carbons and 6 hydrogens.
- Substituent B (methyl): 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
