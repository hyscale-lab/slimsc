Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. So, H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? Which means each component is a Pauli matrix. And n is a unit vector, so it has components, say, (n_x, n_y, n_z), each squared adding up to 1.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. They look like these 2x2 matrices. But when dealing with the dot product, I think σ · n would be a linear combination of these matrices. Like, σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H would also be a 2x2 matrix, since each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and n is a unit vector, so the coefficients are just scalars.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix? Oh, right. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you multiply them by a scalar and add them together, how does that affect the eigenvalues? Well, since H is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix (because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and ε is real), its eigenvalues should be real.

But more specifically, I think the eigenvalues of σ · n are the same as the eigenvalues of each individual Pauli matrix but scaled by the direction vector n. Wait no, that's not right. Because the dot product is a sum of the scaled Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, because each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1, and n is a unit vector, so the direction doesn't change the magnitude of the eigenvalues. Wait, no, that's not quite correct. Because when you take σ · n, the eigenvalues are actually ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the vector. But wait, the vector here is n, which is a unit vector. So the magnitude is 1. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1? Or do I have to consider the scaling factor ε?

Wait, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n. So the eigenvalues will be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. So what are the eigenvalues of σ · n
