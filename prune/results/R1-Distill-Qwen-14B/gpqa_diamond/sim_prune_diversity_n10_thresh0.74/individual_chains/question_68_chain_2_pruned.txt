Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. So mu is in the same direction as the field, right?

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when a particle's spin is subject to a magnetic field, its energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect. The magnetic moment aligns with the field because that's the lowest energy state.

So initially, when the field is along Z, the spin is up in the Z direction. The energy levels are E = -gamma * mu_B * B * m_s, where m_s is ±1/2. Wait, but mu is given as gamma*Sz. Oh, right, because the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin component, so mu = gamma * Sz. So the energy is E = -mu·B, which for B along Z is E = -gamma * B * <Sz>, since Sz is the spin component in Z-direction.

But then the magnetic field is switched off and on along Y. So the field is now in the Y direction. Wait, no, the initial field is along Z, then it's turned off, and another field along Y is turned on. So the magnetic field is now along Y, same magnitude B.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So the expectation value of Sz, denoted as <Sz>, starts oscillating. I need to find the frequency of these oscillations.

I remember that when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the spin precesses around the new field direction. So the expectation values of the spin components will oscillate over time due to this precession. The frequency of this precession is related to the Larmor frequency, I think.

Wait, what's the Larmor frequency again? Oh right, for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is called the Larmor frequency. The formula I recall is omega = gamma * B, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait,
