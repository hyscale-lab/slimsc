Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of carbon atoms in product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Trans-cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group (CH₂=CH–CHO), but wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. Let me think: the structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So it's benzene with a CH₂CH₂CHO group? No, wait. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group but in a trans configuration. Oh wait, no, the structure is actually benzaldehyde with a CH₂CH₂ group attached? Wait, no, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. So the structure is: benzene ring connected to a CH₂–CH₂–CHO group, but that's not right because that would be a single bond. Oh wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is benzene connected to a propenal group with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2.

So, structure-wise, it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, that can't be right because propenal is CH₂
