Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which of the options has the highest density. There are four options (a to d) and the choices are labeled A to D. 

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each option, I need to figure out the mass and the radius (since volume depends on radius), and then compute the density.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth's mass is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg, and the radius is roughly 6.37 x 10^6 meters. The density of Earth is about 5.5 g/cm³, which is 5500 kg/m³. So option a has a density of 5500 kg/m³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's the same density as Earth. Because the question says the density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so regardless of the mass, the density is the same as Earth. So option b's density is the same as Earth, so 5500 kg/m³.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means the same density, right? Because if the composition is the same, like if it's made of similar materials, the density would be the same. So the mass is 5 Earth masses, but since density is mass/volume, and mass increases while volume (radius cubed) increases as well. Wait, but the question says the same composition, so the density should be same as Earth. So option c's density is same as Earth, 5500 kg/m³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. So density is 5500 kg/m³.

Wait, so all options have the same density as Earth except option b? No, wait option b says the planet has a density of 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth. Oh wait, but wait, b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's same as Earth's density.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Option c: same composition as Earth, so same density, but 5 times more massive. So Earth's mass is M, this planet is 5M. But since density is same, volume is (5M)/density. But Earth's volume is M/(density), so this planet's radius would be cube root of (5M/(density) * [Earth's volume factor]). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of scaling.

If a planet has same composition as Earth, then their density is same. So regardless of the mass, the density remains the same. So option c's density is same as Earth, same as a, b, d.

Wait, but wait, option b says the planet has a density of 5.5. So same as Earth. So all the options a, b, c, d have same density as Earth except maybe none. But that can't be, because the question is asking which has the highest density. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read the options again.

Option a: Earth mass and Earth radius. So same as Earth, density 5500 kg/m³.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5 g/cm³. So same density as Earth, right? Because 5.5 is Earth's density. So this planet's mass is 2 Earth masses but same density. So that would imply a larger volume, but same density. So its radius would be larger than Earth's.

Option c: same composition as Earth, which leads to same density, but 5 times Earth's mass. So same density. So larger radius.

Option d: same composition, so same density, but half the mass. So smaller radius.

So all options except option b are about same density? Wait, no, option b's
