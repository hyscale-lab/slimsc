Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, I'm picturing like an ellipsoid or a prolate spheroid, maybe? Anyway, the main thing is the symmetryâ€”so it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it should radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength is given as lambda.

They're asking about the power radiated per unit solid angle. So, I remember that when you talk about radiation in electromagnetism, especially from oscillating charges, you use the concept of power per unit solid angle, which is like the intensity in a particular direction.

In the radiation zone, which is far away from the source, the fields behave like electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the source's symmetry. Since this is a spheroid with z-axis symmetry, I think the radiation might have a certain angular dependence. 

The problem states that the maximum power is A, and they want the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, along with a possible form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Wait, I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is such that the power radiated is proportional to (sin theta)^2, where theta is the angle from the dipole's axis. But wait, this is an oscillating charge distribution, which could be considered as a dipole if it's oscillating, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadrupole or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think for a spheroidal distribution, the radiation might have a more specific angular dependence. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think again. In the case of a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis, meaning theta=90 degrees. The pattern is sin^2(theta), so maximum at 90. But in this case, the maximum is at some other angle? Or perhaps it's symmetric in a different way.

Wait, no, wait. The question says the charge distribution is spheroid, so perhaps it's an oscillating dipole or something else. But whatever the case, the function f would depend on theta and lambda.

The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity
