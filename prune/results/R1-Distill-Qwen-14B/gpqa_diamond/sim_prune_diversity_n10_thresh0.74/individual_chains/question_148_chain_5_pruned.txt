Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are involved in various reactions, and I need to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me break down the information given:

1. **A1**: A bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Hmm, what are some bright red fluorine compounds? I'm thinking of compounds like F2, but that's not a binary compound with Y. Oh wait, maybe something like ClF3 or BrF3? Wait, no, those aren't red. Alternatively, maybe some metal fluoride with F?

Wait, another thought: I remember that when concentrated HNO3 reacts with KCl, Cl2 is released, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, what about fluorine's compounds with oxygen? No, because Y is another element.

Wait, let me think again. The decomposition of A1 produces F2 and A2. So the reaction should be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Let's say A1 is YF_x, and upon decomposition, it gives A2 (which is perhaps YF_y) and F2. Because A1 is a binary compound, Y and F only.

Wait, but when a compound decomposes into another compound and F2, maybe it's a fluorination reaction. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me move on and see if other clues can help.

2. **A3**: Can interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So fluorinating Y gives A3. So A3 is YF_z.

Then, **A4**: When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

Wait, adding Y to a solution of A4 to make A5. Let me think about reactions where adding a metal to a solution of a salt produces something else.

If the solution is colorless and
