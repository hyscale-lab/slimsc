Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Alright, the problem involves a spin 1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember that spin 1/2 particles are like electrons or something similar, right? They have spin quantum numbers of ±1/2.

The problem says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So mu = γ S_z. And they align this magnetic moment with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. So initially, the field is along Z.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the initial situation is a magnetic field along Z, then it's switched to a field along Y. And the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. I think this has to do with the time evolution of the spin state when the magnetic field changes direction.

Let me recall some quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by H = -μ·B. Oh wait, sometimes it's written as H = -γ S·B, depending on how you define the magnetic moment. Let me get this right. The magnetic moment μ is related to the spin S by μ = γ S. So the Hamiltonian should be H = -μ·B = -γ S·B.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated that μ = γ S_z. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says μ is equal to gamma times Sz. So μ = γ S_z. So that implies that the magnetic moment is along the z-direction only. But wait, that might be only when the field is along z. Or is that the general case?

Wait, the problem says the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, maybe that's the expression for mu when the magnetic field is along z. Or perhaps the magnetic moment is always gamma times the spin in some direction, but here in this case, the spin is in the z-direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The magnetic moment is related to spin by μ = γ S, but perhaps here they're simplifying it for the specific case when the field is along z. Hmm,
