Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through each step carefully. The question involves several reactions, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I need to visualize that structure. So, cyclohexanone means a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Propene has three carbons. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, no. Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)- attached via the second carbon. Oh wait, no, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no. Wait, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually CH2-C(=CH2)- attached. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, that's not right. Oh, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-, but the substituent is attached at the middle carbon. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, the substituent is at the second carbon, so the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So, like: CH2-CH2-CH
