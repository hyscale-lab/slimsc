Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So the problem is about a mixture of salts A and B. They're equimolar, and the total mass is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, the resulting gases are passed through some tubes. 

The setup of the tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, then red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Okay, so when salts decompose upon heating, they can produce various gases. The setup seems like a gas analysis problem.

So, the first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, anhydrous. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent, I think. When it's used in a tube, it probably absorbs water vapor from the gas mixture. So if the weight of tube 1 increases by 3.60g, that suggests that 3.60g of water was absorbed. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water.

The reaction for that would be Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O. So each mole of water would add 18g/mol to the tube. Wait, but the mass gained is 3.60g. So moles of H2O would be 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 moles.

So we have 0.2 moles of H2O produced.

Then, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change. That suggests that no gas was absorbed. What gases would react with Ca(OH)2 solution? Well, CO2 would react with it, producing CaCO3 and water. So if there was CO2, the solution would become more basic or neutral, but if the tube's weight didn't change, maybe no CO2 was present? Or perhaps it was all reacted, but the setup is that the tube is a solution, so any CO2 would be absorbed. Alternatively, maybe the gas passed through didn't have CO2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's another possibility. If the gas after the first tube doesn't contain any CO2, then the second tube wouldn't gain any weight. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else. But I'll come back to this.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. What gas reacts with red-hot copper? I think CO would react. The reaction is 2Cu + CO → 2CuO + C (carbon). Or wait, maybe it's CO reacting with Cu to form CuO and some carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's H2 reacting? Let me think.

Wait, no, when CO reacts with Cu, it produces CuO. The reaction is:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (solid carbon).

So the mass gained in the copper tube would be the mass of CuO formed. Each mole of CO would produce one mole of CuO. The molar mass of CuO is 80g/mol, but let's see the 0.80g gain.

Wait, but wait. The mass increase in the copper tube is due to the reaction of CO, because CuO is formed. So how much CO was there?

Wait, the mass of CuO formed would be 0.80g. Let's calculate moles: 0.80g / 80g/mol = 0.
