Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy when a charge is near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves in certain ways. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can work through the concepts and see which one fits.

First, I remember that a grounded conductor allows charges to flow in or out through the Earth. So if I have a charge near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the charges will lie on the surface.

Wait, the charge q is placed outside the sphere, right? Because d is the distance from the center, so if d is larger than R, then the charge is outside. But I don't know if d is bigger or smaller than R. The question doesn't specify, so I have to consider both possibilities? Or maybe it's just given as a setup regardless.

But wait, the problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere. So when a charge is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since it's grounded, electrons can move in or out of the sphere.

If the charge q is positive, the sphere will have a negative charge induced near it, with the opposite charge on the far side. Or if q is negative, the sphere would have positive charges near it. But regardless, the net charge on the sphere would be zero if it's grounded, right? No, wait, that's not correct. The sphere is a conductor, and if it's grounded, any induced charges would allow the sphere to have a charge. Hmm, wait no, if you have a neutral sphere and you bring a charge near it, the induced charges redistribute but the sphere's net charge remains zero because it's neutral. But wait, if the sphere was initially charged, then it would stay charged. But in this problem, I think the sphere is just a grounded conducting sphere, so perhaps it's neutral to begin with.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When you have a conducting sphere and you bring a charge close to it, the charges in the conductor redistribute. For a grounded sphere, the redistribution is such that the potential on the surface is the same everywhere, which is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero. Wait, no. Wait, the ground is at a potential of
