Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The scenario is that I created a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. I introduced a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the protein. I used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells, selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't overexpressing. When I looked at the construct's plus strand sequence, I noticed something's wrong.

Looking at the provided sequence, I need to see if there's an issue in the coding region that would prevent proper expression. Let me think about possible problems.

The options given are A, B, C, D. Let's go through them.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. The construct includes the HA sequence, and if there was a mutation in it, maybe the protein wouldn't form correctly. But I'm not sure if that would prevent expression entirely or just affect the HA epitope. Also, the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed, not that the epitope is missing.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon somewhere. Let's look for a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence.

Looking through the sequence, let's scan for these triplets. Let's break the sequence into codons. The sequence starts with ATG (which is methionine, start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartate), GCT (alanine), TCC (serine), etc. Wait, looking for any TAA, TAG, TGA.

Hmm, I should scan the entire sequence. Let me go through codon by codon.

The sequence is long, but let me see. Let's find the stop codon in the sequence.

Looking for TGA or TAA or TAG. Let me go through the sequence:

Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA ...

Wait, I see TTA here. That's Tryptophan. Then CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA. Then GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGC GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTA ...

Wait, I see a TTA again. Then later on: ...GTG GAG GAC GAG GGCGACATC GCG CTG CAG ATC C...

Wait, I'm not seeing a TGA or TAA or TAG. Let me check the end.

Wait, the end of the sequence is ...GTT TTA CGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGC GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTA CGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGC GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTA CGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGC GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTA.

Wait, actually, I'm seeing multiple TTA codons, which are tryptophan. But I don't see any TGA, TAA, or TAG. So if there's no stop codon in the plus strand, that's strange. Because without a stop codon, the ribosome would read through, but in reality, the mRNA has to have a stop codon to terminate. So perhaps the construct's coding sequence doesn't include a stop codon, causing the ribosome to read through into the plasmid's other regions, perhaps leading to early termination elsewhere, or maybe the vector's own stop codon is causing problems.

Wait, but in the construct, the plus strand is the coding strand. The actual mRNA would be complementary. So the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand's coding sequence. So if the coding sequence ends with a stop codon, then the mRNA would have that.

Wait, looking at the end of the given sequence: ...TGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

At the very end, I see 'GAGTGA'. Let's break that into codons: GAG is glutamic acid, TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait! So the last part is ...GAG TGA. So the stop codon is TGA. So the construct does have a stop codon, at the end.

Wait, so the construct does have a stop codon. So the ribosome wouldn't terminate early unless there's an in-frame stop codon before that. Let me scan the entire sequence again for any in-frame TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking through the sequence:
