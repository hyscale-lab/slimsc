Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W, precipitate G, and eventually B. Then there's a mention of a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. And the goal is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's break this down. First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X is composed of elements that have at least one heavier isotope. Maybe like Cl has isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37? Wait, chlorine has a couple of isotopes, but perhaps X is something like Cl2, but maybe it's another element.

The reaction between X and Y is violent, releasing gas W. W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hmmm, maybe H2O? No, because H has 1 proton, O has 8, so H2O has 2 H and 1 O. The molecule would have 2*(1) + 8 = 10 protons, and each H has 1 neutron? No, no, wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons. Wait, each molecule's protons (sum all protons) and neutrons (sum all neutrons) are equal. So for example, H2O would have 2 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutron) and 1 O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 2+8=10, total neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility. NH3? No, let's see: N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So molecule has 7+3=10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7, so 7 neutrons. Each H has 0. So total neutrons =7. Wait, that's 10 protons and 7 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, what about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4*1=10. Neutrons: C has 6, each H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, perhaps something like O2? O has 8 protons each. So O2 has 16 protons. Neutrons: each O has 8, so O2 has 16. Oh, that works. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So molecule of O2 would have same number of protons and neutrons. But would O2 be a gas produced in such a reaction? Maybe, but let me think about what the reaction could be.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think about the context of the reaction. X and Y react violently. If X is a halogen, like Cl2, and Y is water? No, Cl2 reacts with water but not violently. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is a base, like NaOH, and X is something else
