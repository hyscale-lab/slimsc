Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find the maximum period it can have while still showing both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, so transits happen when a planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, leading to a slight decrease in the observed brightness as well. For both events to happen, the two planets must be in a configuration where their orbital periods are such that their orbital paths around the star allow them to periodically align as seen from Earth. I think this is related to orbital resonance or something about their orbital periods' ratio.

Wait, but I'm not quite sure. Let me think again. For both transit and occultation to occur, the planets must transit each other's positions in the system as seen from Earth. So, for this, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are in harmony, perhaps. So the key is finding the orbital period of the second planet relative to the first.

I remember that for two objects orbiting the same star, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital periods are in a ratio that allows them to periodically align. So like, the ratio of their periods must be a ratio of small integers, like 2:1, 3:2, etc. But wait, the problem is asking for the maximum period of the second planet. So perhaps the second planet's period is longer than the first, but not too much so that the alignment events don't happen.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the concept here is about the Hill sphere or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the synodic period, which is the period between similar events as seen from Earth.

Wait, another approach. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, their orbital periods determine how often they align in the sky. For a transit and occultation to occur, the second planet must sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). So their orbital periods must allow that.

Alternatively, thinking about the planet-star system. The first planet's period is 3 days. The second has a longer period, let's say P. For both transits and occultations to happen, the two planets must be able to pass in front of each other relative to the star. So the maximum period for the second planet is when the two are in a 1:1 orbital resonance? No, wait, because if their periods are the same, they would always be in the same position, so either both transit or not. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe the condition is that the second planet's orbital period must be longer than the first, but in such a way that the alignment occurs. So perhaps the maximum period occurs when their orbital periods are in a 1:1 ratio, but I think that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, the maximum period would be when
