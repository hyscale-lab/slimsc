Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the angular momentum states of two electrons in p orbitals. I remember that in such problems, the total angular momentum is the combination of individual angular momenta.

So, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so l1 is 1 and l2 is also 1. That makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, right? Because when you couple two l=1's, the possible total l's are 0, 1, 2. So 2 is the maximum here. And m is -1.

The question is about measuring L1z and L2z for both electrons and finding the probability that both have eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each L_z for an electron in a p orbital (l=1) can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. Because the eigenvalues are mħ, and m can be -1, 0, +1. So, for each electron, L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m (the sum of m1 and m2) is -1. Because m is the total z-component of angular momentum. So m = m1 + m2. 

Wait, for the state |1,
