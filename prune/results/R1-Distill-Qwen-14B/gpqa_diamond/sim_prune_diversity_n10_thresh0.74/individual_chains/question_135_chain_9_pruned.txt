Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ_f fψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Not entirely sure about the notation, but I think it's a Yukawa-type interaction. In Yukawa theory, the interaction term is between a scalar field (like the Higgs) and fermions, something like λ ψ φ ψ. So here, X is the boson field, and it's interacting with fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into, considering their masses.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy of X must be enough to produce the particles. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion it's decaying into. Because each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum energy required is when they are at rest, so each must have mass less than or equal to half of X's mass.

X has a mass of 6 GeV, so each fermion pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with a mass below or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV?

I need to remember the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV (Wait, that's about 4.5 GeV. So 4.5 is more than 3 GeV. So b quarks are too heavy for X to decay into b bbar, because 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV, which is much higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So b quarks cannot be produced. So any option containing b bbar is incorrect. Wait the options have option A and D with b bbar. So those can't be right.

Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV. So t quark is out of the question.

Leptons: electron (e): ~0.5 MeV, muon
