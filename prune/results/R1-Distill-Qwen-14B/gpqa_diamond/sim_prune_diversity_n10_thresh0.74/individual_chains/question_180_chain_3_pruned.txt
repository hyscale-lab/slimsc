Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charges. The setup is a bit specific, so I need to parse it carefully.

Alright, the problem says: There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so maybe they're treated as point charges without worrying about kinetic energy much, but I'm not sure yet.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm trying to visualize this. Point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. The other 12 are each positioned on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P, I think. Since they're constrained to stay at 2 m, they form a sort of spherical shell around P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of this system. Hmm. I'm remembering that the potential energy of a system of point charges is calculated considering the potential each charge contributes to the others. But wait, the problem says "minimum energy." So, is it the potential energy or the total mechanical energy? I think for a system of charges, the minimum energy would correspond to the potential energy when they are arranged in a configuration with the least possible potential energy, which for identical charges would likely be the most stable configuration. But in this case, some are fixed at a distance.

Wait, the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So their positions are fixed, right? So the system's potential energy is fixed as well. So perhaps the problem is just about calculating the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, but point P is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is fixed there, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So what's the potential energy here?

I think I need to calculate the potential energy of the entire system. But wait, potential energy in an electrostatic system is the work done to assemble the charges, bringing them from infinity to their positions. So the formula for potential energy between two point charges is
