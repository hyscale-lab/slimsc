Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about treating (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard and chiral. I need to figure out what the chromatograms will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes forms an epoxide. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide.

Wait, but the starting materials are (E) and (Z) isomers of oct-4-ene. So each will react differently. Let me think about the structures.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, octane has 8 carbons. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5.

The (E) isomer has the higher priority groups on opposite sides. Let's say for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are probably ethyl groups or something. Hmm, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the groups on either end of the double bond are opposite. The (Z) would have them on the same side.

But wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening, but wait, no. mCPBA adds an epoxide across the double bond in a
