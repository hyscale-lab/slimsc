Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results which aren't physical. So the question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization at high energies. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from the usual quantum field theories because it's a theory of strings vibrating rather than point particles. Strings have length scales, so maybe they don't have the same kinds of divergences that require regularization. Or wait, do they? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences as QFTs. So maybe they don't require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I know that QCD does require renormalization, which involves dealing with divergences. So regularization must be used here. For example, when calculating loop diagrams, you get divergences that need to be handled. So B might require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's the first quantum field theory and it definitely requires renormalization. So regularization is a part of QED calculations. So C needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. In classical theories, like Maxwell's equations, you don't have the same divergences as in the quantum case. So you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with the same infinities that come from quantum loop effects. So in classical ED, you don't need any regularization techniques because the theory is already finite in that context.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So the options are about whether each theory, when applied at high energies, needs regularization.

Wait, but if the theory is classical, like option D, then at high energies (like in the ultraviolet limit), does it have issues? Or does it not require regularization because it's already a classical theory without the divergences of the quantum version?

Wait, but the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So if the theory is classical, then regularization isn't needed because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So option D
