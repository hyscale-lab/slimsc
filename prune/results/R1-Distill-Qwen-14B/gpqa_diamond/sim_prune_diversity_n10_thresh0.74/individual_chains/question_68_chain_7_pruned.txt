Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field changes direction. Let me start by recalling what I know about spin systems and magnetic moments.

The particle is spin 1/2, which means its spin can be either up or down, right? The magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma * Sz. Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the moment is aligned with it.

When the magnetic field is turned off, the particle is no longer in a magnetic field, so I think the energy levels might not depend on the magnetic field anymore. But then another magnetic field is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B as before. So the system now has a magnetic field in the y-direction.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. Hmm. I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and hence the time evolution of the state.

Initially, the Hamiltonian must have been H_initial = -mu·B, which in terms of spin is proportional to Sz. But after the field changes to the Y-direction, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu·B', where B' is in Y. So H_final would involve S_y instead of S_z.

So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Since the particle is spin-1/2, the possible eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. But wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz, so the Hamiltonian in terms of spin operators would be something like H = -gamma * B * S_y. Or wait, let me get that right. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma * Sz, so the energy is U = -mu · B. So when B is in the y-direction, U = -gamma * B * S_y.

So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y. But spin states are eigenstates of S_z, right? So the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z, but the new Hamiltonian is in terms of S_y. So the state will evolve under this new Hamiltonian.

Wait, but the system is now in a state that's a superposition of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment
