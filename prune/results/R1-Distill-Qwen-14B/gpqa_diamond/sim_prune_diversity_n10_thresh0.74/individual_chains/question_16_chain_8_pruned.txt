Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when the molecule has chirality, which requires at least one stereocenter and the molecule isn't symmetrical in a way that would make the stereocenters cancel each other out.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, no, butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Or wait, no, 1-chloro is on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but the numbering: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl connected where? So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2X, but 1-chloro is on the first carbon. Wait, so it
