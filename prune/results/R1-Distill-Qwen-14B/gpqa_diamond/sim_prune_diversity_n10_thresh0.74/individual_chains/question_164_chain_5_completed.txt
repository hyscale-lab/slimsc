Okay, so I'm trying to answer this astronomy question about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And when they eclipse each other, we can observe eclipses. The periods given are the time between consecutive primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of each system.

The question is asking about the mass of each system. It says to consider the mass as the sum of the two stars. So, I need to find the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2.

From what I remember, in binary star systems, the radial velocity (RV) method is used to determine the masses. The RV method measures the Doppler shifts in the stars' spectra as they move towards and away from us. Each star's velocity is sinusoidal, and the amplitude is related to their mass.

The formula I think is something like M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1), where K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars. Wait, let me get that right. Oh, right, because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's closer to the center of mass. So if one star has a larger velocity amplitude, the other must be less massive.

Wait wait, the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. The formula is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = ( (K1 P )/(2πG) ) where P is the orbital period, and K1 is the semi-amplitude. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, another approach: the ratio of the masses can be determined by the inverse ratio of their velocities. Because in a binary system, the center of mass is the balance point. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Ah, that's right. Because the more massive star has a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

So for each system, I can compute the mass ratio and then compare the total masses.

Wait, but wait. Let's think step by step.

System_1: RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. Let's call the velocities K1 and K2. So K1 =10, K2=5. So M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2.

Wait, but the total mass would be M1 + M2. So for system_1, total mass is 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, in the binary system, M1 is the mass of the first star and M2 the other. Then, the ratio M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). So if K1 is 10, K2 is 5, then M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So M1 = (1/2) M2.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

But wait, what about system_2? Let's calculate the same.

System_2: RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. Let's say K3=15 and K4=10. So M3/M4 = K4/K3. So M3 = (10/15) M4 = (2/3) M4.

So the total mass of system_2 is M3 + M4 = (2/3 M4) + M4 = (5/3) M4.

Wait, but how do I relate these two systems to find the total mass ratio?

Hmm, right. Because the periods are different, but I think the period doesn't directly affect the mass ratio. Because the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses regardless of the period. Because in a binary system, the period is determined by the masses and the separation, but the velocity amplitudes relate directly to the mass ratio.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the formula again.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (2π G) / (P c^2) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(1/3) ) ), but that's complicated. Alternatively, for a binary system, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1. So if the velocities are K1 and K2, the masses are in the inverse proportion.

So for system_1:

K1 =10, K2=5. So M1/M2 =5/10=0.5. So M1=0.5 M2. Total mass of system_1: 1.5 M2.

For system_2:

K3=15, K4=10. So M3/M4 =10/15=2/3. So M3=(2/3) M4. Total mass of system_2: (2/3 + 1) M4 = (5/3) M4.

Now, we need to compare the total masses of system_1 and system_2.

But wait, system_1's total mass is 1.5 M2, system_2's is 5/3 M4. How do M2 and M4 relate?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here because the variables are M2 and M4. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps I should express both systems in terms of a common variable. Let me denote for system_1: M1 and M2 are the two stars. For system_2: M3 and M4 are the two stars.

Wait, no, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass of each system in terms of their individual components.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the mass function for each system and then relate them.

Wait, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), and it can be derived from the radial velocity. But without knowing the inclination angle i (which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight), we can't get the exact masses. However, the question might assume that the inclination is the same for both systems, or that it's not required because the ratio would cancel out.

Wait, but since the periods are given, perhaps we can relate the masses using the Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of binary stars is given by (M1 + M2) P² = (4π²/G) a³, where a is the separation between the stars. But without knowing 'a' (the semi-major axis), it's tricky. Alternatively, combining radial velocities with the period could help.

Alternatively, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) ) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(1/3) )

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps for each system, the ratio of the velocities is K1/K2 = (M2 sin i)/(M1 sin i) ) ) because the inclination i is the same for both stars. So the ratio K1/K2 = M2/M1.

But wait, earlier I thought that M1/M2 = K2/K1. So if K1 is star 1's velocity, then M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1: K1=10, K2=5. So M1/M2 = 5/10=0.5. So M1 is half M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2: K3=15, K4=10. So M3/M4=10/15=2/3. So M3 is (2/3) M4. Total mass = (2/3 +1 ) M4 = (5/3) M4.

Now, to find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 and system_2: (1.5 M2) / ( (5/3) M4 ) = ( (3/2) M2 ) / ( (5/3) M4 ) ) = (3/2 * 3/5 ) (M2 / M4 ) = (9/10) (M2 / M4 ).

Wait, but how do we relate M2 and M4? Hmm, I'm not sure. Because the periods are different, but I don't know if that affects the relation between M2 and M4.

Wait, another thought: the orbital period P is related to the masses and the separation. But without knowing the separation, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio is independent of the period.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate the P to the masses. Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a³ (M1 + M2) )

But without knowing a, we can't directly get M from P. But maybe for each system, the P is given.

Wait, system_1 has P=2 years, system_2 has P=1 year.

So system_1: P1 = 2 years, system_2: P2=1 year.

So for system_1, the mass function f(M1) could be expressed in terms of K1, P, and sin i. Similarly for system_2.

But since we don't know sin i, which is the inclination, and the same for both systems, but it's possible that sin i is the same or different. But the question says to consider the mass as the sum, so perhaps it's assuming that i is the same? Or maybe it's not necessary because we're looking for a ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the mass functions can give us the ratio of the total masses.

Wait, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (294.3 ) (in solar masses, km/s, years). Because the formula is f(M) = ( (K * sin i )³ P ) / (294.3 ), and f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i ) / ( (M1 + M2)² )

So for system_1, f1 = (10³ P1 sin³i ) / 294.3, and f1 = (M2³ sin³i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )² )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (15³ P2 sin³i ) / 294.3, and f2 = (M4³ sin³i ) / ( (M3 + M4 )² )

But since we don't know sin i, maybe it's not helpful unless we can find a ratio that cancels it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the mass functions f1/f2 and set it equal to the ratio of the expressions involving the masses.

But this might be getting too complicated. Maybe I should think differently. Since the question asks for the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, and each system's mass is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio is independent of the periods. Because the RV amplitudes determine the mass ratio, and the periods could relate to the separation but not the mass ratio.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the mass ratio is just based on the RV amplitudes. That is, for each system, the mass ratio is (M1/M2)= (K2/K1), and the total mass is M1 + M2.

So for system_1: M1 =0.5 M2 (since K2=5, K1=10, so M1=5/10 M2 =0.5 M2). So total mass is 1.5 M2.

For system_2: M3 = (10/15) M4 = (2/3) M4. So total mass is (2/3 +1 ) M4 = (5/3 M4).

Now, the question is, what's the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. So factor = (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2) = (1.5 M2 ) / ( (5/3) M4 ) ) = (1.5 * 3 /5 ) (M2/M4 ) = (4.5/5 ) (M2/M4 )= 0.9 (M2/M4 )

Hmm, so I'm stuck because I don't know the relation between M2 and M4. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law to relate the periods and masses.

For a binary system, the sum of the masses (M1 + M2) is given by:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³)/(G P² )

But I don't know a, the semi-major axis, for either system. Without a, I can't directly compute the masses. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the two systems.

Let me denote for system_1: M1 + M2 = M_total1.

System_2: M3 + M4 = M_total2.

We need to find M_total1 / M_total2.

Using Kepler's law for each system:

M_total1 = (4 π² a1³ )/( G P1² )

M_total2 = (4 π² a2³ )/( G P2² )

So M_total1 / M_total2 = (a1³ / a2³ ) * (P2² / P1² )

But without knowing a1 and a2, I can't compute this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate a1 and a2 using the radial velocities.

Because the radial velocities are related to the velocities of the stars in their orbits. The velocity of each star is given by v = 2 π a sin i / P.

Wait, because the orbital circumference is 2 π a, and the period is P. But only the component along the line of sight matters, which is sin i.

So K = (2 π a sin i ) / (P c )

Wait, actually, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = (2 π G)^(1/3) ( (M2 sin i ) ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, the velocity of each star is proportional to a sin i / P.

Wait, more accurately, the velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (2 π G )^(1/3) ( (M2 sin i ) ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, let's think about the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = (K³ P )/(294.3) = (M2³ sin³ i )/( (M1 + M2 )² )

So for each system, f1 = (10³ * 2 )/294.3 = (1000 *2)/294.3 ≈ 2000 / 294.3 ≈ ~6.79.

Similarly, f2 = (15³ *1 )/294.3 = (3375 *1)/294.3 ≈ ~11.47.

But the mass function is (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2 )² )

But without knowing sin i, perhaps I can relate the two mass functions.

But I'm not sure. Since we don't have information about sin i, perhaps the problem assumes that sin i is the same for both systems. Let's assume that i is the same for both systems, so sin i is the same and can be factored out.

So for system 1:

f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Similarly, for system 2:

f2 = (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M3 + M4 )^2 )

Taking the ratio of f1 to f2:

f1/f2 = [ (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / (M_total1^2) ) ] / [ (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / (M_total2^2) ) ]

Simplify:

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( M_total2^2 / M_total1^2 )

So,

f1/f2 = (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * (M_total2^2 / M_total1^2 )

But we can express M_total1 and M_total2 in terms of their components.

Wait, for system_1, M_total1 = M1 + M2. And M1 = (K2/K1) M2 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So M_total1 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, M_total2 = M3 + M4. And M3 = (K4/K3) M4 = (10/15) M4 ≈ 0.6667 M4. So M_total2 = 1.6667 M4.

So,

f1/f2 = (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( ( (1.6667 M4)^2 ) / ( (1.5 M2 )^2 ) )

Simplify:

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( ( (2.7778 M4² ) ) / ( 2.25 M2² ) )

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( 2.7778 / 2.25 ) * ( M4² / M2² )

= ( M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( 1.2345 ) * ( M4² / M2² )

= 1.2345 * ( M2^(3-2) ) / M4^(3-2) )

= 1.2345 * ( M2 / M4 )

Hmm, but this seems to still have M2 and M4 in the ratio. Which brings me back to the same problem.

Wait, but I have f1 and f2 as numbers. Let me compute f1 and f2:

f1 ≈ 6.79, f2 ≈ 11.47.

So f1/f2 ≈ 6.79 / 11.47 ≈ 0.592.

So,

0.592 = 1.2345 * ( M2 / M4 )

So,

M2 / M4 ≈ 0.592 / 1.2345 ≈ 0.479.

So M2 ≈ 0.479 M4.

Now, M_total1 = 1.5 M2.

M_total2 = (5/3) M4 ≈ 1.6667 M4.

So, M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2) / (1.6667 M4 )

Substituting M2 = 0.479 M4,

= (1.5 * 0.479) / 1.6667

= (0.7185) / 1.6667 ≈ 0.431.

So system_1's mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43. Wait, but the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if it's 0.43 times, that means system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so it's less massive. But the options don't have a 0.43 option as 'more' massive. Wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, wait, I think I might have messed up the ratio. Because M_total1 is 1.5 M2, and earlier M2 =0.479 M4.

So M_total1 = 1.5 * 0.479 M4 = 0.7185 M4.

M_total2 is 1.6667 M4.

So M_total1 / M_total2 = 0.7185 / 1.6667 ≈ 0.43.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, which means system_1 is less massive. But the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Which would be less than 1. The options have A as ~0.4 and D as ~0.7.

But according to my calculation, it's ~0.43, which is close to option A (~0.4).

Wait, but wait. I might have made a mistake in the calculation of f1 and f2.

Wait, let me recompute f1 and f2.

The formula for mass function is f(M) = (K³ P) / (294.3 )

So for system_1:

K1=10, P=2.

f1 = (10^3 * 2 ) / 294.3 = (1000 *2)/294.3 ≈ 2000 / 294.3 ≈ 6.79.

System_2:

K3=15, P=1.

f2 = (15^3 * 1 ) / 294.3 = (3375 *1)/294.3 ≈ 11.47.

So the ratio f1/f2 is ~6.79/11.47≈0.592.

Earlier, I had:

f1/f2 = (M2^3/M4^3) * ( M_total2^2 / M_total1^2 )

But M_total1 =1.5 M2, M_total2 =5/3 M4.

Wait, M_total2 = (M3 + M4)= (2/3 M4 + M4)=5/3 M4.

So,

f1/f2 = (M2^3/M4^3) * ( (5/3 M4)^2 / (1.5 M2 )^2 )

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * ( (25/9 M4² ) / (2.25 M2² ) )

Wait, 1.5 squared is 2.25. So,

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * (25/(9 * 2.25 )) * (M4² / M2² )

25/(9*2.25) = 25/(20.25) ≈1.2345.

So,

= (M2^3 / M4^3 ) * 1.2345 * (M4² / M2² )

= ( M2^(3-2) ) / ( M4^(3-2) ) * 1.2345 )

= ( M2 / M4 ) * 1.2345.

So,

f1/f2 = (M2/M4 ) * 1.2345.

We have f1/f2 ≈0.592.

So,

0.592 = 1.2345 * (M2/M4 )

So,

M2/M4 ≈0.592 /1.2345 ≈0.479.

So M2 ≈0.479 M4.

Now, M_total1 =1.5 M2 =1.5 *0.479 M4 ≈0.7185 M4.

M_total2 =5/3 M4 ≈1.6667 M4.

So the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = 0.7185 /1.6667 ≈0.43.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Which would be less than 1, so the options are A (~0.4), B (~0.6), D (~0.7).

Wait, but 0.43 is closer to option A (0.4) than to option D (0.7).

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating M_total1.

Wait, system_1's total mass is M1 + M2 =0.5 M2 + M2 =1.5 M2.

But M2 is a star in system_1, and M4 is a star in system_2.

But when I calculated M_total1 / M_total2, I had:

M_total1 =1.5 M2.

M_total2=5/3 M4.

But M2 is a star in system_1, and M4 is a star in system_2. So M2 and M4 are different stars in different systems. So perhaps I can't directly relate M2 and M4 without more information.

Wait, but how? Because the systems are independent. So M2 (from system_1) is not the same as M2 (from system_2). I think I messed up by using the same variable M2 for both systems. That's a mistake.

Oh, I see! I used M2 for both systems, which is incorrect. That's where the confusion comes from.

So let's correct that. Let's denote:

For system_1: the two stars are M1 (mass) and M2 (mass).

For system_2: the two stars are M3 and M4.

So when I calculated for system_1, M1 =0.5 M2. So M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2, M3 = (10/15) M4 = 2/3 M4. So M_total2 = 5/3 M4.

Now, when I calculate f1 and f2:

f1 = (10^3 *2 )/294.3 ≈6.79.

f2 = (15^3 *1 )/294.3 ≈11.47.

The mass function for system_1 is f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M3 + M4 )^2 )

So,

f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (1.5 M2 )^2 ) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / (2.25 M2^2 ) ) = ( M2 sin^3 i ) / 2.25.

Similarly,

f2 = (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (5/3 M4 )^2 ) = (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (25/9) M4^2 ) ) = ( M4 sin^3 i ) * (9/25 )

So,

f1 = (M2 sin³ i ) / 2.25.

f2 = (9 M4 sin³ i ) / 25.

Taking the ratio f1/f2 = [ (M2 sin³ i ) / 2.25 ] / [ (9 M4 sin³ i ) /25 ]

Simplify:

= ( M2 / 2.25 ) * (25 ) / (9 M4 )

= (25 M2 ) / ( 2.25 *9 M4 )

= (25 M2 ) / (20.25 M4 )

= (25/20.25) * (M2/M4 )

≈1.2345 * (M2/M4 )

But f1/f2 ≈0.592.

So,

0.592 = 1.2345 * ( M2 /M4 )

So,

M2 / M4 ≈0.592 /1.2345 ≈0.479.

So M2 =0.479 M4.

Now, the total mass of system_1 is M_total1 =1.5 M2 =1.5 *0.479 M4 ≈0.7185 M4.

The total mass of system_2 is M_total2 =5/3 M4 ≈1.6667 M4.

So the mass ratio (M_total1 / M_total2 )= 0.7185 M4 / 1.6667 M4 = 0.7185/1.6667 ≈0.43.

So system_1's total mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive, and the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6, and D is ~0.7. 0.43 is closest to option A (0.4). But wait, the available options don't have exactly 0.43. Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the mass ratio in another way. Maybe the ratio is just the product of (K2/K1) for each system.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Wait, another approach: the more massive star has a lower velocity. So system_1 has two stars with velocities 10 and 5. So the mass ratio is 5:10 =1:2. So system_1's stars have masses in a 1:2 ratio. So the total mass is 3 units. System_2 has velocities 15 and 10. So mass ratio is 10:15 =2:3. So total mass is 5 units.

So system_1's mass is 3 units, system_2's is5 units. So system_1 is 3/5=0.6 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is 0.6. So system_1 is 0.6 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of 0.6.

Wait, that's a different answer. So this approach suggests the ratio is 0.6.

But how is this approach different from the earlier one?

Ah, because in this case, I'm assuming that mass is proportional to the inverse of velocity. So M1/M2 = V2/V1, but not considering the periods.

But earlier, when considering the mass function and the periods, I found a ratio of about 0.43. Now, without considering periods, it's 0.6. So which is correct?

Wait, the issue is that the RV amplitudes depend on both the mass and the period. So to find the mass ratio, you can't just use the velocities because the period also affects the velocities.

Wait, the velocity amplitude K is given by K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) ( (M2 sin i ) )/( ( M1 + M2 )^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Which means that K is proportional to (M2 / (M_total^(2/3) P^(1/3) )).

But since we don't know sin i or the separation, perhaps it's impossible to get the exact masses without more information. But the problem must have a way to find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the mass ratio between the two systems is the cube of the ratio of their velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another approach: the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P)/(294.3) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M_total )^2 )

So for each system, f1 = (10^3 *2 )/294 ≈6.79.

f2 = (15^3 *1 )/294 ≈11.47.

Assuming that the inclination angles are the same (i is same), then sin i is the same. So, for system_1,

f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_total1 )^2 )

For system_2,

f2 = (M4^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

So, f1/f2 = [ M2^3 / M4^3 ] * [ (M_total2 )^2 / (M_total1 )^2 ]

From earlier, M_total1 =1.5 M2, M_total2=5/3 M4.

So,

f1/f2 = ( M2^3 / M4^3 ) * [ ( (5/3 M4 )^2 ) / ( (1.5 M2 )^2 ) ]

= ( M2^3 / M4^3 ) * (25/9 M4² ) / (2.25 M2² )

= ( M2^3 / M4^3 ) * (25/(9*2.25 )) * (M4² / M2² )

= ( M2^(3-2) ) / ( M4^(3-2) ) * (25/(20.25 )) )

= ( M2 / M4 ) * (25/20.25 )

= (M2/M4) * (1.2345 )

We have f1/f2≈0.592.

0.592 = (M2/M4) *1.2345 → M2/M4≈0.479.

Then, M_total1=1.5 M2=1.5 *0.479 M4≈0.7185 M4.

M_total2=5/3 M4≈1.6667 M4.

So,

M_total1 / M_total2≈0.7185 /1.6667≈0.43.

So ratio is ~0.43.

But this contradicts the approach where it's 0.6. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express M_total1 and M_total2.

Wait, system_1:

M1 = (K2/K1) M2 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2.

M_total1 = M1 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

System_2:

M3 = (K4/K3) M4 = (10/15) M4= (2/3) M4.

M_total2 = M3 + M4= (5/3) M4.

Now, the mass ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = (1.5 M2 ) / (5/3 M4 )= (1.5 *3 )/(5 ) * ( M2 / M4 )= (4.5/5) (M2/M4 )= 0.9 (M2/M4 ).

Earlier, we found M2/M4≈0.479. So,

0.9 *0.479≈0.43.

Which brings me back to the same result.

So, the mass ratio is approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the mass function is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity? Or perhaps the mass ratio is independent of the period.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to find the mass ratio based solely on the velocity amplitudes.

If I ignore the periods, then system_1 has a mass ratio of 0.5:1, so total mass 1.5.

System_2 has a mass ratio of 2:3, total mass 5.

So the ratio is 1.5 /5 =0.3. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but that approach is wrong because it ignores the period's effect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass function is the same for both systems, but that's not the case here. Because f1 is 6.79 and f2 is 11.47.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A) ~0.4.

But wait, let me think differently. Maybe the mass ratio is determined by the product of the velocity and the cube root of the period.

Because the formula for K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So, K1 = (M2 sin i ) / ( (M_total1 )^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K3 = (M4 sin i ) / ( (M_total2 )^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

So,

K1 / K3 = [ M2 / (M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ M4 / (M_total2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ]

= (M2 M_total2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) / ( M4 M_total1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

But this seems complicated again.

Alternatively, considering that the total mass is (M_total) = (M1 + M2 ), which is (K2/K1 ) M2 + M2 = M2 (1 + K2/K1 ) = M2 (1 + 0.5 ) = 1.5 M2.

So,

M_total1 =1.5 M2.

Similarly, M_total2 = (M3 + M4 )= M4 (1 + K4/K3 ) = M4 (1 + 2/3 )= (5/3) M4.

So,

M_total1 =1.5 M2,

M_total2=1.6667 M4.

But we also have the mass function ratio approach, which gave us M2=0.479 M4.

So,

M_total1=1.5 *0.479 M4=0.7185 M4.

M_total2=1.6667 M4.

So,

M_total1 / M_total2=0.7185/1.6667≈0.43.

So the answer is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4).

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7.

Wait, but the problem says 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2'. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. The factor is about 0.43, which is option A.

But wait, wait, this seems a bit ambiguous because the options don't have 0.43. So maybe the intended approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio is just the cube of the velocity ratio.

Wait, another approach: the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P )/294.3.

So for system_1: f1 = (10^3 * 2 )/294.3≈6.79.

For system_2: f2 = (15^3 *1 )/294.3≈11.47.

The mass function f(M) is proportional to (M2^3 )/( (M_total )^2 )

Assuming that sin i is the same for both systems, perhaps we can take the ratio of f1 and f2 and relate it to the mass ratios.

But without knowing the exact masses, perhaps it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of each system is proportional to the cube of the velocity amplitudes multiplied by the period.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the intended approach is to find the mass ratio based solely on the velocity amplitudes, ignoring periods. But that would be incorrect because the velocities depend on the period.

But perhaps the answer is 0.6, which is option B.

Wait, let me think. If I assume that the mass ratio is (sum of velocities) for each system and compare.

System_1: K1 + K2=15.

System_2: K3+K4=25.

So 15/25=0.6. So the factor is 0.6, meaning system_1 is 0.6 times as massive as system_2. So the answer would be option B) ~0.6.

But why would the sum of velocities be relevant? Because each velocity is inversely proportional to the mass of the other star.

Wait, the sum of the velocities is (K1 + K2 )= (10 +5 )=15.

(K3 +K4 )=15+10=25.

So the ratio is 15/25=0.6.

But why would the sum of velocities relate to the mass?

Alternatively, each K is proportional to (M_other )/(M_total^(1/3) P^(1/3) )

But without knowing P, it's tricky.

But the periods are given. So for system_1, P=2 years; system_2, P=1 year.

If I write K1 = (M2 sin i )/( (M_total1 )^(1/3) (P1 )^(1/3) )

Similarly, K3 = (M4 sin i )/( (M_total2 )^(1/3) (P2 )^(1/3) )

So,

K1 / K3 = [ M2 (P2 )^(1/3) (M_total2 )^(1/3) ] / [ M4 (P1 )^(1/3) (M_total1 )^(1/3) ]

But from earlier, M_total1=1.5 M2, M_total2=5/3 M4.

So,

K1 / K3 = [ M2 (1 )^(1/3) ( (5/3 M4 ) )^(1/3) ] / [ M4 (2 )^(1/3) (1.5 M2 )^(1/3) ]

Simplify:

= [ M2 (5/3 )^(1/3) M4^(1/3) ) ] / [ M4 (2 )^(1/3) (1.5 )^(1/3) M2^(1/3) ) ]

= [ M2^(1 -1/3) * (5/3 )^(1/3) ) ] / [ M4^(1 -1/3) * (2 *1.5 )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

M2^(2/3) * (5/3 )^(1/3 ) / [ M4^(2/3) * (3 )^(1/3 ) ]

Because 2 *1.5=3.

= [ (M2/M4 )^(2/3) * (5/3 )^(1/3) ) ] / (3^(1/3) )

= ( M2/M4 )^(2/3) * (5/(3 *3 ))^(1/3 )

Wait, 5/3 divided by 3 is 5/(9).

Wait, (5/3 )^(1/3 ) / (3 )^(1/3 ) )= (5/3 )^(1/3 ) * (3^(-1/3 )) )= (5/3^2 )^(1/3 )= (5/9 )^(1/3 ).

So,

K1/K3 = (M2/M4 )^(2/3) * (5/9 )^(1/3 )

We know K1=10, K3=15.

So K1/K3=10/15=2/3 ≈0.6667.

So,

0.6667= (M2/M4 )^(2/3) * (5/9 )^(1/3 )

Compute (5/9 )^(1/3 )≈ (0.5556 )^(0.333 )≈0.82.

So,

0.6667 ≈ (M2/M4 )^(2/3 ) * 0.82.

Divide both sides by 0.82:

(M2/M4 )^(2/3 )≈0.6667 /0.82 ≈0.813.

Take both sides to the power of 3/2:

(M2/M4 )≈ (0.813 )^(3/2 )≈ sqrt(0.813^3 )

0.813^3≈0.813 *0.813 *0.813 ≈ approx 0.537.

sqrt(0.537 )≈0.733.

So M2/M4≈0.733.

So M_total1=1.5 M2=1.5 *0.733 M4≈1.0995 M4.

M_total2=5/3 M4≈1.6667 M4.

So,

M_total1/M_total2≈1.0995 /1.6667 ≈0.66.

So system_1 is approximately 0.66 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is ~0.66, which is close to option B (~0.6). But that's not matching earlier results.

This is getting really confusing. I think I'm making a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Maybe I should go back to the basics.

The correct approach is:

The velocity amplitude K of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5 → M1/M2 =5/10=0.5 → M1=0.5 M2.

Total mass system_1: M1 + M2 =1.5 M2.

For system_2, K3=15, K4=10 → M3/M4=10/15=2/3 → M3= (2/3) M4.

Total mass system_2: M3 + M4= (5/3) M4.

Now, to find the ratio of the total masses, we need M_total1 =1.5 M2 and M_total2= (5/3) M4.

But without a relation between M2 and M4, we can't compute M_total1/M_total2 directly. So we need another approach.

The other approach is to use the mass function, which includes the period.

The mass function f(M)= (K^3 P )/(294.3 )=( M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M_total )^2 )

Assuming sin i is the same for both systems.

So,

f1 = (10^3 *2 )/294.3≈6.79.

f1= (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (1.5 M2 )^2 )= (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( 2.25 M2^2 )= (M2 sin^3 i )/2.25.

Similarly,

f2= (15^3 *1)/294.3≈11.47.

f2= (M4^3 sin^3 i )/( (5/3 M4 )^2 )= (M4^3 sin^3 i )/( (25/9) M4^2 )= (9 M4 sin^3 i )/(25 )

So,

f1 = (M2 sin³ i )/2.25 → M2 = (f1 *2.25 )/( sin³ i )

f2 = (9 M4 sin³ i )/(25 ) → M4= (25 f2 )/(9 sin³ i )

So,

M2 = (6.79 *2.25 ) / sin³ i ≈15.3525 / sin³ i.

M4= (25 *11.47 )/(9 sin³ i ) ≈300.25 / (9 sin³ i )≈33.361 / sin³ i.

So, M2/M4= (15.3525 ) / (33.361 )≈0.46.

So, M2=0.46 M4.

Now,

M_total1=1.5 M2=1.5*0.46 M4=0.69 M4.

M_total2=5/3 M4≈1.6667 M4.

So,

M_total1/M_total2=0.69 /1.6667≈0.414.

Which is ~0.41, matching the earlier result.

So, the answer is approximately 0.41, which is closest to option A (~0.4).


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, masses, and orbital periods.

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( M_1 / M_2 = K_2 / K_1 = 5 / 10 = 0.5 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 0.5 M_2 + M_2 = 1.5 M_2 \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_3 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_4 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( M_3 / M_4 = K_4 / K_3 = 10 / 15 = 2/3 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_3 + M_4 = (2/3) M_4 + M_4 = (5/3) M_4 \)

### Step 1: Relating \( M_2 \) and \( M_4 \)
Using the mass function:
\[
f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{294.3} = \frac{M_2^3 \sin^3 i}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^2} \quad \text{(System_1)}
\]
\[
f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{294.3} = \frac{M_4^3 \sin^3 i}{(M_{\text{total,2}})^2} \quad \text{(System_2)}
\]
Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{\frac{M_2^3 \sin^3 i}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^2}}{\frac{M_4^3 \sin^3 i}{(M_{\text{total,2}})^2}} = \frac{M_2^3}{M_4^3} \cdot \frac{(M_{\text{total,2}})^2}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^2}
\]
Substituting \( M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_2 \) and \( M_{\text{total,2}} = (5/3) M_4 \):
\[
\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{M_2^3}{M_4^3} \cdot \frac{(5/3 M_4)^2}{(1.5 M_2)^2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{M_2^3}{M_4^3} \cdot \frac{(25/9) M_4^2}{(2.25) M_2^2} = \frac{M_2}{M_4} \cdot \frac{25}{20.25} \approx \frac{M_2}{M_4} \cdot 1.2345
\]
From \( f_1 = 6.79 \) and \( f_2 = 11.47 \):
\[
\frac{f_1}{f_2} \approx \frac{6.79}{11.47} \approx 0.592
\]
Thus:
\[
0.592 \approx \frac{M_2}{M_4} \cdot 1.2345 \implies \frac{M_2}{M_4} \approx \frac{0.592}{1.2345} \approx 0.479
\]

### Step 2: Total Mass Ratio
Substitute \( M_2 = 0.479 M_4 \) into the total masses:
\[
M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_2 = 1.5 \cdot 0.479 M_4 \approx 0.7185 M_4
\]
\[
M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{3} M_4 \approx 1.6667 M_4
\]
The ratio of total masses:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} \approx \frac{0.7185 M_4}{1.6667 M_4} \approx 0.43
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
System_1 is approximately \( 0.43 \) times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **A (~0.4)**.

Answer: A
