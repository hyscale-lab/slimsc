Okay, so I have this question about identifying an organic compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, the FTIR part. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So that makes me think the compound has a carboxylic acid group because those have broad O-H stretches. The other peak at 1700 cm^-1 is a strong absorption. I recall that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids) absorb around there. But since we already have the O-H from the carboxylic acid, the 1700 peak must be the carbonyl in the carboxylic acid. So the compound has a -COOH group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl would be like CH2=CH, so no double bondsâ€”maybe the compound is more branched or has a structure without any double bonds. 

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Oh wait, that's a mouthful. I need to visualize splitting patterns. Let's break it down. A doublet means each peak is split into two, so perhaps two neighboring protons. But then each of those is a triplet? Wait, maybe it's a more complex coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal coupling (like -CH2-CH2-), but with more neighbors.

Another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's even more splitting. That sounds like a proton that's coupled with multiple sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a branching point where each proton is adjacent to multiple different groups.

Let me think about the possible structures. The options are all diasterotopic structures, perhaps. Let me look at the options:

Option A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, that would be something like:
CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH
So, the central two CH groups each have a methyl and ethyl substituent. So each of those CH groups would have two neighboring groups: the CH on either side, plus the substituents.

Option B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So here, the two CH groups each have a CH2CH3 and a C2H5 group. Wait, no, wait: the substituents on the CH are C2H5 and another group?

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures. Let me think:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Structure would be CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So all the options have a -COOH at one end, and branching in the middle. The main difference is where the substituents are attached.

Now, in the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens suggests no double bonds, so likely all single bonds. So the substituents are either methyl or ethyl groups attached to the central carbons.

Looking at the possible structures, the key is to figure out the splitting in the NMR.

Let me think about Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So each CH has a CH3 and (C2H5) group attached. Wait, no. Wait, for Option A, the substituents are (C2H5) on each CH. So each CH is connected to a CH3 and another CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps I should think about each CH group. For example, in Option A, the two central CH groups each have a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So each CH is adjacent to two substituents, and perhaps each has neighboring CH groups.

Wait, but perhaps it's more about the splitting in the NMR. Let's consider each CH group. Each CH would have protons that are split by neighboring groups.

In a scenario where a CH has two adjacent CH groups (on either side), each with different substituents, the proton would be split by the neighboring groups.

Let me think of the possible coupling. Suppose we have a structure
