Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Optical activity means the compound has chirality, right? Chirality occurs when a molecule has a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or when there's another form of asymmetry, like a plane of symmetry missing. But wait, some compounds have multiple stereocenters but might not be chiral overall if they have a plane of symmetry or are meso compounds.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Hmm, this is a diene with a double bond. The configuration is Z, which is about the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. But for a molecule to be chiral, it needs a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is CH2ClCH(CH3)CH2. Wait, no, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. Structure: Cl is on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH2, and the double bond (so maybe two substituents on C1: Cl and CH2-CH(CH3)? Wait, no, maybe better to think of the structure as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, perhaps it's C(CCl)=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2. Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. So C1: Cl, double bond, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, butene is four carbons, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C
