Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with multiple substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let's try to break it down.

The question says that a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So, that means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon (since meta is 1,3 positions). Wait, noâ€”meta means that each is two positions away from each other, right? Like, positions 1, 3, 5 on the ring.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group here because it's a higher priority than aldehyde and nitrile. So, the numbering should start from the carboxylic acid as position 1.

Wait, no, actually, the substituents are all meta to each other, but the carboxylic acid is one of them. Wait, the three groups are carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano, all meta. So each of them is in a position that's meta to the others. So, perhaps positions 1,3,5? Let me visualize the benzene ring.

Hold on, the carboxylic acid is in position 1. Then, the other two (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be in 3 and 5. But wait, the question says they are all meta to one another, which would require them to be in 1, 3, and 5 positions. So that makes sense.

Now, the ortho positions to the carboxylic acid (which is position 1) would be 2 and 6. According to the question, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So, positions 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2, but I'm not sure which is which yet. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position to 1 is position 4. So position 4 has OCH3.

Additionally, the methoxy group (position 4) and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is the cyano group, which is either in position 3 or 5.
