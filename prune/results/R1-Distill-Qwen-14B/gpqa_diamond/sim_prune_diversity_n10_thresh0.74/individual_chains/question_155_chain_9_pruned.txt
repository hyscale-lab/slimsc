Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because in that basis, the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal.

Wait, the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Let me write them down.

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

Since the basis is of P_z's eigenvectors, the state vector is already in that basis. So the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I think I just take the inner product of ψ with P_z acting on ψ. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in this basis, each component in the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Because the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state components are c1, c2, c3. The eigenvalues for each component are ħ, 0, -ħ respectively. So ⟨P_z⟩ is sum |ci|^2 * (eigenvalue for that component).

Wait, let's see. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. The probabilities are the square of the absolute values of each component.

So for the first component, | -1/2 |² = 1/4. P_z eigenvalue here is ħ, so contributes (1/4)*ħ.

Second component: |1/√2 |² = 1/2. Eigenvalue is 0, so contributes nothing.

Third component: | -1/2 |² = 1/4. Eigenvalue is -ħ, so contributes (1/4)*(-ħ).

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4
