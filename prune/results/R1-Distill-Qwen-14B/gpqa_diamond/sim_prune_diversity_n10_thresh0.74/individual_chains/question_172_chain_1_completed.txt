Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are in a specific energy level, their excitation depends on temperature. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I think this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor, right. The number of atoms in an excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, which is e^(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So, if the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, that probably relates to the ratio of their populations. Let me denote the population in star_1 as N1 and star_2 as N2. The problem states that N1 = 2 * N2.

But wait, the ratio of N1 to N2 would be [ (g1/g2) * e^(-ΔE/(k*T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) * e^(-ΔE/(k*T2)) ]? Or maybe I should consider that the ratio is N1/N2 = [e^(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [e^(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] because if all else is equal, like the statistical weights are the same, they cancel out.

So N1/N2 = e^[ (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, let me re-calculate that exponent. The exponential term for N1 is e^(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for N2 it's e^(-ΔE/(k T2)). So when you take the ratio N1/N2, it's [e^{-ΔE/(k T1)}] / [e^{-ΔE/(k T2)}] = e^{ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1))}.

Oh wait, no, because when you subtract exponents, it's e^{a - b} = e^{a} / e^{b}.

Wait, let me think again. Let's denote x = ΔE/(k). So N1/N2 = e^{(x / T2) - (x / T1)} } = e^{ x (1/T2 - 1/T1) }.

Wait, no, because N1 is proportional to e^{-x/T1} and N2 to e^{-x/T2}, so the ratio N1/N2 is e^{( -x/T1 + x/T2 )} = e^{x (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) }.

We are given that N1 = 2 N2, so N1/N2 = 2.

So 2 = e^{ (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) }.

Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Hmm, wait, that's ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) times (1/T2 - 1/T1). Let's rearrange that equation.

But wait, the problem gives the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but in the equation, we have ΔE/(k), and I remember that k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, so ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/k would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) )= 1 K.

So substituting, ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Hmm, but wait, 1/T2 minus 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches this equation.

Let me double-check the steps. The key was using the ratio of the populations, which comes from the Boltzmann distribution. Since star_1 has higher excitation, it's hotter? Well, if T1 is higher, then 1/T1 is smaller, so 1/T2 -1/T1 would be positive if T2 < T1. So if T1 > T2, then (T1-T2) is positive, and denominator is positive, so the right side is positive, which matches ln(2) positive.

So the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 is twice that of star_2. This excitation difference can be explained using the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of atoms in different energy levels to temperature. Specifically, the ratio of the populations of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = e^{\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)}
\]

Here, \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the populations of excited atoms in star_1 and star_2, respectively, \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the effective temperatures of the two stars.

Since \(N_1 = 2N_2\), the ratio \(N_1/N_2 = 2\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
2 = e^{\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)
\]

Noting that \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}
\]

Rearranging the terms:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it does not account for the temperature dependence in the denominator.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it introduces an unnecessary term involving \(T_1 + T_2\).
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it incorrectly includes a squared term in the denominator.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
\]

Answer: D
