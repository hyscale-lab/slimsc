Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Lagrangian problem. Hmm, the question gives a Lagrangian term and asks about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is calculated based on ensuring that the dimensions match. The action must be dimensionless in natural units (since it's integrated over spacetime, which has dimension [d] = -4? Wait, no. Wait, in 4 dimensions, spacetime is 4-dimensional, so each derivative is dimensionless? Or wait, no.

Wait, let me get the basics right. In quantum field theory, the dimensions are in terms of mass [M]. Each field has a certain mass dimension, and each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (since exp(i S) must be dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian density must be of mass dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian is integrated over d^4x, which has dimension -4 (since each coordinate x has dimension -1 in mass units, so (d^4x) has dimension -4), so the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4 (since when multiplied by d^4x, which is dimension -4, the whole action is dimensionless, 4-4=0).

So, for any term in the Lagrangian, its mass dimension must be 4. So the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Let's break down each component.

First, I'll note the fields and their dimensions. For a Dirac spinor ψ, in 4 dimensions, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because I remember that for a Dirac field, [ψ] = 3/2. How? Because the Dirac equation is (i γ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ =0, so each term must have the same dimension. ∂_μ has dimension 1, so (i γ ∂)ψ must have same dimension as m ψ. m has dimension 1, so [ψ] must be 3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} for electromagnetism is a field strength tensor. Wait, but if this is a non-Abelian theory? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is the same as in QED. But regardless, F^{mu nu} is a field strength tensor. Let me think about its dimension. In QED, A_mu has dimension 1, since the covariant derivative has ∂_mu plus i e A_mu, which must have the same dimension as ∂_mu (which is 1). So A_mu has dimension 1. The field strength tensor F_{mu nu} is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each term is ∂ A, which is dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So [F^{mu nu}] = 2.
