Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, given some elemental abundance data.

Let me first read the problem carefully. The two stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. But I think the mass might not be directly relevant here since the problem is about abundances, which are given using the EW method under LTE. 

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what do these mean? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) base 10, so [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of iron abundance relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. 

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means their Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Same for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg/nH is same as in Sun for Star_2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need [Si]_1 / [Si]_2, where [Si] is the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen.

Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms would be n_Si1 / n_Si2, but if I'm given [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then the ratio is 10^{ ([Si/H]_1
