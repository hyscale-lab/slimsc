Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like an electrostatic potential energy problem. I remember that the potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula, right? The formula for potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, since we're dealing with multiple charges, I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up.

Wait, but wait. The system has 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is fixed, which means it's not moving. The other 12 are each 2 meters from P, but are they all at the same point or spread out in a sphere? Oh, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so their distance from P is fixed, but their positions relative to each other might vary. But for the minimum potential energy, I think they would all be as far apart as possible, but wait, no, wait. No, wait, wait. Wait a second, no. Because when you have multiple charges, their arrangement affects the total potential energy. But wait, in this case, all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, I think that the minimum potential energy occurs when the charges are as close as possible, but wait, no—wait, actually, wait. How does the potential energy depend on the separation between the charges?

Wait, no. Wait, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, each pair contributes to the total. So, for the minimum energy, I think that would be the configuration where the potential energy is minimized. Wait, but wait, wait—since each charge is identical and positive or negative? Oh, wait, the problem says "each with charge 2e"—so 2 times the elementary charge. But the elementary charge could be positive or negative. Wait, the question doesn't specify whether the charges are positive or negative. Oh, but in this context, it's probably positive because electrons are negative, but protons are positive. But wait, 2e could be either. Hmm. Well, maybe it doesn't matter because the square would make it positive either way.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy." So, if the charges are positive, bringing them closer would increase the potential energy, because like charges repel. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive. So, for positive charges, the potential energy is positive, and to minimize the energy, you would want to have the potential energy as low as possible, which would mean putting the charges as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So, their positions relative to P are fixed, but their mutual distances can vary.

Wait, but how? Because each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their distance from each other depends on how they are arranged around P. For example, if they are all on the same circle of radius 2m, spaced equally, their mutual distances would be larger than if they were bunched together. So, to minimize the potential energy, I would arrange the charges as far apart as possible from each other. Because the potential energy between each pair is positive, so to minimize the total potential energy (make it as small as possible), you need to maximize the distances between the charges so that each term in the sum is as small as possible.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, if the charges are positive, bringing them closer together would mean each pair's potential energy increases (becomes more positive), which would increase the total potential energy. So, to minimize the total potential energy, you want to arrange the charges as far apart as possible. But in this setup, the 12 charges are all fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So, to minimize the total potential energy, you want to arrange them in such a way that the mutual distances are maximized, meaning that each pair is as far apart as possible. So, the configuration that maximizes the distances between the charges would be when all 12 are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m. But wait, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe in this problem, the mutual distances aren't considered because they're all at the same distance from P, but the problem simplifies by considering each of the 12 charges as being at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simpler. Let me think: The fixed charge at P is 2e. Then, each of the 12 charges is 2e and at 2 meters from P. So, the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is the same. So, for each of the 12, the potential energy is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m), and there are 12 of them. Additionally, there are the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges, which are each 2e and separated by some distance.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So, perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are minimized. But wait, if the 12 charges are all the same sign, their mutual potential energies are positive, so the minimal possible would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. Alternatively, the problem might not require considering their mutual interactions, perhaps because they are so arranged that their mutual distances are all 2 meters apart from each other, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not considered, or perhaps because the problem is looking for the energy due to the fixed charge and the others, but not their mutual interactions. Hmm, but the question says it's the total energy of the system, so it must include all interactions.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

The system consists of 13 charges. Let's denote them as Q1, Q2, ..., Q13. Q13 is fixed at P, so it doesn't move. The other 12 (Q1-Q12) are each at a distance of 2 meters from P.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with Q13. So, the potential energy between each Qi and Q13 is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2), since the distance is 2 meters.

So, each of these 12 terms contributes U_i = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

So, for 12 charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

Now, the other part is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Each pair (Qi, Qj) where i ≠ j contributes U_pair = k*(2e)*(2e)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between Qi and Qj.

So, the total potential energy from all these pairs is the sum over all i < j of [k*(4e²)/(r_ij)].

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So, to find the minimum, we need to arrange the 12 charges such that the sum of 1/(r_ij) is maximized, because each term is positive. Wait, because U_pair is positive (since 4e² is positive, unless the charges are negative), but if the charges are positive, then the more they're separated, the smaller each term is, thus the sum is minimized. Wait, no. Wait, if the charges are positive, their mutual repulsion makes the potential energy positive. To minimize the total potential energy, you want to maximize the distances between the charges, as that would make each 1/r_ij term as small as possible, thus each U_pair as small as possible. So, the minimum total potential energy would be when all the 12 charges are as far apart as possible. But how far apart can they be?

Wait, but all the 12 charges are constrained to be 2 meters from P. So, the maximum possible mutual distance between any two charges would be when they are on opposite sides of P, making their separation 4 meters. But wait, no, because each is at a distance of 2 meters from P, the maximum distance between any two would be 4 meters (if they are diametrically opposed). But wait, if they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, the maximum distance between any two would be 4 m, but the minimal distance would be when they are adjacent on the sphere.

But for the minimal total potential energy, we need to arrange them in such a way that the sum of 1/r_ij is as small as possible. Wait, no, because each term is 1/r_ij multiplied by a positive constant. So, if r_ij is as large as possible, each term is as small as possible, so the sum is as small as possible. So yes, to minimize the sum of 1/r_ij, we arrange the charges as far apart as possible.

But wait, the problem is that the 12 charges are all at a fixed distance from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So, perhaps the minimal potential energy occurs when the charges are all equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m around P, such that the sum of 1/r_ij for all pairs is minimized.

But wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe there's a simpler way to model this. Perhaps the problem neglects the interactions between the 12 charges because their distances are much larger than the distance from P, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to only consider the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem becomes more complicated, especially because the mutual distances between the 12 charges would vary depending on their arrangement.

Wait, but the problem states it's an isolated system, so all interactions must be considered. So, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

But calculating all those pairs seems difficult, especially for 12 charges. So perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the mutual potential energies are negligible or can be ignored, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in a way where the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are all 4 meters. Wait, that can't be right, because if all 12 are on the same line, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps they are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered as all 12 charges being at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. But that's impossible unless all 12 are at the same point, which would make their mutual potential energy very high. But that would require them to be at zero distance, which can't be the case.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question is about the minimum energy, so perhaps the mutual potential energies are to be considered as zero. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the system is arranged in such a way that the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies are zero. That's not possible unless they are arranged in a neutral configuration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies cancel out. But that's not possible because all are like charges. If the charges are positive, their mutual interactions would all contribute positive potential energy, so the sum can't be zero.

Wait, perhaps the minimal energy only includes the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P. That is, maybe the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are not considered, perhaps because they are constrained or because the problem is simplified. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Let me try that approach. If I only consider the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge. So, each has a potential energy of U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = (k*(4e²))/2 = 2k e².

So, for 12 charges, the total is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

But then I'm missing the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. So, perhaps the problem expects me to include those.

Wait, but how many mutual pairs are there among 12 charges? The number of pairs is C(12, 2) = (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between each pair.

But unless we know the exact arrangement, we can't compute the exact sum. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so perhaps the minimal sum occurs when the mutual distances are as large as possible, which would minimize each term.

Wait, but all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, so the maximum possible distance between any two charges is 4 meters (if they're on opposite sides of P). But the average distance would depend on the arrangement.

Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that the mutual distances are all 2 meters as well. No, that's not possible because if each charge is 2 m from P, two charges can't both be 2 m from P and 2 m apart from each other unless they are on a straight line through P. But in that case, the distance between them would be 4 m, not 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not considered, and the problem only wants the potential energy from the 12 charges and the fixed one, not their mutual interactions. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters. But that's impossible unless they are all at the same point, which would give infinite potential energy, which is not minimal.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the other 12, and not their mutual interactions. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of each of those 12 interactions.

So, let's calculate that. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

So, each of the 12 charges has a potential energy with the 13th charge of (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

Which is (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

There are 12 such charges, so the total U is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Do I need to include that? If the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, then that's all. But if it's a complete system, I must include all interactions.

But the problem statement says, "the minimum energy of this system." So, the system's energy includes all the interactions. Therefore, I can't ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges.

But how to calculate that without knowing their exact arrangement?

Wait, perhaps there's a way to model this without considering the specific arrangement. Wait, but without knowing the mutual distances, I can't compute the sum. So, perhaps the intended approach is to consider only the interactions between the 12 charges and the 13th, not their mutual interactions.

Wait, but that would not give the correct minimal energy, because the mutual interactions contribute a significant amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 m from each other as well, but that's not physically possible unless all are at the same point, which isn't the case.

Wait, maybe the mutual potential energies cancel each other out, but that's only possible if some are positive and some are negative, which they aren't all the same sign. Wait, wait, the problem states that each charge is 2e. So, if all are positive, their mutual interactions are all positive. So, the sum can't be zero. But wait, if some are positive and some are negative, but the problem says all are 2e. So, same charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm overcomplicating, and the mutual interactions are to be neglected. Let me proceed under that assumption.

So, the total potential energy would be 24 k e².

Let me compute that value. Let me get the values:

k = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602 x 10^-19 C

So, 4e² = 4*(1.602e-19)^2 = 4*(2.566e-38) = 1.026e-37 C².

Then, each U_i is 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. U_i is (k*(2e)*(2e))/r, which is (k *4e²) / r.

r is 2 meters, so U_i = (k *4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So, for each of the 12 charges, U_i = 2 k e².

So, total U from these is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

So, let's compute the numerical value.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C

So,

24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let me compute the exponents first: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29. So, 8.988 * 2.566 is approximately 23.07.

So, 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Then, multiply by 24: 24 * 2.307e-28 = 55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27 J.

Wait, but that's just the energy from the interactions with the fixed charge. What about the mutual interactions between the 12 charges?

Hmm, this is a problem because the mutual interactions would add more energy, making the total higher. But the problem is asking for the minimal energy, so perhaps I'm supposed to find the minimal possible total energy, which would include the mutual interactions in the way that makes them as small as possible.

Wait, but without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to compute exactly. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions, as perhaps they are not part of the problem's intended solution.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1/7.8 of the 5.5368e-27 J I just calculated. So that doesn't seem to match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the 24 * k * e² term more accurately.

Let me compute it step by step.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then, (k * 4e²) / 2 = 2k e².

Wait, no, wait. For each of the 12 charges, the potential energy is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 = (k *4e²)/2 = 2k e².

So, 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let's compute that:

8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 * 2.566) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

Multiplying 8.988 by 2.566 gives approximately 23.07 (since 8*2.566=20.528, 0.988*2.566≈2.543, total about 23.07).

So, 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.614e-28 J per charge. Wait, no, wait. No, per charge, the U is 2k e², which is 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 /2.

Wait, no, no, wait.

Wait, no, the calculation I did earlier for 2k e²: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28 J. Then, 2k e² is 2 * that? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 2k e² is 2 * (k e²), but I think I may have confused the steps.

Wait, let's go back.

Each U_i = (k*(2e)*(2e))/2 = (4k e²)/2 = 2k e².

So, 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 N·m²/C² * (1.602e-19 C)^2.

Which is 2 * 8.988e9 * (2.566e-38) = 2 * (8.988e9 * 2.566e-38).

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.07.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So, 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.614e-28 J.

So, each U_i is 4.614e-28 J, and there are 12 of them.

Total U = 12 * 4.614e-28 = 55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27 J.

But that's only considering the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 charges. Now, we need to consider the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Each pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij = (4k e²)/r_ij.

But the problem is, without knowing r_ij for each pair, it's impossible to compute the exact sum. So, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore this part, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters. But that can't be, because each is constrained to be 2 meters from P, so their mutual distance can't all be 2 meters. For example, arranging them in a regular icosahedron around P would give some mutual distances larger than 2 meters and some smaller.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that all 12 charges are at a mutual distance of 2 meters. But that's impossible unless they are all at the same point, which would give an infinite potential energy, which isn't minimal.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not the mutual interactions. Let's see what the options are.

The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330

Wait, the value I calculated, 5.5368e-27 J, is close to option C, which is 7.056e-27 J. But it's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the 2k e² term.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = approx 23.07, as before. So, 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 2: 4.614e-28 J per charge.

Wait, but each charge contributes 4.614e-28 J, so 12 charges contribute 12 *4.614e-28 = 55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J, which is larger than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the distance is not 2 meters, but 2 meters from P, but the fixed charge is at P, so the distance between the 13th charge (at P) and each of the 12 is 2 m. So, that part is correct.

Another possibility is that I forgot to include that the 13th charge is one of the 13, so the 12 charges are the others. So, the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum potential energy, but the configuration that minimizes the potential energy would require that all the 12 charges are as far away as possible from each other. So, perhaps the minimal potential energy is when the 12 charges are arranged so that their mutual distances are maximized, thus minimizing each U_ij, which is positive, so the overall sum is as small as possible.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to compute the exact sum. So perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual interactions are zero, which is only possible if the charges are arranged in a way that they are symmetrically placed, leading to mutual potential energies canceling out. But that's only possible if the charges are of opposite signs, which they are not.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energies are all positive, but for the minimal total energy, the sum of the mutual energies is the minimal possible, which would occur when all the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to only consider the interactions with the fixed charge, and not the mutual ones.

In that case, the total energy would be 5.5368e-27 J, which is approximately 5.537e-27 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 7.056e-27 J. But that's higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 2k e². Let me recompute that.

Compute 2k e²: 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: 2.566e-38.

So, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 is 8.988 x1e9.

2.566e-38 is 2.566 x1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.07.

Multiply the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So, 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.614e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.614e-28 *12 = 55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27 J.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. The options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D) 122.330

Wait, option C is about 7e-27, which is larger than my 5.5e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me check:

(1.602e-19 C)^2 = (1.602)^2 x (1e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, 2k e² = 2 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 = approx 23.07; exponents: 1e9 *1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.614e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12: 4.614e-28 *12 = 5.5368e-27 J.

So, it's 5.5368e-27 J. The closest option to this is option C (7.056e-27) but it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 10^9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 x 10^-38.

Multiply 8.988 *2.566:

Let me compute 8 *2.566 =20.528.

0.988 *2.566 = approx 2.543.

So total 20.528 +2.543 =23.071.

So 23.071e9-38 =23.071e-29 =2.3071e-28.

Multiply by 2:4.6142e-28.

Multiply by 12:4.6142e-28 *12=5.537e-27.

So it's about 5.537e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is 1.32 times higher.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units? Let me check.

Wait, 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, each U_i is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2 = (4k e²)/2 = 2k e². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, 2k e² = 2 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it precisely.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 = 2.566, so 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = ?

2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = (2.566 *8.988) *1e-38+9 =23.07 *1e-29 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2:4.614e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.5368e-27 J.

So, my calculation seems correct.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is 2e, but the others are 2e as well. So, each pair contributes (2e)(2e) =4e².

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered that the 13th charge is fixed and the others are moving, but perhaps the potential energy formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered each pair once, but I multiplied by 12 and didn't account for something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fixed charge (13th) is at P, and the 12 charges are each at 2 m from P. So, each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = 2k e².

But the 13th charge is fixed; it only interacts with the other 12. So, the total potential energy is 12*2k e².

But wait, when considering potential energy, each pair is counted once. So, the 13th charge with each of the 12 is 12 interactions.

So, perhaps that part is correct.

But then why doesn't any option match 5.537e-27 J?

Looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J. Hmm. Let me see what 5.537e-27 is. It's about 5.537e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is one of the 13 charges, so the question is about 13 charges, 12 of which are at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are 2 meters as well, but that's impossible unless they are arranged on a regular dodecahedron, but then the mutual distances would vary.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges is at a mutual distance of 4 meters from each other, but that's only possible if they're all on opposite ends of P. But more likely, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges and only calculate the potential energy between each and the fixed charge.

In that case, the total U is 5.537e-27 J. But none of the options match this exactly.

Looking back at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately 1.27 times larger than my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me check:

Wait, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 2 gives 4.614e-28.

Multiply by 12 gives 55.368e-28 = 5.5368e-27.

Hmm, perhaps the question intended to have the 12 charges at a distance of 1 meter, not 2. Let me check what would happen then.

If r =1 m instead of 2, then U_i = (k*4e²)/1 =4k e².

12 charges: 12*4k e² =48k e².

Compute that: 48 *8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 48:48 *2.307e-28 = 110.736e-28 =1.10736e-26 J.

Which is close to option A:5.645e-26, but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 3 meters. Let me compute for r=3 m.

U_i= (k *4e²)/3= (4/3)k e².

Total:12*(4/3)k e² =16k e².

16 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =16 *2.307e-28=36.91e-28=3.691e-27 J. Still doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy between each pair, including the 13th charge and the others, plus all mutual pairs.

Wait, the 13th charge is at P, so the potential energy between it and each of the 12 is 2k e² per charge, as before.

Now, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges: each pair contributes (4k e²)/r_ij.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem expects an approximate value. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible because their mutual distance would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which isn't minimal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual potential energies cancel each other out, but that's only possible if some are positive and others are negative, which they aren't.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The calculated value when considering only the fixed charge and the others is approximately 5.537e-27 J. The options are A (5.645e-26), B (2.822e-26), C (7.056e-27), D (122.330).

Wait, option C is about 7e-27, which is about 1.27 times my calculated value. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 2k e².

Wait, let me re-calculate e squared:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

So, e² = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approx 2.56696985e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So, 2k e² = 2 *8.9875517879e9 * 2.56696985e-38.

Compute 8.98755e9 *2.56697e-38 = (8.98755 *2.56697) *1e-29.

8.98755 *2.56697 ≈ 23.071.

So, 23.071e-29 =2.3071e-28.

Multiply by 2:4.6142e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.537e-27 J.

So, that's correct.

But looking at the options again, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger than my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each pair, including the 13th charge, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 13th charge is fixed, but the other 12 are moving. So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is the same, but perhaps I should also consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the others.

Wait, but no, the potential energy is a system property, not per charge. So, each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being in the field of the others, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2 m from each other as well as from P. But that's impossible unless all are at the same point, which would give infinite potential energy.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should consider that the minimum energy occurs when the mutual potential energies are zero, which isn't possible, but perhaps the problem is designed that way, leading the total energy to be just the 5.537e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for potential energy in a system of n charges, which is (1/2) * sum U_ij.

Wait, wait, no. The total potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs, each counted once. So, for N charges, it's (1/2) * sum of U_ij for each pair.

But in this problem, the potential energy includes the 13th charge and each of the 12, plus all the pairs among the 12.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions, leading to the energy being 5.537e-27 J, which is not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is worded in such a way that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are also 2 meters. So, perhaps they are arranged in a regular icosahedron around P, each at 2 meters from P and from each other. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, arranging 12 charges all at 2 meters from each other and from P would require a very specific geometry. Let me think: if all 12 are on a sphere of radius 2 m, then the distance between any two would be more than 2 m, except for when they are adjacent.

Wait, no, actually, the minimal distance between any two points on a sphere of radius 2 m would be when they are adjacent, but the distance would be 2 *2 * sin(π/12) ≈ 2 *2 *0.2588 ≈ 1.035 m. So, the distance between adjacent points would be about 1.035 m, which is less than 2 m. So, their mutual distance would be less than 2 m, leading to a higher potential energy.

But in that case, the mutual potential energies would be higher, which would increase the total energy, making the system's energy higher, not lower.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the intended approach is to only consider the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions, perhaps because the mutual distances are considered to be much larger than 2 meters, making their contributions negligible. But that doesn't make sense because the mutual distances can't be much larger than 2 meters when all are constrained to 2 meters from the same point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and then multiply by the number of pairs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their position. So, for the 13th charge, it's fixed at P. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought into place, each at 2 meters from P.

So, the potential energy for each charge is the work done to bring it to its position, which is U = k*(2e)*(2e)/2 = 2k e².

So, for 12 charges, the total is 12*2k e² =24k e².

But again, that's the same as before, leading to 5.537e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is about 7e-27. Let me compute what 24 *k *e² would be if I had made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 24 *k *e².

k=8.988e9.

e²=2.566e-38.

So, 24 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 24:24 *2.307e-28=5.5368e-27 J.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the potential energy in terms of electron volts (eV) and then convert to joules, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should include the potential energy due to the 13th charge itself. But the potential energy of a single charge in its own field is zero, so that's not needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant. For example, using k =9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that. If k=9e9, then:

24 *9e9 *2.566e-38 = 24 *9 *2.566e-29 =24 *23.094e-29 =554.256e-29 =5.54256e-27 J.

Still approximately the same as before.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me look at the options again. The calculated value is about 5.537e-27 J, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again. If the 13th charge is fixed, then the number of interactions is 12 (each of the 12 charges with the fixed one). Additionally, the number of mutual pairs among the 12 charges is C(12,2) =66 pairs.

But without knowing the distances, I can't compute the mutual interactions. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore them, leading to 5.537e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that each of the 12 charges is at a mutual distance of 2 meters from each other, which would require them to be arranged in a regular dodecahedron with each edge 2 meters. But I'm not sure if that's possible, and even then, the mutual distances would vary.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 meters. Let me compute the mutual potential energy in that case.

Each mutual pair contributes U_ij = (4k e²)/(2) =2k e².

There are 66 pairs, so the mutual potential energy is 66 * 2k e²=132k e².

Adding that to the 24k e² from the fixed charge interactions: total U=156k e².

156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 =2.307e-28.

Multiply by 156:156 *2.307e-28=360.012e-28=3.60012e-26 J.

Which is close to option A:5.645e-26. But not exact.

Hmm. But this seems way higher than the options given. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5.6e-26 J.

Wait, but in this scenario, I'm assuming that each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from each other, which isn't possible unless they are arranged in a very specific way, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, but that would require more information.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in electron volts (eV) rather than joules. Let me compute that.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So, 5.537e-27 J /1.602e-19 J/eV ≈3.456e-8 eV.

But the options are in joules, so that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 others are at 2 meters, but their mutual distances are negligible, meaning their mutual potential energies are negligible. So, the total energy is 5.537e-27 J.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 form a regular dodecahedron around it, leading to each charge being 2 meters from P and a certain mutual distance. But without knowing the mutual distance, I can't calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a trick question, and the minimal energy is zero, but that's not possible because all charges are positive.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations I've done, the value when considering only the fixed charge interactions is approximately 5.537e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem expects me to consider other factors.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential energy in the field of all other charges. So, for each charge, the potential energy is the sum of potentials from all other charges.

But for the 13th charge (fixed at P), its potential energy is due to the 12 charges, each at 2 meters. So, the potential at P is V = sum of (k*(2e)/2) for each of the 12 charges.

So, V =12 * (k*(2e)/2) =12 *k e.

Then, the potential energy of the 13th charge is U = q * V = (2e) * V =2e *12k e=24k e².

Which is the same as before.

Similarly, each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, and the potential at their position is due to the 13th charge (at P) and the other 11 charges.

The potential from the 13th charge is V13 =k*(2e)/2 =k e.

The potential from each of the other 11 charges depends on their distance. If each of the 12 charges is equally spaced around P at 2 meters, then the distance between any two of them is greater than zero, but the exact value depends on the arrangement.

But without knowing the exact mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate each mutual distance as 2 meters, but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are all 2 meters, leading to each pair contributing (4k e²)/(2) =2k e². There are 66 such pairs, so mutual U =66 *2k e²=132k e².

Adding the 24k e² from the fixed charge interactions, the total U=156k e²=156*8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.307e-28.

Multiply by 156:156 *2.307e-28=360.012e-28=3.60012e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.6e-26 J. But the closest option is A:5.645e-26, which is higher.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I've tried all possible angles. Based on the initial calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 5.54e-27 J, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C (7.056e-27 J), which is close to my calculation but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again. The 12 charges each interact with the 13th charge, contributing 12 *2k e²=24k e².

The number of mutual pairs among the 12 charges is C(12,2)=66. If each mutual pair contributes (4k e²)/r_ij, but without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that each r_ij is 2 meters, making each U_ij=2k e². So mutual U=66*2k e²=132k e².

Thus, total U=24k e² +132k e²=156k e²=156*8.988e9 *2.566e-38= 3.600e-26 J.

But this is option A (5.645e-26) is higher than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 156k e² using precise values.

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=23.07e-29=2.307e-28.

156 *2.307e-28=360e-28=3.60e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since my initial calculation (excluding mutual interactions) gives about 5.54e-27 J, which is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem expects me to include the mutual interactions, but I can't compute them without more information.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energies sum to zero, but that's only possible if some are positive and some are negative, which they aren't. So that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make a choice here. Based on the calculations, the correct approach includes only the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed one, leading to approximately 5.54e-27 J. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.27 times higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula. Wait, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) * sum U_ij, but I think that's already accounted for in the way I calculated the mutual interactions.

Wait, no. The total potential energy for a system of charges is the sum over all pairs, each counted once. So, for the 12 charges, it's C(12,2)=66 pairs, each contributing U_ij.

But without knowing the individual r_ij, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that each r_ij is 2 meters, which would make each U_ij=2k e², leading to mutual U=66*2k e²=132k e². Adding the 24k e² from the fixed charge interactions, total U=156k e²=3.6e-26 J, which is option A's magnitude but not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the interactions between the fixed charge and the others, leading to 5.54e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute using e=1.602e-19 C, but in the calculation, I used (2e)^2=4e². Let me check:

(2e)^2 =4e², correct.

So, 4e²=4*(1.602e-19)^2=4*2.566e-38=1.026e-37 C².

Then, (k *4e²)/2 = (8.988e9 *1.026e-37)/2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.026e-37 = 8.988 *1.026=9.229e-28.

Divide by 2:4.6145e-28 J per charge.

Multiply by 12:5.537e-27 J.

Yes, correct.

So, I think the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not certain why it's higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from each other, not from P. But that's not what the problem states. The problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so their distance from P is fixed, but their mutual distances can vary.

Since I can't resolve this, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is approximately 5.54e-27 J, which isn't an option. But perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct calculation leads to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the Coulomb's constant as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9, leading to a slightly higher value.

Let me re-calculate using k=9e9.

U =24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

24 *9e9=216e9.

216e9 *2.566e-38 =216 *2.566e-29=554. 256e-29=5.54256e-27 J.

Still close to 5.54e-27 J.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is placed at 2 meters from P, but the 13th charge is at a different location. No, the 13th is fixed at P.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but I'll proceed to choose the closest option, which is option C.


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to remain at a distance of 2 meters from a fixed point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is determined by considering the interactions between the charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Interactions with the Fixed Charge**:  
   The 13th charge at \( P \) interacts with each of the 12 charges at 2 meters. The potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges is given by:  
   \[
   U_i = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such charges, the total potential energy from these interactions is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

2. **Mutual Interactions Between the 12 Charges**:  
   The 12 charges are constrained to remain at 2 meters from \( P \), but their mutual distances can vary. The potential energy between each pair of charges is:  
   \[
   U_{ij} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{r_{ij}}
   \]  
   where \( r_{ij} \) is the distance between the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th charges. The total number of pairs among the 12 charges is \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \). Without specific information about the arrangement of the charges, the exact sum of \( U_{ij} \) cannot be determined. However, the problem likely assumes that the mutual distances are maximized to minimize the total potential energy.

3. **Total Potential Energy**:  
   The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the energy due to the fixed charge and the mutual interactions:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed}} + U_{\text{mutual}}
   \]  
   If the mutual interactions are neglected (as their exact contribution cannot be calculated without additional information), the total energy is approximately:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} \approx U_{\text{fixed}} = 24k e^2
   \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:  
   Using \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \):  
   \[
   e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
   \]  
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed}} = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   This value does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly higher than the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable choice, based on the calculations and the provided options, is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

Answer: C
