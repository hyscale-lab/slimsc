Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and it's in a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in two dimensions, potential problems often involve polar coordinates because of the r and θ dependence. The potential here looks like a combination of a harmonic oscillator term and another term that depends on cos squared theta.

Wait, so let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr². That looks a lot like the potential for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator because the potential for a 2D harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² (x² + y²) which in polar coordinates becomes (1/2) m ω² r². But wait, in our case, the potential is (1/2)kr². So that would be similar if kr² is like (1/2)mω² r². So maybe ω is sqrt(k/m), because k = m ω², so ω = sqrt(k/m).

The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Because cos²θ can be written using a double angle formula. I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the
