Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. Alright, the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and they have negligible mass. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energies, I should consider the electrostatic potential energy between them. Since the system is isolated, I guess I don't have to worry about external fields or anything. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². So each pair contributes this amount.

But wait, in this case, we have multiple charges. So I need to calculate all the pairwise interactions. Let me think about how many pairs there are.

So, there are 13 charges total. 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, and one is fixed at P. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so all the 12 charges are at 2m away from it. So the first thing I should calculate is the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges. Then, I also need to consider the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves because they repel each other.

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P. Are they all at the same distance from each other? Hmm, no, because they're all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. Oh wait, if they are arranged in a sphere around P, then each is 2m from P. But their distances from each other would vary. For example, two charges would be 2m from P, but the distance between them would be 4m if they are diametrically opposite on the sphere. But that's not the case if they are all on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify how the 12 charges are arranged. Hmm, if it's the case where all the 12 are placed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified, maybe we can assume that they are all at the same point? No, that can't be right because that would cause infinite potential energy due to overlapping charges. So, perhaps the problem is considering all the charges except the fixed one as being at a fixed distance from P, but their mutual distances are negligible, or maybe they're all at the same point, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying things by assuming that the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P, but their distances from each other are such that each pair is at a certain mutual distance, but without knowing the exact arrangement, I might have to make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge at P, and not considering the energy between the 12 charges themselves. But that doesn't make sense because the system's total energy would include all interactions.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So maybe arranging the charges in a way that minimizes the potential energy. For like charges (all positive, since each is 2e), the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so their positions are fixed relative to P, but their mutual distances can vary.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps we can arrange them in a way that each is as far as possible from the others. For example, placing them on the surface of a sphere with radius 2
