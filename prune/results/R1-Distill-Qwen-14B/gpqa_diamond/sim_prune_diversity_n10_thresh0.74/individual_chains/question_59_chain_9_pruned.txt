Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider the neutralization reactions. Here, we're mixing a weak acid (acetic acid), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (barium hydroxide). So, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will probably neutralize each other first, and then see if there's any excess acid left or if some base remains.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a hydroxide of an alkali earth metal (Ba is in group 2). HCl is a strong acid, so they should completely dissociate. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely.

So, let's calculate the moles of each reactive component because that's the key in neutralization.

Calculating moles:

For CH3COOH: Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

For HCl: Volume is 400 mL → 0.4 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+ ions. So, 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2: Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So, moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but wait. When HCl (H+ source) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (OH- source), the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the H+ from HCl will neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But how much H+ and OH- do we have?

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles.

So, when they react, the H+ will be consumed first. Let's see, H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So, H+ will be all consumed, and some OH- will remain.

Wait, no. Wait, the OH-
