Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, okay, let me read through the problem again.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters have specific IR absorptions, usually a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me there's an ester group in the molecule.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's parse that. Two signals are for aromatic protons. Six-membered aromatic rings with substitution can have different splitting patterns. Since it's di-substituted, the positions of the substituents will determine how the protons split. For example, para, meta, or ortho substitution. But the exact splitting might not be crucial here; maybe just knowing there are two types of aromatic protons.

Next, two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. The description says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, that's interesting. A doublet of quartets might mean that one vinyl proton is coupling with another set of protons. Maybe it's in a conjugated system or part of a substituent like an ester group?

Then, two signals for –CH3 groups. No signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups, but no methylene (CH2) groups. That probably means the substituents on the benzene ring are either methyl groups or perhaps something else that doesn't have CH2.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted. So two substituents on the benzene ring. Let me think about possible structures. Since there's an ester group, one substituent is likely an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other could be a methyl group or something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So perhaps each substituent has a methyl group. Or maybe one substituent has two methyl groups? Hmm, but the substituents are on the benzene ring, so maybe each substituent is a methyl ester or something else. Wait, no, an ester group would be something like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So if the ester is part of a substituent on the benzene ring, perhaps as a methoxycarbonyl group or similar.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group and a methyl group attached. So two substituents: one is an ester (like COOCH2CH3 or something) and the other is a methyl group. But wait, the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So maybe each substituent has a methyl group. So if one substituent is a methyl group attached directly (like
