Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is measured to be θ = 1e-17 degrees. The distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, all around 1e59 to 1e66 J/K.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But maybe I can simplify it because the constants might not matter for the order of magnitude.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, then compute the area, then plug into the entropy formula.

The event horizon radius R is given by the Schwarzschild radius formula: R = 2 G M / c^2. But perhaps I can find R using the angular size and distance. Since θ is the angular size, which is approximately the size of the object (R) divided by the distance d, right? So θ ≈ R/d. But wait, that's only when the object is much smaller than the distance, which it is here.

So R ≈ θ * d. But θ is in degrees, I need to convert that to radians because the formula probably uses radians. Oh, right, because 1 radian is 180/pi degrees.

So θ in radians is θ_rad = (1e-17 degrees) * (pi/180) radians/degree. Let me compute that. So 1e-17 * pi / 180 is approximately 1.74e-19 radians.

Now, d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I need to convert parsecs to meters because the standard units would be in meters for R. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 3.0857e16 * 1e10 = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R ≈ θ_rad * d = (1.74e-19) * (3.0857e26) meters. Let me calculate that: 1.74e-19 * 3.0857e26 = 1.74 * 3.0857 ~ 5.36, and the exponents: 1e( (-19) + 26 )=1e7. So 5.36e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.36e7 meters.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius R = 2 G M / c²
