Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm. I remember that a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator that uses a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. In a regular cyclotron, the particles move in a circular path, and the frequency of the applied voltage is synchronized with the rotation of the particles. But a synchrocyclotron is a bit different, right? Oh wait, I think the synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron used for accelerating particles to higher energies, and it's designed so that the frequency of the applied voltage changes as the particles gain energy.

Wait, so in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed because the cyclotron frequency depends on the mass and charge, which don't change. But in a synchrocyclotron, the particles accelerate and their mass increases (relativistically), so the frequency needs to adjust to keep the electric field in phase with the particle's motion. That makes sense.

So the key here is probably to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of revolutions it makes, considering the varying frequency. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationships. Let me think.

First, the kinetic energy of a proton is given by T = (gamma - 1) m_p c². Since the initial kinetic energy is negligible, the proton starts at rest (non-relativistically, but for high energies, we have to consider relativity).

Given that the final kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Let me compute the gamma factor. I know that the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So T = gamma m_p c² - m_p c² = (gamma -1) m_p c². So here, 950 MeV = (
