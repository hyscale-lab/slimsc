Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional system, so that should simplify things. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max. And the options are given, I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, so in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero and the kinetic energy is maximum. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't just use the classical formulas. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become important.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator can be found by equating the maximum kinetic energy to the maximum potential energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic case, so option C is probably not the answer here.

But wait, let me think again. In relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. The total energy includes rest mass energy, and the kinetic energy is the total minus the rest mass. So the energy equations become more complicated.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, when the mass is at amplitude A, all its energy is potential. But when it reaches the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. Wait, no, the oscillator's total energy would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is the rest mass energy plus potential energy: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait a second. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², but in the relativistic case, the potential is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point is different because of relativity.

So when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. The kinetic energy in relativity is given by (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy E is mc² (rest) plus (gamma - 1)mc² (kinetic) at that point. But wait, that can't be right because when x=0, the potential is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. When the oscillator is at x=A, all the energy is potential. So the total energy at that point is the rest energy plus the potential energy. Then, when it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So equate the two expressions for E.

So, E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Because when x=A, potential is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero (assuming it's at maximum displacement, so velocity is zero there). But wait, in reality, in a harmonic oscillator, the maximum velocity is achieved as it passes through x=0. So at x=0, the potential is zero, all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is treated the same way. Because in relativity, the potential might be a bit different, but the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So the potential energy would still be (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So at x=A, the potential is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy mc², but wait, no. Wait, in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, I think the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe I should think about it as the total energy E being equal to the sum of rest energy and the potential energy when x=A.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the oscillator is at x=A, it's at maximum displacement, so velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero in the classical sense. But in relativity, the total energy is always mc² (rest) plus kinetic energy. Wait, but if the particle is at maximum displacement, its speed is zero. So the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, but if speed is zero, gamma is 1, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at x=A is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

And when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc², because the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², and the total energy is gamma mc². So equate the two expressions for E.

So,

E = mc² + (1/2)kA² = gamma mc²

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c² )

Wait, because (1/2)kA² is the potential energy at x=A, so when x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But gamma is E/(mc²) when there's no potential. Hmm, but wait, in this case, when x=0, E is all kinetic, so E = gamma mc². So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So gamma equals 1 plus (k A squared) over (2 m c squared).

Then, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Wait, or maybe I should write gamma as 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But actually, gamma is E/(mc²), and E is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². So yes, that's correct.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but let me check the units. (k A squared) would be in units of force times distance, which is energy. So (k A^2) has units of energy. Divided by (2 m c²), which has units of energy. So the term is dimensionless, which makes sense because gamma is unitless.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But let me denote the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable to simplify. Let me call it s, so s = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, gamma = 1 + s.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + s.

So, square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + s)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + s)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + s)^2 ]

Hmm, let me compute that.

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + s)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + s)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + s)^2 )

Expand (1 + s)^2 = 1 + 2s + s^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (1 + 2s + s^2 -1 ) / (1 + s)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (2 s + s^2) / (1 + s)^2 ]

Factor numerator:

s (2 + s ) / (1 + s )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s )^2.

Now, substituting s = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = s.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify.

Let me denote s = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v^2 = c^2 [ s (2 + s) ] / (1 + s)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( s (2 + s) ) / (1 + s )

Hmm.

But looking at the options, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about gamma again.

Wait, another approach: in the non-relativistic case, when s is small (so k A^2 << 2 m c^2 ), then gamma would be approximately 1 + s, but that's when s is small. So the non-relativistic maximum speed is sqrt( k A² / m ), which is option C. But the correct relativistic expression is more complicated.

Wait, but let's see what the options look like.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, let me compute that denominator.

Wait, let's see:

Option B: 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )).

Hmm, but in my calculation, gamma is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is 1 + s, where s is small. So gamma = 1 + s.

Another approach: perhaps using the expression for gamma and then finding v.

Wait, let me think. Gamma is 1 + s, so 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + s.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + s).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c^2 = 1/(1+s)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1+s)^2 = [ (1+s)^2 - 1 ] / (1+s)^2.

Which expands to (1 + 2s + s² -1 ) / (1 + s)^2 = (2s + s²) / (1 + s)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2s + s²) ) / (1 + s )

Simplify numerator inside sqrt: s (2 + s) / (1 + s)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps there's a better way to express this.

Wait, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Wait, let me write v = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

But I'm not immediately seeing a simplification that matches any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ) )

Hmm, that denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m) )

But in our case, s = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So 1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ) would be 1 - (s c² )/(2m c² ) ?

Wait, no, because s = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So (k A^2)/(2m) ) = (s c² )/(1 )

Wait, perhaps that's not the way. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be expressed as v = c * sqrt(1 + (something) ) ?

Wait, the options involve sqrt(1 + ... ), so perhaps I can manipulate the expression for v^2.

Wait, let me think: v^2 = c^2 * [ s(2 + s) ) ] / (1 + s)^2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy E is equal to (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2. Wait, no, because when x = A, the kinetic energy is zero, so E is just potential plus rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2 when x = A, and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2? No, that doesn't make sense because in classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy is just (1/2)k A^2, which is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy. Because when the mass is at maximum displacement, its speed is zero, so kinetic energy is zero (relativistically, since v=0, gamma=1, so kinetic energy is zero). So E = mc² + (1/2)k A^2.

At the equilibrium position, x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc², because potential energy is zero.

So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A^2.

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which brings me back to the same expression as before.

So, gamma = 1 + s, where s = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Now, solving for v.

We have gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + s.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + s )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + s )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + s )^2.

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + s )^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + s)^2 - 1 )/( (1 + s)^2 ) ]

= c² [ (1 + 2 s + s² - 1 )/(1 + s)^2 ]

= c² [ (2 s + s² )/(1 + s )^2 ]

Factor numerator:

= c² [ s (2 + s ) ]/( (1 + s )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( s (2 + s ) )/(1 + s )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this expression. Let me see what the options look like.

Option A: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2m)) )

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )

Option C: non-relativistic, so not the answer.

Option D: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm. None of these immediately match, but maybe I can manipulate my expression further.

Wait, let me compute what s is again. s = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

s + 1 = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, the denominator in the expression I derived for v is (1 + s ), which is same as 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

The numerator is sqrt( s (2 + s ) )

Hmm, s (2 + s ) = 2 s + s².

Which is 2 (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) + (k A²/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

= (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor s(2 + s) as s(s + 2) = s (s + 2) = s^2 + 2s.

Wait, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

v = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

Hmm, maybe I can factor it differently. Let me write it as:

v = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

= c * sqrt( s (s + 2) / (s + 1)^2 )

= c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1)^2 )

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the denominator is (s + 1)^2, so when you take the square root, it's (s + 1 ), so the expression becomes [ s(s + 2) ]^(1/2) / (s + 1 )

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

sqrt( s(s+2) ) = sqrt( (s^2 + 2s ) )

= sqrt( (s^2 + 2s + 1 ) - 1 )

= sqrt( (s + 1 )^2 - 1 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (s+1)^2 - 1 ) / (s + 1 )

= c * sqrt( (s+1)^2 - 1 ) / (s+1 )

Hmm, that's an interesting approach. Let me compute that:

sqrt( (s+1)^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( s^2 + 2s + 1 - 1 ) = sqrt( s^2 + 2s ) = sqrt( s(s+2) ), which brings me back.

Hmm, not helpful. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B: v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, let me compute the term inside the square root.

Denominator is (1 - (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )) = 1 - s/(c^2 )? Wait, no, because s is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = 1 - s.

So, the term is 1/(1 - s ), so inside the square root becomes 1 + 1/(1 - s )

= [ (1 - s ) + 1 ] / (1 - s ) 

= (2 - s )/(1 - s )

So,

v = c sqrt( (2 - s )/(1 - s ) )

Hmm. Does that match any of our expressions?

In our case, v = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

Hmm, but I don't see a direct match. Let me see if I can manipulate this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kA². Because in relativity, the potential could have a different form. But the problem states that it obeys Hooke's law, so F = -k x. So the potential V(x) is (1/2)k x².

So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, let me think again about the problem. Another approach: The oscillator's total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and potential energy at maximum displacement.

E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

When the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc².

So,

gamma = (mc² + (1/2)kA² ) / (mc² )

= 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

So, gamma = 1 + s, where s = (k A² )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

gamma = 1 + s.

Hmm, perhaps I can express (gamma) in terms of v.

But I'm not seeing a way to match this to any of the options directly.

Wait, let me compute each option:

Option A: v = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m )) )

Let me compute the term inside:

1 - (k A^2)/(2m ) = denominator.

So, 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m )) = [ 2m ]/( 2m - k A^2 )

So, 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2m )) = 1 + [ 2m/(2m - k A^2 ) ]

= (2m - k A^2 + 2m )/(2m - k A^2 )

= (4m - k A^2 )/(2m - k A^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Denominator inside is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) = 1 - s.

So, 1/(1 - s ) = 1/(1 - s )

So, 1 + 1/(1 - s ) = (1 - s + 1 )/(1 - s ) = (2 - s )/(1 - s )

So, v = c sqrt( (2 - s)/(1 - s ) )

Hmm, but in our expression, v = c sqrt( s (s + 2 ) ) / (s + 1 )

Hmm.

Wait, let me compute (2 - s)/(1 - s ) and see if it's the same as [ s (s+2 ) ]/(s + 1 )^2.

No, but perhaps I can find a relationship.

Wait, let me compute (2 - s)/(1 - s )= [ (2 - s ) ] / [ (1 - s ) ]

= [2 - s ] / [ 1 - s ]

= [ (1 + (1 - s )) ] / (1 - s )

= (1/(1 - s )) + ( (1 - s ) )/(1 - s )

= 1/(1 - s ) + 1

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression for v^2 in terms of (2 - s )/(1 - s )

v^2 would be c^2 * (2 - s )/(1 - s )

But in our case, v^2 = c² [ s (s + 2 ) ] / (s + 1 )^2.

So,

c² (2 - s )/(1 - s ) compared to c² s (s+2 )/(s+1 )².

Hmm, let's see.

Let me compute (2 - s ) (s + 1 )² and s(s + 2 ) (1 - s ).

If they're the same, then the expressions would be the same.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute for s = 0. Then,

(2 - 0 )/(1 - 0 ) = 2.

s (s + 2 )/(s+1 )^2 = 0.

So, for s=0, option B's expression gives 2, which would be v = c sqrt(2 ), but my expression gives zero. But that's not correct because, when s=0, the speed should be the non-relativistic maximum speed, which is sqrt( k A^2 / m ) = sqrt( (2 m c^2 s ) / m ) = sqrt(2 m c^2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )= sqrt(k A^2 / m ), which is correct. So when s=0, option C is correct.

But for small s, option B would give v = c * sqrt( (2 - s )/(1 - s ) ) ≈ c * sqrt( (2)(1 + s/2 )/( 1 + s ) ) ). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier derivation. Let me double-check.

When x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the oscillator's speed is zero. So the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

When the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E = gamma mc².

Thus, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Yes, that's correct.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) = 1 + s, where s = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

We can write this as:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(gamma)^2 = 1/(1 + s )^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + s )^2.

= [ (1 + s )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + s )^2

= [ 1 + 2s + s² - 1 ] / (1 + s )^2

= (2s + s² )/(1 + s )^2.

= s (2 + s )/(1 + s )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( s (2 + s ) )/(1 + s )

Hmm.

I can factor this as:

v = c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

= c * sqrt( s (s + 2) ) / (s + 1 )

Hmm, not matching any option yet.

Wait, let me compute what option D looks like.

Option D: v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Hmm, let me compute the term inside.

1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) = 1 + s.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + s )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( [ (1 + s )^2 - 1 ]/(1 + s )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2 s + s^2 )/(1 + s )^2 )

= c * sqrt( s (s + 2 )/(1 + s )^2 )

Which is the same as the expression I derived for v.

So, option D's expression is correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that none of the options matched, but now I see that option D is equivalent to my expression.

Wait, so:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is:

v = c sqrt( ( (1 + s )^2 - 1 )/(1 + s )^2 )

= c sqrt( (2 s + s^2 )/(1 + s )^2 )

Which is the same as my expression.

So, option D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D was not matching. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought none of the options matched. Because option D's expression, when simplified, matches the expression I derived. So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the options, option D is written as:

D) v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is exactly the expression I have. So option D is the correct choice.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system's energy. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). The potential energy is \( V = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), so the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Thus, the total energy at \( x = 0 \) is:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( s = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so \( \gamma = 1 + s \). Using the relativistic relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + s.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + s)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + s)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + s)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( s = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators or terms that do not match the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
