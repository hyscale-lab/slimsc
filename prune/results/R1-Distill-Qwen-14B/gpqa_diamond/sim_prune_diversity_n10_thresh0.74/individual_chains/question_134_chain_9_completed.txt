Okay, so I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of neutralization problem. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with a base. But wait, I need to think about how to approach this specific problem.

The question gives three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. So the first step is probably to figure out how much of each acid and base is present. 

Wait a second, HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So the reaction would be between these acids and the base. But wait, when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So I need to find out which is in excess.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

Starting with HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, it donates one H+ per molecule. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4: Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Its molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL is 0.2 L. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So OH- moles: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when an acid and base react, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio to form water. So the neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So let's see: total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 < 0.28, so OH- will be completely consumed, and some H+ will remain.

So the amount of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases enthalpy. I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is around -57 kJ/mol, but wait, wait. Wait, HCl and H2SO4's neutralization might have different values because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid.

Wait, wait, no. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acids. But wait, actually, for strong monoprotic acids like HCl, it's about -57 kJ/mol. For H2SO4, which is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second is weaker? No, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, both H+ ions are released in solution. But for the second H+, does it have a different enthalpy? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that the first H+ from H2SO4 is about the same as HCl, but the second might have a slightly higher or lower value. Or maybe when considering the neutralization, each H+ contributes to the enthalpy.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of acid. For strong acids like HCl, it's about -57 kJ per mole of acid (since each mole gives one mole of H+). But for H2SO4, each mole gives two moles of H+, so maybe the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 is about -114 kJ (since 2 * 57). But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe each H+ contributes about -57 kJ, so two would be -114, but some sources say that the second dissociation of H2SO4 is not as exothermic, so the enthalpy might be a bit different. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, it's assumed that each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ.

Alternatively, sometimes when you have a mixture of acids reacting with a base, each H+ contributes the same amount to the total enthalpy change.

Wait, but in this case, we have a mixture of two acids and a base. When they are mixed, all the OH- will react with H+ from both acids until one is used up.

So, the total H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So 0.2 moles of H+ will be neutralized, and 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

Wait, but the enthalpy released would be for the neutralization of 0.2 moles of H+.

So each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would contribute 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, units. Because the options are in kcal and kJ.

Wait, the problem says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization'—so we need to be careful about units. The options include both kcal and kJ. Maybe I should convert the units correctly.

Wait, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 1 kJ is about 239.006 calories. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: since 1 kcal = 4184 J, 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, that's per mole of H+.

Wait, wait: 57 kJ per mole H+ is equal to approximately 13.6 kcal per mole H+.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is negative, so -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is not twice that of HCl because the second H+ doesn't release as much. For example, when H2SO4 reacts with a base, the first H+ releases about -57 kJ/mol, and the second releases about -50 kJ/mol or something. Hmm, but in this problem, since the OH- is limited, maybe it's only the first H+ from H2SO4 that's involved. Or perhaps all the H+ from both acids are considered.

Wait, no. Because in the reaction, it's H+ reacting with OH-. So each H+ will contribute.

Wait, but if H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, then each mole gives two H+ ions. So when you have 0.09 moles of H2SO4, that's 0.18 moles of H+. But if the OH- is only 0.2 moles, then maybe all the H+ from both acids will react, but that can't be since the total H+ is 0.28, which is more than 0.2.

Wait, no, because 0.28 > 0.2. So the OH- will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So which H+ reacts first? Probably the strongest acids first. But in solution, HCl is a strong acid, fully dissociated, and H2SO4 is also a strong acid, so both H+ are available. So the neutralization will involve both H+ sources, regardless of which acid they come from.

So 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, each giving off about -57 kJ.

So total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, since it's exothermic, it's negative: -11.4 kJ. But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ which is not matching. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the unit conversion. Let me think again.

Wait, if each mole of H+ releases 57 kJ, then 0.2 moles would release 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't match. Or wait, perhaps the calculation isn't that straightforward.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is considered per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. So for HCl, each mole releases about -57 kJ. For H2SO4, since it's diprotic, each mole releases about -114 kJ. But then, when considering the reaction, we have to see how much of each acid is reacting.

Wait, but in this problem, it's the mixture of HCl and H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2. So the base is Ba(OH)2, which provides two OH- per formula unit. So 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So the neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O. The total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So if each H+ is 57 kJ, then 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, I need to make sure whether the problem is asking for the total enthalpy or per mole basis. The question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed.' So it's the total enthalpy change for the reaction.

Wait, but the options are in different units. Option B is in kcal, and D is in kJ. So I need to calculate it in either. Let me compute it in both.

If 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, each releasing 57 kJ:

Total enthalpy change = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that would match option D if it were -11.4, but option D is -16.0 kJ. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is approximated differently. Wait, maybe the value is about 57 kJ per mole for a monoprotic acid, but for diprotic, the second H+ is less exothermic. Assuming that the first H+ is about 57 kJ, and the second is about, say, 50 kJ.

Wait, but in this case, I'm only using 0.2 moles of H+ from the total 0.28 available. So how do I know which H+ ions are being neutralized?

Wait, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. HCl is monoprotic, so each H+ from HCl is 57 kJ. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each H+ is maybe 57 and then another value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that each mole of H+ contributes 57 kJ, regardless of the source. So 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ, which would be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm. So if the calculation is in kJ, the closest is option D, but it's -16.0, which is larger than 11.4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles to be sure.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Each gives one H+, so 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives two H+, so 0.18 moles.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives two OH-, so 0.2 moles.

So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have this. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is way off.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and that each mole contributes two equivalents of H+, but the enthalpy per mole of acid is different. Let me think.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 would be when one mole of H2SO4 is neutralized, which would require two moles of OH-.

Wait, but the problem is mixing all three solutions, so perhaps the way to approach it is to calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Wait, the equivalent method: for acids, equivalents = moles * valence. So HCl is 0.1 moles, each gives 1 equivalent → 0.1 eq.

H2SO4 is 0.09 moles, each gives 2 eq → 0.18 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.28 eq.

The base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles, each gives 2 eq → 0.2 eq.

So the base has 0.2 eq, and the acid has 0.28 eq. So the base is limiting, and 0.2 eq will be neutralized.

The enthalpy of neutralization per equivalent is about 57 kJ (since HCl is 57 per mole, and each mole is 1 eq). So 0.2 eq * 57 kJ/eq = 11.4 kJ. So again, same as before.

So the problem's options don't have this as a choice. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the answer in kcal instead of kJ. Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72 kcal. So -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that the neutralization per mole of H+ is 57 kJ or 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would be 2.72 kcal, so option A.

But why is there a discrepancy between the kJ and kcal options? Because the options are a mix.

Wait, the question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed.'

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, but considering the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the wrong approach. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the difference, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, in that case, let's see: H+ total 0.28, OH- 0.2. So net H+ is 0.08 remaining. Neutralization is 0.2 moles.

So the heat released would be 0.2 * 57000 J = 11,400 J → 11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the neutralization of the first H+ from H2SO4, and the HCl. Let me think.

HCl is 0.1 moles H+. H2SO4 is 0.18 H+, but perhaps only one H+ per H2SO4 is neutralized because the OH- is limited.

Wait, but in reality, all H+ are available regardless of the source. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react with H+.

So 0.2 H+ neutralized, so 0.2 * 57 kJ = -11.4 kJ. So that would be option D if it was -11.4, but it's -16.0.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of H+.

Wait, wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second is only partially. So perhaps in the presence of a strong base, the second H+ may not dissociate as much. But I think in the case of a neutralization reaction with a strong base, the second H+ would also dissociate because the base would pull it out.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe for the purpose of this problem, it's assumed that all H+ from the acids are available.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal. Let's convert 11.4 kJ to kcal. 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Hmm, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be 11.42 * 4184 J ≈ 47,500 J, which is 47.5 kJ. That doesn't align with the 0.2 moles.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the moles in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the equivalents correctly. Equivalents of acid are H+ available, equivalents of base are OH- available. So acid equivalents: 0.28, base: 0.2. So the neutralization is 0.2 equivalents.

Each equivalent releases 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ. So the answer would be closest to option D but it's not exactly matching. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the enthalpy per mole for HCl is -57 kJ, and for H2SO4 it's about -57 kJ per mole, but since it's diprotic, each mole contributes 2 H+, so the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 would be about -114 kJ.

But in this case, the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, so the enthalpy from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 114 = 10.26 kJ. HCl's 0.1 moles gives 0.1 *57=5.7 kJ. Total enthalpy from both acids is 15.96 kJ.

But the base is 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2, which can neutralize 0.2 moles H+ (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-). So the neutralization would involve 0.2 moles of H+, which would come from the HCl and H2SO4.

Wait, but the total H+ is 0.28. So 0.2 neutralized, 0.08 remains.

So the total heat released would be 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. So that's the same as before.

So why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But the option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about 47.5 kJ, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing moles of acid with moles of H+. Let me think again.

Wait, let me compute the total moles of H+ and OH-:

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH-.

So neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O. Moles of H+ neutralized: 0.2.

Each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ.

So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal per mole H+.

So 0.2 moles H+ → 0.2 *13.6 =2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option B present? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the neutralization as per mole of reaction, but it's not just the H+.

Wait, the neutralization of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 might have a different stoichiometry. For example, H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In that reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, releasing 2 moles of water. The enthalpy for this reaction would be higher because two H+ are neutralized.

But in our case, the H2SO4 is mixed with HCl, and both are reacting with Ba(OH)2. So the reaction includes both acids.

But perhaps this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the maximum possible neutralization, but I think the initial approach was correct.

So I'm back to thinking the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \)  
     Each HCl molecule contributes 1 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).

   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \)  
     Each H₂SO₄ molecule contributes 2 H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Molarity = 0.5 M, Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \)  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule contributes 2 OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will neutralize \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \) of H⁺.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ per mole of H⁺} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \( 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

5. **Convert units if necessary:**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 239.006 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 239.006 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Analyze options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value when converted to kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

The correct answer is **-2.72 kcal**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
