Okay, so I've got this question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital quantum number. Since m is small, l must be small too, maybe l=0,1,2 or something like that.

The problem is to compare two things: the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ=0.4861 micrometers. I remember that 0.4861 μm is about the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line, which corresponds to a transition between n=3 and n=2. So the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula.

Let me jot down the Rydberg formula. It's 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. Since λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm, converting to meters gives 4.861e-7 meters.

So plugging into the Rydberg formula: 1/(4.861e-7) ≈ 2.057e6 m^-1. Then, 2.057e6 = R*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)). Let's see, for the Balmer series, n1 is 2 and n2 is higher. Wait, wait, wait. The transition that gives H-alpha is from n=3→n=2. So n1=2, n2=3.

So 1/(4.861e-7 m) = R*(1/2² - 1/3²) = R*(1/4 -1/9) = R*(5/36). Let me compute R:

R is about 1.097e7 m^-1 per hydrogen. Wait, actually the Rydberg constant for hydrogen is about 1.097e7 m^-1, right? So plugging that in:

2.057e6 m^-1 = 1.097e7 * (5/36). Let's compute the right side: 1.097e7 /36 is approximately 3.04
