Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons. The process given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I remember that when high-energy photons interact with the CMB, they can produce electron-positron pairs if their energies are high enough.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. That makes sense because the CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and its photons have very low energy, around microwave frequencies. So each CMB photon has about that much energy.

Now, the gamma-rays are high-energy, so their energy is way higher than the CMB photons. For the annihilation process to occur, the gamma-ray must have enough energy to produce the rest mass of an electron-positron pair. Oh right, the rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But wait, that's each electron, so two of them would sum up to about 1.022 MeV. Wait, no, because in pair production, you need the energy to create both particles and their kinetic energy. So the combined energy of the two photons must be at least twice the electron rest mass.

But wait, in pair production, the reaction requires that the sum of the energies of the two photons is at least equal to twice the rest mass of the electron. So in this case, the gamma-ray (high-energy photon) and the CMB photon (low-energy photon) must sum up to at least 2*0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. That's about 1.022e6 eV.

But wait, the gamma-ray's energy is much higher than the CMB photon's. So I'm thinking that E_gamma ≈ E_threshold. But wait, in reality, because the CMB photon isn't zero, the threshold is a bit lower. Let me think: the condition for pair production is that the sum of the energies in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, in the lab frame where the CMB photon is low energy, the condition is E_gamma * E_cmb >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 4. Wait, maybe that's the correct condition for two photon pair production.

Wait, correct formula: The condition for two photons to produce a pair is that their combined energy in the center of mass frame must be at least 2 m_e c^2. Using the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (in units where c=1, maybe). So s must be ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2.

But each photon's momentum is p = E/(c). So for photons, E = pc. So for two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (E1/c) + (E2/c) )^2 c^2. Simplifying:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no—because the photons are moving in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So the momentum vector sum would be p1 - p2 (if one is moving in +x, the other in -x). So the invariant s would be (E1 + E2)^2 - ( (p1 - p2) c )^2.

Wait, let me think in terms of 4-momentum. Each photon has 4-momentum (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). For photon 1, let's say it's moving in the +x direction, so p_x = E1/(c), and others zero. Photon 2 is moving in the -x direction, so p_x = -E2/(c), others zero.

So the total 4-momentum is (E1 + E2)/c, (E1 - E2)/c, 0, 0.

The square of the total 4-momentum is ( (E1 + E2)/c )^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 ) = [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] / c^2.

Expanding numerator: (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) ) = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2 / c^2.

For pair production, the invariant s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So:

4 E1 E2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2 )^2

Simplify: E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

So the product of the two photon energies must be at least the square of the electron rest mass energy.

In our case, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E_gamma. E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is about 1e-3 eV. So the condition is:

E_gamma * E_CMB ≥ (m_e c^2 )^2.

Wait, wait wait. Let me make sure. m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (m_e c^2)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2.

So E_gamma * (1e-3 eV) >= (0.511e6 eV)^2.

Solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Let me compute that. Let's compute numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11 (eV)^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e8 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61121e14 eV is 2.61121e5 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. 0.511e6 eV is 511,000 eV.

(511,000 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11 (eV^2).

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Convert to GeV: 2.61121e14 eV = 2.61121e14 / 1e9 = 2.61121e5 GeV.

So approximately 2.6e5 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer must be C.

But wait, the question is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So when the gamma-rays have energy above this threshold, they can annihilate with CMB photons, thus reducing their number over time. Therefore, their lifetime is limited by this interaction, so the energy E is when they meet the threshold. So gamma-rays with energy above this would have their lifetimes limited, so the threshold is the answer. So 2.6e5 GeV is option C.


To determine the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$ with CMB photons, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The invariant quantity $s$ for two photons is given by:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2,
\]

where $E_\gamma$ is the energy of the gamma-ray, $E_{\text{CMB}}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, and $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}$ is the rest mass energy of the electron. Rearranging for $E_\gamma$, we find:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
\]

The average energy of a CMB photon is given as $E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. Substituting $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}$, we calculate:

\[
E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Converting to GeV ($1 \, \text{GeV} = 10^9 \, \text{eV}$):

\[
E_\gamma \geq 2.61121 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.**
