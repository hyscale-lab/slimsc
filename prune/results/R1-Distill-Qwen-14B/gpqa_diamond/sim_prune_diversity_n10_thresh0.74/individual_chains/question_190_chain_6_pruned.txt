Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I need to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Let me think about what I remember regarding nucleophilic strength.

First, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent. Oh right, in polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity tends to follow the basicity order because the solvent doesn't stabilize the nucleophile as much. But in polar protic solvents like water or alcohol, the situation is different. In those, the nucleophilicity is inversely related to the size and polarizability of the nucleophile because the solvent can stabilize the more polarizable (and hence larger) ions better.

Wait, wait. So in aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable the nucleophile, the less reactive it is. Because polar aprotic solvents solvate the nucleophile less, making them stronger. But in polar protic, the solvation is strong, so the effective nucleophilicity is reduced.

So the nucleophiles given are:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (a cyclohexoxide ion)
2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)
3. Propionate ion (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate ion (HS⁻)

Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check the list again. Oh no, number 4 is Methanol, which is CH3
