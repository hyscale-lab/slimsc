Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship. Wait, parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when observed from two points on Earth's orbit. So the formula I think is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. Right, because distance d in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. Oh wait, no, wait—parallax p is equal to 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So p = 1/d => d = 1/p.

But the question gives N proportional to 1/p^5. So substituting d into that, N would be proportional to (d)^5, because if p is 1/d, then 1/p is d. So 1/p^5 is d^5, which is 1/(1/p)^5 = p^-5 = (1/d)^-5 = d^5. So N ~ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. Hmm. Wait, I think I need to consider the number of stars in a shell between distance r and r+dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell.

Wait, but let's think about it. The number of stars in a given volume depends on the density. If the number of stars per unit volume is n, then the number in a spherical shell of thickness dr would be n * 4π r² dr. But wait, in this case, the question says the number varies as 1/p^5, which I think relates to the number per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps I should rephrase. The number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p = 1/d, N = k / p^5 = k d^5, where k is a constant. So N is proportional to d^
