Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I remember that NMR can give a lot of information about the structure, especially the protons and their neighboring environments. Let me look at the data provided:

The 1H NMR has four signals:
1. 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets or something, maybe)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each signal.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the methyl group attached to an oxygen, like in an acetate. Acetate esters typically have a (OAc) group where the methyl is a singlet around 2.0-2.1 ppm. So that makes sense.

Now the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). That's likely a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because if it's next to a double bond, the protons would split into a doublet. Like maybe CH2-CH2, but wait, if it's a CH group, no. Wait, wait. Let me think: if it's a CH2 group next to a CH (which is part of a double bond), the CH2 would have neighboring protons. But in this case, it's a 3H group, which suggests a methyl (CH3). So perhaps a CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe something like CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or maybe a propenyl group.

Wait, the other signal is at 5.5 ppm. That's a region where vinyl protons (those attached to double bonds) usually appear. The 7.0 ppm is a higher upfield, but wait, no, 7 is actually downfield, more like aromatic protons. Oh wait, but the question is about propenyl or butenyl acetates. So maybe it's an allyl group.

Let me sketch possible structures for each option.

The options are:
A) Cis
