Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. I remember that in nuclear physics, the 1S0 state refers to the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the nucleon pair. 

The problem says that the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics impose some conditions on the quantum numbers of the final state. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the sum of these, when added together, must equal the isospin modulo 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out which partial wave is not allowed, given the options.

First, I should probably recall some basic concepts. The initial state is a 1S0 state. The notation 2S+1 L J, I think. So for 1S0: 2S+1 is 1, so S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, so L=0 (since it's S state). J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When the particle X is emitted, the total system (NN and X) must conserve angular momentum and parity. Also, Pauli exclusion affects the possible quantum numbers.

The equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0 for the final NN state, let's plug that in.

So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies that S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

Wait, S is the spin of the NN system, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the final state, S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.

But wait, the initial state has S=0, L=0. So the change must come from the emission of X. So the orbital angular momentum L in the final state for the NN system would be determined by the angular momentum carried away by X.

Wait, the problem says that the partial wave is denoted by the lowercase letter, which is the angular momentum state of X. So for option A, it's p (which is l=1), option B is s (l=0?), option C is f (l=3), and D is p (l=1). Wait, no, wait. Looking at the options:

Options are given as 1S0 -> something. For example, option A is 7D1 + p. So the final state is 7D1, and X is p.

Wait, no, actually, the notation in the options is like 3S1 + p, meaning the NN state is 3S1 and X is a spin-½ particle (p implies l=1, but also the spin? Or is it just the orbital part? Hmm, perhaps p refers to the orbital angular momentum of X. So X has orbital angular momentum l, denoted by the letter. Letters go s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

So in each option, after the arrow, the first part is the NN state, and the second is the particle X's orbital angular momentum (like p, s, etc.)

Wait, no, looking at the options:

Option A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

So the initial state is 1S0, the final NN state is 7D1 (so L=2 since D is l=2), and X is p (which is l=1). Similarly, option B is 3S1 which is L=0, and X is p (l=1). Option C is 3D3 → L=2, and X is f (
