Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity equations. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

So plugging into the formula, v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now the second part: total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So I need to compute the energy for each and add them.

Wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So for each, calculate gamma and multiply by their mass.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A: v =0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: v=0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy of B: 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, adding those together: 2.5 +3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². That's about 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options:

Option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is about 5, so less than what I calculated.

So the correct energy is approximately 5.96
