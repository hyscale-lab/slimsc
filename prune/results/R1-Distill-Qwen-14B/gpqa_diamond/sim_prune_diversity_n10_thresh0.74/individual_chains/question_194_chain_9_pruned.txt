Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-Î²E), right? Oh wait, no, the formula is Z = sum_{states} exp(-E/(kT)), and since beta is 1/(kT), it's exp(-beta E). But wait, in the formula given, E is negative J times the sum of the products. So I need to calculate each possible state's energy and sum up the exponentials.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so each has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll need to enumerate all 8 possible states, calculate E for each, then compute exp(-beta E) for each, and sum them all.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since all the spins are identical and the energy is symmetric in them, perhaps I can group the states by their energy values. That way, I don't have to calculate each individually but can find how many states have the same energy and sum accordingly.

Let's think about the energy expression: E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the spins are the same or opposite. So each product can contribute either +1 or -1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from what? Let's see. For three spins, let's consider the possible cases.

Case 1: All spins are the same. So all S1=S2=S3=+1 or all -1.

In this case, each product term S_i S_j is +1. So the sum is 3 * 1 = 3. Thus, E = -J * 3 = -3J.

Case 2: Two spins are the same, and the third is opposite. Let's say S1=S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait. Let me recount. For two same and one different: each pair would be same if both are same, and different otherwise. So how many same pairs are there?

Wait, if two are same and one is different, the number of same pairs is one. Because, for example, S1 and S2 are same (product +1), S1 and S3 are different (product -1), S2 and S3 are different (product -1). So sum is 1
