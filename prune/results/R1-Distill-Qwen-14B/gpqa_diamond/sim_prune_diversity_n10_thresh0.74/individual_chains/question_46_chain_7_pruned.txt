Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, first, let's break down what the question is asking. Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions, right? It's a transition metal catalyst, usually used for breaking and reforming double bonds. So when Grubbs is involved, it's probably a ring-closing metathesis or an olefin metathesis reaction.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But since it's a double bond, I'm not sure how that affects the reaction. Maybe it doesn't matter because the catalyst would treat both enantiomers similarly.

Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait: pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl branch on C3. So, correct structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait. Let me number correctly.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2
