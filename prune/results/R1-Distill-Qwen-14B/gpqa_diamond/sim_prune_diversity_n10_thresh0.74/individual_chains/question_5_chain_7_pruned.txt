Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operator components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are involved with eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues. But here, the operator is P, not S, but probably similar in structure since the components are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because for spin-1/2 particles, operators like Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So the components of P are given as:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, but P is a vector operator, so the operator along an arbitrary direction n (which lies in the x-z plane) would be P·n, right? Since n is in x-z plane, it means the direction can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Because any direction in the x-z plane would have y-component zero.

Wait, but for a unit vector n, we can represent it as (n_x, 0, n_z), because it's in x-z plane. So since it's arbitrary, but constrained to that plane, n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ) where θ is the angle from z-axis. Right.

So the operator P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the operator is the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So substituting n_x and n_z, let's say n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. Because when θ=0, we're along z, and θ=π/2, we're along x, etc. So:

P_n = sinθ * Px + cosθ * Pz.

Substituting the matrices:

Px is [[0, 1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.
Pz is [[1, 0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So let's compute P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix elements:

The (1,1) element: (ħ/2)(0*sinθ + 1*cosθ) = (ħ/2) cosθ
(1,2): (ħ/2)(1*sinθ + 0) = (ħ/2) sinθ
(2,1): same as (1,2) because the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]? Wait, no, let me compute each element.

Wait, let me clarify the matrix:

First row: [ sinθ *
