Okay, so I have this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It says that constitutional isomers have the same formula but different structures, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements (like in enantiomers or diastereomers).

The question has two parts: part A and part B. 

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.
Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism.

I need to figure both parts A and B to choose the correct option from A to D.

Let's start with part A.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, leading to different structural isomers. The most common example is keto-enol tautomerism. So, if a compound has such a possibility, it can show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, or is it the quinone structure? Quinones are usually cyclic with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, but that's actually two ketones on a benzene ring. Wait, no, maybe it's a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. Alternatively, benzoquinone could also be 1,4-benzoquinone, where the two ketones are at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, but cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So it's a tricyclic ketone.

Now, tautomerism. For a compound to show keto-enol tautomerism, it needs to have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group). Because in the enol form, the hydrogen moves from the alpha carbon to the oxygen.

So, looking at benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone): each ketone is on the benzene ring. The structure is O
