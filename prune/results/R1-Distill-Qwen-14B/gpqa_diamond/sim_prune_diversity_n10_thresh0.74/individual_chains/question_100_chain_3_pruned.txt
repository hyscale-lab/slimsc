Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions, and we need to identify which statement about the products is incorrect. Hmm.

First, let me list out the reactions as described:

1. Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination with CCl4 to form B.
2. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C.
3. C is passed through a red-hot iron tube to produce D.
4. D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E.
5. E, in the presence of iron scrap and HCl, forms F.
6. F reacts with nitrous acid to form G.
7. G reacts with NaOH to form H.

Each of these steps probably involves some common organic reactions. Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. That molecular formula could be either propene (propylene, CH2=CHCH3) or cyclopropane. But since the first step is bromination in CCl4, which is a solvent for bromination. Wait, bromination in CCl4 is a substitution reaction? Or maybe it's an addition? Let me think. Oh, wait, for alkenes, bromination in CCl4 is typically an addition reaction. So if A is an alkene, perhaps propene. So A is propene, CH2=CHCH3.

So step 1: Bromination of propene. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) would undergo bromination to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or does it add across the double bond? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when an alkene reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it's a diaddition. So propene would add Br2 across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. So B would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Is that right? Or wait, maybe it's a different product, maybe 1-bromopropane? No, no, addition would give vicinal dihalide. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Step 2: B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and heat would cause elimination. Since B is a vicinal dihalide, reacting with alcoholic KOH would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation. Wait, vicinal dihalides can eliminate twice. So let's think. When a
