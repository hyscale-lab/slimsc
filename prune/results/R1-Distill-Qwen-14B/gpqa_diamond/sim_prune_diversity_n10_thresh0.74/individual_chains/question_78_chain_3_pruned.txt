Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're observing the electromagnetic field at a point r. At some earlier time tr, the charge was at a position such that the vector from there to r is d. The velocity at that time tr is v.

I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But when using potentials, the scalar potential V and vector potential A come into play. The potentials are used to calculate the fields via Maxwell's equations.

Wait, for a stationary charge, the electric field is given by Coulomb's law, and there's no magnetic field. But when the charge is moving, especially at relativistic speeds, things get more complicated. However, in this case, maybe it's non-relativistic since they're giving expressions with c, but not using gamma factors. Hmm, not sure.

I think the potentials can be derived from the retarded time concept. The retarded time is when the effect of the charge's motion is felt at the observation point. So, for potentials, the scalar potential V(r,t) and vector potential A(r,t) both depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr.

The scalar potential V is usually (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge to the observation point at time tr. Wait, but in this problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - r', assuming r is the position of the observer. So |d| would be the distance between the charge and the observer at time tr.

Wait, no. Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is more complicated. Because when the charge is moving, the potentials aren't just static anymore. Oh right, the scalar potential is the same as the static case if we use the retarded time, but the vector potential comes into play due to the motion.

So the scalar potential V is given by (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/(r - vt)]... wait no, that's the Coulomb potential but considering the charge is moving. Alternatively, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/(r - (v t))], but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think about the Liénard potentials. The scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge are given by expressions involving the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀) * 1/(r'), where r' is the distance at time tr. The vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * something, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the standard expressions for the potentials of a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε₀) * [1/|r - (v t) + (a t²)/(2c²)| ] evaluated at the retarded time. Hmm, no, maybe I'm mixing up some terms here
