Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each reaction does and figure out the compounds involved.

The starting compound is A, which is C3H6. Hmm, that molecular formulaâ€”what's that? C3H6 could be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But given the next reaction is bromination, I think it's more likely propene because cyclopropane's bromination is different. Right, propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would undergo bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, when alkenes react with bromine, it's an addition reaction. So compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Or wait, maybe it's 1,2 or 1,1? No, propene is CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when it reacts with bromine (Br2 in CCl4), it adds across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. That's a dehydrohalogenation condition, so it'll eliminate HBr. Wait, but B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, you get an alkene. Which one? Since there are two adjacent Br atoms,
