Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I remember that the metric describes the geometry of the spacetime. Since it's a pseudosphere, which is a type of hyperbolic space, right? Or wait, no, pseudosphere is more like a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, but in the context of metrics, I think it's about the geometry of the space.

Wait, the question is talking about the area of the pseudosphere. So perhaps this metric represents the geometry of a pseudosphere. But I'm not entirely sure about the pseudosphere's properties. Let me think. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like a saddle shape. But in the context of a metric, the pseudosphere would have a metric that reflects that negative curvature.

Looking at the given metric, it's written in terms of x and y coordinates. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Oh wait, that looks similar to the metric for a sphere but with a different sign. For a sphere, the metric usually has a denominator like (R² - x² - y²)² or something, but here it's 4 minus x² minus y². Wait, 4 is 2 squared, so maybe the radius is 2? The question says r=2, so that makes sense
