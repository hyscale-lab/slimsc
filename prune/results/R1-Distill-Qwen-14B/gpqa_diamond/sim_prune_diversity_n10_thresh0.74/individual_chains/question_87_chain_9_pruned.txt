Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and IR spectroscopy. Let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the structure. A 6-membered aromatic ring with two substituents. So di-substituted benzene, maybe. The total carbons are 8. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, because 6 (from benzene) + substituents = 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? Wait, no, since it's di-substituted. Oh, wait, each substituent can have more carbons, but the total substituents add up to 2? Wait no, the total carbon count is 8, including the benzene. So benzene is 6, plus substituents bringing it to 8. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So perhaps each substituent is a single carbon, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other a hydrogen? Wait, but substituents on benzene are groups attached, like -X, -OR, -NH2, etc. But the IR says we have a carbonyl and a halogen.

So the substituents are likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl, Br). Because the IR shows both C=O and aromatic-halogen.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents. So the benzene ring has two groups attached: one is an -X (like Cl, Br, etc.) and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. Let's think about the possible structures.

So for the substituents, perhaps one is an aldehyde (CHO), which is a carbonyl. But wait, benzaldehyde is a mono-substituted, but in this case, it's di-substituted, so another group is attached. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a ketone group, like a -CO-R, but R might add more carbons. But let's think about the total carbons.

Benzene (6) + substituent 1 (maybe a carbonyl group, like a ketone, which would require at least 1 more carbon if it's an alkyl ketone. Wait, but substituents: the carbonyl group could be part of a substituent that's part of the structure.

Wait, wait, the total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. So the substituents must be two groups each contributing 1 carbon, or one substituent is two carbons and the other is none, which doesn't make sense because it's di-substituted.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen, but how many carbons do they contribute?

Wait, a carbonyl group as a substituent, like -COCl? No, because that would have more atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acyl group, but that might add more carbons.

Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to the ring. So substituent 1 is -CHO (carbonyl), which is one carbon. Substituent 2 is a halogen, like -Cl. So substituents contribute two substituents, but only one carbon in total (the aldehyde's CHO is one carbon). So benzene (6) + CHO (1) + Cl (0? Because Cl is an atom, not a carbon). Wait, but that would make total carbons 7, but the molecule has 8. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that contributes two carbons. For example, a ketone like -COCH3. So that substituent would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). Then the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. So benzene (6) + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That works.

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: one is a -COCH3 (acetophenone-like group) and the other is a halogen, say Cl. So the molecule would be something like para-chloroacetophenone or another substitution pattern.

Wait, but the NMR needs to reflect this structure. Let's think about the possible NMR signals.

In the case where we have a benzene ring with two substituents, such as -COCH3 and Cl. Let's say they are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be in a
