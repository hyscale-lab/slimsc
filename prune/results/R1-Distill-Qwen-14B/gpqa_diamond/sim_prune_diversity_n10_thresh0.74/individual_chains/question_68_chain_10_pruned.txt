Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it aligns with the field because of the torque. But wait, the problem says the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on in a different direction. Let me try to break this down.

The particle is a spin 1/2, so its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment would be aligned with this field, so the energy is minimized there.

Then the field is turned off. Wait, what does that mean for the system? Oh, when the magnetic field is off, the Hamiltonian for the interaction with the field goes away. So the system's state might change because the environment is altering. But then another magnetic field is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So now the magnetic field is along Y.

The question asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, when the field changes, the system's state could start precessing, leading to oscillations in expectation values like <Sz>.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the initial spin direction, it causes the spin to precess around the field's axis. This is similar to the way a spinning top wobbles around another axis when you tap it.

In the initial state, the spin is along +Z because the magnetic field was along
