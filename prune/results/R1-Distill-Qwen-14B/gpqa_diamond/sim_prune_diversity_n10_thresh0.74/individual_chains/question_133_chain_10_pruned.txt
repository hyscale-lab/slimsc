Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphate compounds. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

So, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The substances are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, each at 1.00 grams. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

Wait, I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or maybe it's a matter of solving the equilibrium between H3PO4 and its salts.

H3PO4 has three dissociation steps with given Ka values: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the relevant equilibria are:

H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+ (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ (Ka3)

But how do these relate to the salts given?

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K+ HPO4^2-? Wait no, wait. Let me think. No, wait, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, H2PO4^- comes from H3PO4 losing one H+. So, if I have KH2PO4, it's K+ and H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But I need to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but in solution, phosphate can exist in various forms. Since orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form, it's the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

So, perhaps the solution is a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? Or maybe between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?

Wait, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2), which is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So, that's the third dissociation. So, to get PO4^3-, it comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton.

So, we have HPO4^2- acting as a base, but in solution, it can also dissociate further. But in this solution, since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, maybe they form a buffer around the second and third dissociation steps?

Wait, but the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- which comes from HPO4^2- losing another H+. So, perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- considering the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

But wait, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, perhaps the HPO4^2- can both accept a proton (to form H2PO4^-) and lose a proton (to form PO4^3-). So, the main species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- in solution.

But the question is about PO4^3-, which is the concentration of the fully deprotonated form. So, how much of that is present?

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration from each salt and then see how they affect the orthophosphate concentration.

Wait, maybe the first step is to compute the moles of each phosphate species present.

Let me calculate that. The solution has 200 cm³ (0.2 L).

Molar masses:

- KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol. So, moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol. So, approximately 0.007345 moles of H2PO4
