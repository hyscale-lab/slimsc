Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the decay of X⁰ is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, with various lengths given.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience is their proper lifetime τ₀. But from the lab frame, the lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation comes from special relativity. The Lorentz factor γ is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So γ = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle, and m is its rest mass.

So first, I need to calculate γ. E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87, and 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. Oh wait, 27 is a bit less than 3.41 * 8. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. Let's say approximately 7.91.

Next, the observed lifetime in the lab frame is γ times τ₀. So τ = γ * τ₀. Plugging in the numbers, τ ≈ 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 * 8 is about 63.28, so τ ≈ 63.28e-16 seconds, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, right, I remember that in particle physics, the number of decays observed depends on the acceptance of the detector. The minimum resolution (I think this refers to the detector's timing resolution) would relate to how well the detector can measure the decay time.

The formula I recall is the efficiency η, which is the fraction of decays observed. The efficiency is given by η = 1 - exp(-t_min / τ), where t_min is the minimum time resolution. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the efficiency depends on the ratio t_lab / τ. Because the particles are moving, the time they have to decay depends on their speed and the length they travel. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the minimum resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of decays is probably about the time resolution. But maybe it's better to think in terms of the length they travel. Because in the bubble chamber, the particles leave tracks, and the length of the
