Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. I remember that TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, which is a method used to detect planets by observing the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But wait, that's more about detection, not the properties of the planets themselves.

The question tells me there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance, with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh right, orbital resonance has to do with the ratio of their orbital periods being simple fractions, which can lead to stable orbits. But for this problem, I think the key is the ratio of their periods and how that affects their equilibrium temperatures.

All the planets have the same albedo, which is the measure of how much light they reflect. Since albedo is the same, it won't affect the temperature ratio. So I can ignore that factor.

The question is asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering only the incoming energy from its star and its own outgoing thermal radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Wait, but since all these planets are orbiting the same star, T_star and R are the same for all, so the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.

But wait, the planets are in resonance, so their orbital periods are in specific ratios. The ratio given is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Let's list them:

Planet_1: period P1
Planet_2: P2 = 2 P1
Planet_3: P3 = 2.5 P1
Planet_4: P4 = 3.5 P1
Planet_5: P5 =5 P1

But wait, orbital periods relate to the semi-major axis through Kepler's third law. The law states that P² is proportional to a³, specifically P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ is proportional to P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, the semi-major axis for each planet will be a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant that depends on the star and other factors. Since we are looking for the ratio of the temperatures, the constants will cancel out.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is T4 / T2. Since T is proportional to (a)^(-1/2), because T = sqrt(R/(2a)) * T_star, and R and T_star are same, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2)   because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Let me double-check that. If T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), then T4 = T2 * (a2/a
