Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh wait, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, so first, what's an apothem of a polygon? I remember that the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, all apothems are the same. And in this case, the polygon is such that all apothems are length 'a', meaning it's a regular polygon with apothem 'a'.

But the problem says N is infinitely large. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So the aperture is effectively a circular one, with radius equal to the distance from the center to the vertices, not the apothem. Oh wait, wait. The apothem is a in this case. So for a regular polygon, the relation between the apothem (a) and the radius (R) is a = R * cos(π/N). But when N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but for N approaching infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So R ≈ a. So the radius of the circle is approximately 'a'.

So when N is infinite, the aperture is a circle with radius a. Then the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern's minima are given by certain conditions. Let me recall. The minima for a circular aperture occur where the Bessel functions have their zeros. The first minimum is at a certain angle. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with a single slit. For a single
