Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two reactions done by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. We need to find out how many peaks they observe in each.

Let me break it down.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that.

Hexan-3-one has a ketone at position 3. So, positions are 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5, 6. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group (OCH3). And the configuration is S.

When LAH reduces the ketone, the ketone group (C=O) becomes a CH-OH. So, the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait: LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it would reduce ketones. So, that would form a secondary alcohol.

Now, the starting material is a single enantiomer because it's (S)-configured. So the product after reduction should retain the configuration unless there's any inversion, but LAH typically doesn't change that because it's a ketone to alcohol without affecting the existing stereocenters (unless the hydroxyl is added to a new chiral center, but in hexan-3-one, the ketone is at position 3. So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons correctly. 1, 2, 3 (ketone), 4, 5 (OCH3), 6.

So, the ketone is at C3, so after reduction, it becomes a secondary alcohol at C3, so the structure is CH2CH2C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OCH3)CH3. Wait, wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, structure is:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3

Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, actually, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2C(O)(CH2)2CH3, but wait, let me count: carbon 1: CH3, 2: CH2, 3: C=O, 4: CH2, 5: CH2, 6: CH3. Wait, that's not right. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? So, the molecule is:

CH
