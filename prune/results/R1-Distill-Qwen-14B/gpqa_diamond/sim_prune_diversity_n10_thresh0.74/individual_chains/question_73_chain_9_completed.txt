Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use special relativity, right?

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I should probably tackle the relative speed between them. Wait, how do you calculate the relative speed in relativity? Oh right, because velocities don't just add up normally when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)) or something like that. Or is it the other way around? Since one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me write that out correctly. The formula for relative velocity u' when observing from one frame to another is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the observer relative to the first frame. Here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So if we're looking for the speed of A as seen from B's frame, it would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Which is about 0.143c, roughly 0.14c as one of the options. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of the rest masses times c². Each astronaut's total energy includes their kinetic energy as well. So the total energy E_total would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, I need to compute gamma and multiply by their respective masses.

Let's compute each one.

First astronaut (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c):
v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, moving at 0.5c):
v=0.5c → v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C's energy is 5.96 mc², and option D says 5 mc². So the energy must be about 5.96.

So putting it together, relative speed is about 0.14c, total energy about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
