Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutants. Hmm, let me think. The scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They're using EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a method that induces point mutations.

The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, the idea is that by mutating the gene, perhaps the compound isn't synthesized anymore. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, maybe a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein enough to disable it.

Looking at the options, the wild-type and four mutant sequences are given. I should compare each mutant to the wild type.

Wild Type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Each mutant has a different change in the first exon area.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type, the first few bases are ATGTTTCTC... whereas mutant 1 is ATGTTCTAC... Let me see where the change is. So after ATG (start codon), the wild is TTT, while mutant is TCT. Wait, let me count. Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... So the first part is ATG followed by TTTCTC. Mutant 1 has ATG followed by TCTAC, so the third codon is different.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at each position step by step.

Looking at the first part:

Wild:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT GTC G...
Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG CTG GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT GTC G...

Wait, maybe I should split each into codons.

Wild: Position 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CTC (Leu)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
22-24: GTG (Val)
25-27: GAT (Asp)
26-28: GAA (Glu)
Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me write each codon.

Actually, each codon is three nucleotides. Let me write them:

Wild type:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT GTC G...
So, codons:
1. ATG - Met
2. TTT - Phe
3. CTC - Leu
4. GCT - Ala
5. GGT - Gly
6. ACT - Thr
7. TCT - Ser
8. GTG - Val
9. GAT - Asp
10. GAA - Glu
11. CAA - Gln
12. TAT - Tyr
13. TTT - Phe
14. ATT - Ile
15. GTC - Val
16. G... (I think the sequence continues but perhaps the mutation is earlier.

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG CTG GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTT ATT GTC GC...

Codons:
1. ATG - Met
2. TCT - Ser (changed from Phe)
3. ACG - Thr (changed from Leu)
4. CTG - Leu (same as wild? Wait, wild codon 4 is GCT (Ala). Wait, perhaps I misaligned.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the exact differences. Let me write the first part of the wild and mutant 1:

Wild: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Mutant1: ...TCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Wait, so in the wild, after ATG, it's TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and in mutant 1, it's TCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, looking at the exact sequence:

Wild starts after ATG as TTT-CTC-GCT..., which is positions 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT.

Mutant 1 after ATG is TCT-ACG-..., so positions 4-6: TCT, 7-9: ACG, 10-12: GCT (same as wild, perhaps? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Wait, perhaps the change is that in mutant 1, the third codon is changed. Let me think about each option.

Wait, the goal is to find the mutation that disrupts the gene function, perhaps introducing a stop codon or a frameshift. Alternatively, a missense mutation that inactivates the enzyme.

But I don't see any stop codons in the sequences shown. So perhaps a frameshift mutation would affect the reading frame downstream, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutations:

Mutant 1: The sequence in the first exon starts with ATGTTCTACG... So the first codon is Met, then the second is Ser (TCT) instead of Phe (TTT), third is Thr (ACG) instead of Leu (CTC). Then after that, the rest of the codons are in frame. So it's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part is ATGTTCTAAGC... So after Met, it's TCT (Ser) then AAG (Lys) instead of CTC (Leu) and GCT (Ala). So again, point mutations. No frameshift.

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So the wild is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... and mutant3 is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACT...

So, the wild has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... which is Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr...

Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So looking at the codons: position 4-6 after ATG (codon 2) is TTT (Phe), then codon 3 would be TAC (Tyr). Wild codon 3 is CTC (Leu). So, in mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then the next codon would be GCT (Ala, same as wild?), but then the next part has a change.

Wait in the wild, after GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

So, codon 5 is GGT (Gly, same as wild), codon6 is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So two changes in codons 3 and 6.

No frameshift here either.

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Wild: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant4: ...ACGCTACT...

Wait, let me look more carefully.

Wild after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, breaking into codons:

Wild codons after ATG: TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), etc
