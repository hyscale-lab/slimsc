Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) each star would have after a one-hour exposure. The requirement is S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel.

Wait, the options are a to f, and the possible answers are A to D. I need to figure out which stars meet the detectability criteria. Let me think about how the S/N is calculated for a spectrograph.

I think the formula for S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and inversely proportional to the square root of the star's apparent magnitude. Oh, right, because the flux (which depends on the star's brightness) affects the S/N. Brighter stars (lower magnitude) will give higher S/N.

But wait, how does the apparent magnitude tie into this? Because the absolute magnitude is given, but I need the apparent magnitude, which depends on distance. Oh right, absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 pc. So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula.

The distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. So m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

So let's compute m for each star:

Star a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star, but I'm not sure of its magnitude. Let me check. Wait, from memory, Canopus has an apparent magnitude of about -0.7. So m is around -0.7.

Star b) Polaris. Polaris is also bright, but it's a variable. I think its apparent magnitude is around 1.7 to 2.0. Let me say approximately 2.0.

Star c) Absolute V mag 15, distance 10 pc. Since M=15 and d=10, m = 15 + 5*log10(10/10) -5? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is m = M + 5*log10(d) -5. So d=10, log10(10)=1. So m =15 +5*1
