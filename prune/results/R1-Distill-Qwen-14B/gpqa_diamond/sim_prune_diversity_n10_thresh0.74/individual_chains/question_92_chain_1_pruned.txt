Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like it's a diene with some branching. I think it's a substituted cyclohexene or something similar, but maybe it's just a straight-chain molecule with multiple double bonds or substituents.

The question provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, and some bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Right, bond energies are the amounts of energy required to break a bond. So, to calculate the enthalpy of formation, I think I need to use the bond energy method. 

The formula I remember is something like: enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed). But wait, actually, for enthalpy of formation from elements, you consider the energy required to form the molecule from its elements. So the approach is often to calculate the energy needed to break all bonds in the elements (like C and H) and then subtract the energy released when the bonds form in the molecule.

Wait, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ
