Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. And we need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, first, I need to remember what Grubbs catalyst does. Oh right, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. It's a type of catalyst that facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds.

So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at the first carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. The substituents are at the 3rd position.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and on
