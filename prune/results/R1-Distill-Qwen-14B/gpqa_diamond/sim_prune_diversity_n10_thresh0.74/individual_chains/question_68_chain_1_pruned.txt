Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. They ask about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. So, the particle starts in a state aligned with the initial magnetic field along Z. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian must change because the magnetic field direction affects the energy levels. I think the spin will precess around the new field direction, which is Y here.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. The magnetic moment mu is gamma times S_z, so the expectation value of mu_z would be gamma times the expectation value of S_z.

The spin precession would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate, but how?

In the case of spin in a magnetic field, the time evolution is determined by the Hamiltonian. The original field was along Z, so the initial state is the eigenstate of S_z, either up or down. Let's say it's up, because it's aligned.

When the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. So, the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S_y, specifically H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. Or wait, the sign might depend on the direction of the magnetic moment. Spin precession in a magnetic field, mu is opposite to the spin direction? Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B = -gamma S · B. Since B is along +Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, the energy levels for spin in a magnetic field are proportional to S·B. So the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z, but after the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of H, so it will evolve in time, causing oscillations in expectation values.

The time evolution is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, we can find the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ).

But since the problem is about the oscillation frequency
