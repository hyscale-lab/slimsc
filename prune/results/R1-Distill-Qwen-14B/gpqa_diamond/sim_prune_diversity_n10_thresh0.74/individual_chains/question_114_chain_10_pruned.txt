Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the options, I need to choose between A, B, C, or D, each providing different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think the first reaction is an addition reaction because butan-2-one (which is a ketone) is reacting with a nitrile source. I remember that the formation of a cyanohydrin occurs when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, and then something happens with protons.

Wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would have a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon, which is adjacent to the original carbonyl. That fits with the cyanohydrin formation.

So, the reaction mechanism for cyanohydrin formation typically involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the carbonyl carbon. Then, the proton transfer occurs, and the oxygen becomes hydroxyl. But to get this to happen, the solution might need to be acidic because I think the cyanide ion is a weak base and might not be reactive enough unless the solution is protonated. Alternatively, maybe the workup involves adding acid.

Wait, but the reagent for the first step is NaCN and A. Oh, NaCN is providing the cyanide ions, right? So what is A? It's the other reagent used in the reaction. Since the product is an addition product, I think the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Because the cyanide ion is a strong base, so in a more acidic environment, maybe it's more reactive.

Wait, but in the formation of cyanohydrin, the reaction is usually done with a strong acid like H2SO4 or H3O+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A might be H3O+ to provide the H+ ions needed for the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen. That would make sense.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think about the conditions for nitrile hydrolysis.

Hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions. For example, in acidic conditions, it's usually H2O with an acid catalyst. The reaction typically goes through an intermediate where the nitrile becomes an amide, then a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. Let me get that right. The reaction of a nitrile with water (usually under acidic or basic conditions) gives a carboxylic acid. In the case of the second reaction, the nitrile is in a molecule that already has a hydroxyl group in the same position. So when the nitrile group converts to a carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl group remains.

So reagent B is H2O, but perhaps with a catalyst.
