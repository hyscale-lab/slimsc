Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The setup is that these particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this has to do with the Lorentz factor affecting how far the particles travel before decaying. Because if they decay, they won't make it to the detector walls.

Wait, so the particles are fast-decaying, which I think means they have a short lifetime. So, their decay length must be a factor here. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The longer the decay length, the more likely the particle will reach the detector walls.

The problem says that at a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third reach the inner walls. So, I need to find the Lorentz factor that would result in two-thirds reaching the walls.

I remember that the decay length (L) is given by the product of the particle's proper lifetime (τ), the speed of light (c), and the Lorentz factor (γ). So the formula is L = γ * c * τ.

But wait, I also need to consider how much of the detector radius each particle can cover before decaying. So if the detector is 30 meters in radius, the particles need to travel at least 30 meters before decaying.

So, in the initial case, when γ is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. That implies that the decay length is such that only a fraction of them make it. Maybe it's related to the probability that the decay occurs beyond a certain point.

Wait, the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance L is given by P(L) = 1 - e^(-L/(γ c τ)). Because the probability that it hasn't decayed by distance L is e^(-L/(γ c τ)), right? So the probability that it does decay by L is 1 minus that.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The decay length L is the average distance, so the probability that the
