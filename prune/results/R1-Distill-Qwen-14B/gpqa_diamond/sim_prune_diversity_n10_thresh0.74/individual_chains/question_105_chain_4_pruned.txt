Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun. The star has some dark spots on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When we look at this star over time, the spots will cause brightness variations as the star rotates, which can look like an exoplanet passing in front of the star. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spots do.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness change (the dip in light) depends on the size of the blocking object relative to the star. For an exoplanet, the transit method measures the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front. The amplitude of this dip is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

Wait, but here, instead of a planet, we have spots. So, how does that work? When spots rotate into and out of view, the star's apparent brightness changes. Since the spots are cooler, when they're on the visible side, the star appears slightly dimmer.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so Rstar = R_sun.

The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. So, the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. But how does that translate into the observed brightness change?

I think the key is to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots. The formula for the change in flux when part of the star is covered by cooler regions is:

ΔF = (A_spot / A_total) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / T_star^4

Wait, or is that the way it works? Alternatively, the flux from the spotted area is less than the rest. So the total flux without any spots would be higher than with spots covering a part.

Wait, the star's total flux is F = σTeff^4 * (4π Rstar²) / (4π D²), but since we're dealing with relative changes, maybe we can ignore the distance D.

When a fraction of the star is covered by spots, the flux goes down. The fractional change in flux is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no: when the spots are on the side we see, the flux is F = F_uncovered + F_spotted. So, the flux with spots would be F = F_uncovered + F_spotted. F_uncovered is (1 - filling factor) times the star's flux per unit area, and F_spotted is filling factor times the spot's flux.

Wait, let's model this. The star has an effective temperature Teff, so each square meter emits σTeff^4. The spots have a temperature of
