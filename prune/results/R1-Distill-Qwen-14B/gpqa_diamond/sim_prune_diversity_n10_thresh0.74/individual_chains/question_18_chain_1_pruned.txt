Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the elemental abundances in two stars and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Let me read the problem carefully again.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The given elemental abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. 

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the notation. The [X/Y] notation usually represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. Right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2). Or wait, wait, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2. Let me think.

First, let me list the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 / (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 10^0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. Because [Fe/H] is the log of the ratio, so 0 means same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 / (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun = 10^0.3.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about how these relate. Let me think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1:
Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means Fe abundance relative to H is same as solar. So (n_Fe_1/n_H_1) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) = 10^(-7.5 -12) ? Wait, no, wait the given solar data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH_sun is 10^(-
