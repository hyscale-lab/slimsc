Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry and optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what each part is saying.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I should look for compounds with chiral carbons.

The options are four compounds labeled 1 to 4. And the choices are combinations of these. My task is to go through each compound and determine if they can exhibit optical isomerism.

Let's look at each one:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism, especially if there are substituents in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetric. The substituents here are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Let me visualize it. Biphenyl with substituents on the 6 and 2 positions. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky, but if the substituents are on opposite sides, could that lead to a chiral center? Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have some kind of stereoisomerism. Oh wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two phenyl rings are connected in a way that their substituents can be arranged differently around the axis. So if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't make the molecule symmetric, then it can have enantiomers. So in this case, the substituents are on 6 and 2 positions. Let me think: 6 and 6' are nitrated, and 2 and 2' are the ester groups? Wait, no: the formula is 6,6’-dinitro, so both have nitro groups. And 2,2’-dicarboxylate, so each has a carboxylate ester group. So the substituents on each biphenyl ring might be arranged in such a way that each ring has two substituents. But I'm not sure if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe each ring's substituents lead to axial chirality. If the two substituents on each ring are in positions that aren't symmetrical, like for 6 and 6', maybe that's causing axial chirality. So if the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a non-superimposable way, like the nitro groups are trans or something, then this compound would have enantiomers. So I think compound 1 can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be propanoic acid with an ester group. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be O

CH3-C-O-CO-OCH3

       OH

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH
