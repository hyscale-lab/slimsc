Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay channels of this boson X. The question gives me a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. Hmm, let's see what the Lagrangian looks like.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I need to parse this correctly. So, it's a term that couples X, which is a boson, to some fermions. The term looks a bit like a Yukawa interaction because it has the product of a fermion field and its adjoint, multiplied by some scalar field—in this case, X.

So the interaction term would be something proportional to X ψ ψ̄, which suggests that the boson X can mediate interactions between two fermions. That would mean X can decay into pairs of fermions, right? Because in a decay process, the boson would annihilate into two particles.

Now, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, to find out which fermion pairs it can decay into, I need to consider the conservation laws and the mass of the fermions. Remember, for a boson to decay into two fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson. Because energy and momentum must be conserved, and the rest mass energy of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the parent particle.

Wait, but wait—actually, in the decay X → f f̄, each fermion f has a mass m_f. So the combined rest mass is 2 m_f. The boson's mass has to be at least 2 m_f to allow that decay. So, 6 GeV must be >= 2 m_f. So m_f <= 3 GeV.

But wait, wait again. Wait, 6 GeV is the mass of X. So the maximum mass for each fermion would be 3 GeV. But wait, no, because the decay is into a pair, each fermion is m_f, so 2m_f <= 6 GeV → m_f <= 3 GeV.

But I should also remember that some fermions are heavier than others. Let me list the approximate masses of the known fermions.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). But top is way too heavy—173 GeV or something, so that's way above 3 GeV. So t quarks are out of the question.

Similarly, for leptons: electrons (e), muons (μ), taus (τ). Tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 2*1.77 is about 3.54 GeV. Wait, that's above 3 GeV. Wait, wait no—wait, X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f can be up to 6 GeV, so m_f can be up to 3 GeV.

Wait, 6 GeV is
