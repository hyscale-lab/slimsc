Okay, so I have this question about astronomy here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about Lyman alpha absorption by neutral hydrogen clouds and the redshift required for them to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific wavelength in the ultraviolet range for hydrogen. But wait, redshift comes into play when objects move away, so the wavelength stretches. So if the hydrogen is neutral and absorbing light at Lyman alpha, but we observe it at a longer wavelength because of redshift.

The problem states that the clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, no, actually, Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, right? So if the quasar emits light at that wavelength, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it, but due to redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer.

So the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for these clouds to be detectable. Lower limitâ€”so the smallest redshift where this is still possible. But how does that connect to detection with optical telescopes?

Optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, right? So if the absorbed wavelength is shifted into the visible range, then it can be detected. But if the redshift is too low, the wavelength might still be in the UV, which ground-based telescopes can't see because Earth's atmosphere blocks UV. So the Lyman alpha absorption must have been redshifted into the visible range.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. Visible light is about 400-700 nm. So the Lyman alpha wavelength needs to be redshifted beyond 400 nm so that it's in the visible range.

So we can model this. The redshift z is given by the formula (observed wavelength) = (rest wavelength) * (1 + z). So we set the observed wavelength to be just above the 400 nm threshold.

So, 400 nm is the lower end of visible light.
