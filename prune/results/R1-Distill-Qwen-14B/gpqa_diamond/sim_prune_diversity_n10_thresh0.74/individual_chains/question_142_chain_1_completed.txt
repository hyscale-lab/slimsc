Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I need to figure out its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my quantum computing class.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think that's a diagonal matrix because the off-diagonal terms are zero. Let me write it out to visualize better. 

So, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them would give a matrix like [[1,0],[0,1]], but then multiplied by 1/2, so it becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh right, that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Now, what's the geometrical position in qubit space? I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), where the point describes the state. But for a density matrix, we can think of it in terms of the Bloch vector, which is a vector that points to the state on the Bloch sphere.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). So, if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me compute that. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term:

|0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0, and |1><1| is the opposite, diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which is the identity matrix multiplied by 1. Then, when multiplied by 1/2, it's (1/2) I.

So, ρ = (I)/2. Now, according to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2 = ρ.

So, the vector r must be the zero vector, because otherwise, r·σ would contribute something. So r = (0, 0, 0). 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I should double-check. The Bloch sphere representation is such that the completely mixed state is at the origin. Oh right, because the completely mixed state is I/2, which corresponds to a completely depolarized state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So yeah, no components in any direction, so (0,0,0) is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \([0.5, 0.5]\) when written out explicitly. It corresponds to the completely mixed state of a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), which satisfies the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), it can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be the zero vector, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). The zero vector corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \((1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.  
**B) \((0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \(|1\rangle\), which is a pure state.  
**C) \((0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this is the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state.  
**D) \((1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid quantum state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
