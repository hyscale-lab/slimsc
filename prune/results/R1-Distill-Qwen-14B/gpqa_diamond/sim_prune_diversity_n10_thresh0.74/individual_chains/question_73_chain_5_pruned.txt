Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I think I should figure out the relative speed between the two astronauts. Since they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds divided by something, because in relativity, velocities don't add like that. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects as seen from the rest frame. But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so u is the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame or vice versa? Let me get this straight.

Actually, no. Wait, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second?

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is the one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. From A's frame, what is B's speed?

So using the formula: v' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c²), where u is the speed of the frame (A's speed in the rest frame, which is 0.6c), and v is the speed of B in the rest frame, 0.5c.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for transforming velocities is v' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c^2)).

So in this case, the rest frame is the lab frame. We want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So u here is 0.6c (A's speed), and v is 0.5c (B's speed). So plugging in: v' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator: (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c. So that's -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving at 0.1428c in the opposite direction relative to A. But since the question is about relative speed, it's the magnitude, so 0.1428c. That's about 0.14c, which matches option C and D's relative speeds.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has 0.14c and E=5.96 mc², and D has 0.14c and E=5 mc².

Next part: total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But wait, actually, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each astronaut.

Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c².

So for astronaut A, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Compute gamma for A: v=0.6c
