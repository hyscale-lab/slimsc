Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the particle has a magnetic moment mu which is gamma times Sz. So mu = γ Sz, right? The magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. So the magnetic field changes from being along Z to Y.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. Hmm. So I need to find the frequency with which <mu_z> oscillates.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around the field direction. In the case of a sudden change from B_z to B_y, the spin will start precessing around the new field direction.

But wait, initially, the particle's spin is aligned with the Z field. So when B is along Z, the spin is in the Sz eigenstate, right? So when the field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along Y, the spin will no longer be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. That means it'll start evolving over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by H = -mu · B. So initially, H was proportional to Sz, and then it changes to proportional to Sy.

Wait, let's write that more carefully. The magnetic moment mu for a spin-1/2 particle is given by mu = γ S, where S
