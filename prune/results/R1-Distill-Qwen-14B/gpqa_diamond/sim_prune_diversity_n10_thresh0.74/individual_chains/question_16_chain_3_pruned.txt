Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's a chiral center, or maybe some other form of asymmetry like an axial chirality or something else. I remember that a compound is optically active if it has no plane of symmetry and is not superimposable on its mirror image.

Alright, let's go through each compound one by one. I'll list them out as I read them.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
   Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second carbon. So structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)CH2CH3? Or wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, so CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but that can't be right because it's but-1-ene. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, the formula for but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, and methyl on C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's actually Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)), and then C3 would be CH2, and C4 CH3.

Wait, but wait, the configuration is Z. Now, for a double bond, the substituents on each side determine the configuration. So in (Z), the higher priority groups are on the same side.

But does this compound have a chiral center? Let me think. For a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. Let me look at the structure.

C1 is Cl
