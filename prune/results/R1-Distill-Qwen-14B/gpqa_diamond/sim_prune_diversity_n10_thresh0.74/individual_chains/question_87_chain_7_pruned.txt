Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to choose the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring because it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. The substituents would be two groups attached to the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, wait, the benzene ring itself accounts for 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. So each substituent is probably one carbon each, unless one substituent has two carbons. But wait, since there are two substituents, maybe each is a single carbon group.

Wait, but it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. Let's think about possible groups attached. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents are likely a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester?) and a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I). Or wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a substituent that's more complex, and the other substituent is the halogen.

Wait, but the substituents are probably two different groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. Because the question mentions both a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe a nitro groupâ€” but wait, nitro doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde), and the other substituent is a halogen, say Cl.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene ring would be two groups. Let me think about the structure. The ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group (like a ket
