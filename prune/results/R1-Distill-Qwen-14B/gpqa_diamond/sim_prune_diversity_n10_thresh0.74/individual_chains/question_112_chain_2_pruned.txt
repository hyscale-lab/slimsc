Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. The problem involves an electron state and some operator. Hmm, let me read it again.

The state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional means it's a scalar multiple, but I think for probabilities, the normalization won't matter because we'll normalize it. So first, I need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of the given operator.

The operator's matrix Aij is such that if i ≠ j, Aij = ħ/2, else zero. So the matrix is 2x2 because it's spin, right? So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of Sz, the z-projection of spin. But the operator given here isn't Sz. Let me write down what matrix A looks like.

Matrix A would be:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2. So rows and columns are 1 and 2, corresponding to |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the problem says the operator whose matrix is A. So we're dealing with an operator other than Sz. So the eigenstates of this operator are different from |up> and |down>, I think. So when the question says "eigenstates of the operator", that's different from the |up> and |down> states.

So the problem is in two parts: first, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A, and second, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, but how? Because the state |alpha> is given in the |up>, |down> basis, which are the eigenstates of Sz. But the operator A has its own eigenstates, say |+> and |->, which are different. So to find probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A is a spin-flip operator or something. Let me think about the eigenstates of A.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.

Matrix A:
