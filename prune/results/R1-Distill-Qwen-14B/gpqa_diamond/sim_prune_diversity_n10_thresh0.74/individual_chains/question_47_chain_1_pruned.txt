Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which compound matches the given data. Let's see, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's helpful. And there are several spectroscopic data points: IR and 1H NMR.

First, looking at the IR. The strong bands at around 3400 and 3300 cm^-1 probably indicate N-H or O-H stretching. But looking more closely, those are in the range of N-H, especially if they are medium to strong. Wait, but O-H like in a carboxylic acid would be broader and maybe around 2500-3300, but these are two distinct bands. Alternatively, maybe they're from an amide or an alcohol. Or perhaps an amine. Wait, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is a key clue. That's a carbonyl group. So maybe an amide or ester or maybe a ketone. But esters and amides typically have carbonyls around 1700-1750. So in this case, 1720 is probably an ester or an amide.

Now, the options are A to D. Let me look at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzene ring with an ethoxy group at position 3 and a benzamide group (CONH2) at position something? Wait, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxy would be another substituent. So positions 3 and... wait, benzamide is usually para to something else? Maybe not. Let me think about the NMR.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is HCONR2, but in this case, it's N-substituted. So the structure would be HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So that's a formamide group attached to the benzene ring at the para position to the ethoxy.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. So propionate is CH2CH2COO- as the ester. So it would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-(4-phenyl). Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to an amino group.
