Okay, let me try to figure out this organic chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll walk through each step carefully.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. The goal is to find how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are given as A) 6, B) 8, C)10, D)7.

Let me break down each reaction step by step.

First Reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When it reacts with bromine (Br2), I think this is an addition reaction. Specifically, I remember that ketones can undergo halogenation, but wait, bromine under certain conditions can add to the carbonyl group. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a cyclic structure. So adding bromine would likely be an electrophilic addition. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When it reacts with bromine in a non-polar solvent, it probably undergoes an enol formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? Or perhaps it's a diaddition across the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone reacting with excess bromine (Br2) in a diethyl ether solution would lead to the formation of a dibromide. Wait, more accurately, cyclohexanone can undergo a bromination on the carbonyl carbon. Oh, right! The bromine adds across the carbonyl group. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane or something similar. Let me think: the carbonyl (C=O) becomes C-Br, and the oxygen picks up a Br as well? No, wait, when Br2 adds to a carbonyl, it's a conjugate addition? Or maybe the bromine adds across the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: cyclohexanone has a ketone group. Adding bromine in a typical scenario would lead to a bromohydrin if it's a single addition. But wait, if the ketone is treated with excess Br2, perhaps it adds two equivalents. Wait, no, maybe the initial step is the formation of a bromide on the cyclohexane ring. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another angle: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Reacting with Br2, perhaps it's a diaddition. So the double bond (C
