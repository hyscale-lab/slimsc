Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, I remember that p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. 

The problem states that the coupled angular momentum state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, what does that mean? So, l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is given as 2 here. And m is the magnetic quantum number for the total, which is -1.

I remember that when combining two angular momenta, the total l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both are 1, the possible l's are 0, 1, 2. But in this case, the coupled state is for l=2 and m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. So we're looking at L_z for each particle and the probability that both measurements give -ℏ. 

Each electron's orbital angular momentum along z is given by L1z and L2z. The eigenvalues for these are m * ℏ. So for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1 because l=1. 

In the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>, we're supposed to find the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ℏ. So, in other words, for each electron, m1 and m2 are -1. 

Wait, but in the coupled state, the total m is m = m1 + m2. Here, the total m is -1. So if m1 is -1 and m2 is -1, then m1 + m2 = -2, but the given state has m=-1. That can't be possible, can it? Because if both m1 and m2 are -1, their sum is -2, which is not equal to the total m of -1.

So that means that the two electrons can't both have m1=-1 and m2=-1 in this coupled state. Because that sum would be -2, which doesn't match the total m of
