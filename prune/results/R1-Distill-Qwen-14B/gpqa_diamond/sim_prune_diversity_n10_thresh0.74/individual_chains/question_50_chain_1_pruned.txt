Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams are used to visualize particle interactions, and loops in these diagrams correspond to higher-order processes in perturbation theory. Each loop generally adds a factor that contributes to the complexity of the calculation.

The question is about figuring out how many loops the diagram has based on the given expression. The expression provided is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down.

Wait, I think the general structure of Feynman diagrams and loop integrals relates to the number of loops. Each loop contributes a certain factor, usually involving integrals over momenta, which are often regularized and lead to terms involving powers of pi and other constants.

I recall that each loop typically brings in a factor of (4pi)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Since the problem is in four-dimensional spacetime, d=4, so each loop would contribute a factor of (4pi)^2, I think. Because (4pi)^{4/2} = (4pi)^2.

Wait, but the denominator here is (4pi)^6. Let me see. If each loop contributes (4pi)^2 in the denominator (since loop integrals often give factors with (4pi)^something in the denominator when you do dimensional regularization or other methods), then the number of loops would be the exponent divided by the per-loop contribution.

The denominator is (4pi)^6. So each loop gives (4pi)^2 in the denominator. So 6 divided by 2 is 3 loops. So maybe the answer is D) 3.

But wait, I should think about other factors. Let's see. The overall expression is alpha^3 g^2 ... So alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that. But in terms of perturbation theory, each vertex in a Feynman diagram contributes factors like alpha, and the number of vertices relates to the number of propagators and loops.

Wait, but the expression is an estimate for the size of a loop diagram. The general form for a loop integral in 4D is something like (alpha/(4pi))^L, where L is the number of loops. Or wait, maybe each loop brings a factor of 1
