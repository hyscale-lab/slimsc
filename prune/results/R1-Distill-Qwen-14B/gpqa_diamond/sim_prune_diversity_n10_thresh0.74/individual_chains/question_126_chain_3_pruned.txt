Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with a different compound. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each will show.

Let me first look at Reaction I:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Wait, LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. Hexan-3-one is a ketone. When a ketone is reduced with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the structure would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, wait, the starting compound is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Hmm, but after reduction, the configuration at the alcohol might change? Wait, no, the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol doesn't change the configuration of existing stereocenters. The starting material is (S) configuration at the 5th carbon (the methoxy group), so the resulting alcohol should retain that.

Wait, actually, the ketone is at the 3rd carbon, so the molecule is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, wait: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But the 5th carbon (counting from the start) has a methoxy group. Let me count: first carbon is CH3, second CH2, third C(O), fourth CH2, fifth CH(OCH3), sixth CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, perhaps it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So when I reduce that ketone (3rd position) with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol at the 3rd position. So the product is 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon.

So Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3). So it's a diketone. Reducing a diketone with NaBH4. Wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent but not as strong as LAH. However, I remember that NaBH4 can't reduce esters or amides, but it can reduce ketones.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. So when treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, each ketone group would be reduced to an alcohol. But wait, NaBH4 usually doesn't reduce both ketones in a diketone unless under certain conditions. Wait, but the question says excess NaBH4, so perhaps both ketone groups are reduced.

Wait, but wait, when you have two ketone groups, each will be reduced. So each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So pentane-2,4-dione would become 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure would be HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no. Let me think: pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are ketones.

So the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. Reducing each ketone would give CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, what about the configuration? Each ketone is a planar sp2 center. When reduced to an alcohol, each becomes an sp3 center. But since the reducing agent (NaBH4) is not a chiral source, the reduction will proceed with a possible racemic mixture, but wait, NaBH4 is not a chiral reagent, so the product would be a racemic mixture of each alcohol, but wait, the two ketones are in positions 2 and 4. So each would reduce to an alcohol, but the question is whether each reduction leads to a chiral center.

In pentane-2,4-dione, the carbons 2 and 4 are both ketones. For each, when reduced, becomes an alcohol. Now, carbon 2: in the starting material, it's connected to two CH3 groups and two carbonyls. Wait, no: structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. So the carbons 2 and 4 are each connected to a carbonyl group and two CH2 groups.

Wait, actually, each of the carbons 2 and 4 is connected to two other carbons and a carbonyl group. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-

2: C(O)

3: CH2-

4: C(O)

5: CH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, pentane has five carbons. 2 and 4 are the ketone positions. So the structure is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

So carbon 2: connected to C-1 (CH3), C-3 (CH2), and the carbonyl group. So when reduced, becomes CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait.

Wait, after reduction, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So:

- Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 4: CH(OH)-

So the product is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, let me reconstruct. The original molecule is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So the structure becomes:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

But wait, each of these CH(OH) groups is on a carbon that's connected to two CH2 groups. So for carbon 2, let's see: it is connected
