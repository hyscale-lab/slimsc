Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so X here must be a specific ion.

The problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons make 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC. I think this is a relativistic mechanics problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c). So I should probably use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I should figure out the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is given by E = mc². But I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6 off the top of my head. I think I can find it by looking up the atomic mass. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a standard value or an approximation.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the mass using the number of protons and neutrons. The mass of a nucleus can be approximated as the sum of the masses of its nucleons. A proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. But wait, I think the mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the sum because of binding energy, but since the problem is about relativistic speeds, maybe I need to consider the exact rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the deuteron or another known value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think, the typical atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy would be 6.014 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Let me calculate this.

6.014 * 931.5 = let's see, 6 * 931.5 is 5589, and 0.014 * 931.5 is about 13.041. So total is approximately 5589 +13.041 = 5602.041 MeV, which is about 5.602 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, so maybe the exact mass is needed. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the binding energy, but that might complicate things. For this problem, maybe using the approximate mass is sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is known, but I'm not recalling it. Let me think again. Alternatively, let's proceed with the formula for relativistic energy.

The total energy (E) of a particle is given by gamma * m c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c. So beta (β) is 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Wait, let me double-check 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is about 3.5714286.

So E = gamma * m c². Now, what's m? The mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think I can find it using the periodic table's atomic mass.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.014 atomic mass units. As I calculated earlier, 6.014 u is roughly 5.602 GeV/c². Wait, wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.014 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.014 * 931.5 = ? Let me compute that more accurately.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. 0.014 * 931.5 = 13.041 MeV
