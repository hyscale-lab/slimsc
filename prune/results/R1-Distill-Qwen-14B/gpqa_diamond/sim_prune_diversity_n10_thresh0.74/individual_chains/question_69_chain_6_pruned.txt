Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various resolutions in meters.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by E/(m c²), right? Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². Oh wait, but wait, the mass is given in GeV, and energy is also in GeV. So if I use natural units where c=1, then gamma is just E/m. So E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me do the division. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 *8 is 27.28. Wait, 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41*(8-0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. So 27 is a bit more than 7.9. So gamma≈27 /3.41 ≈ around 7.915.

So gamma is approximately 7.915. Therefore, the observed lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. So tau = 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.915 *8 is about 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s = 6.332e-15 s.

Now, the next part is about the resolution needed in the bubble chamber. The bubble chamber's resolution determines how well it can measure the position of the decay. The minimum resolution probably refers to the uncertainty in the position where the decay occurs, which is related to the particle's speed and the lifetime.

Wait, the decay can only be observed if the particles decay within the chamber, or that the decay products are detected. But more importantly, the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is v * τ. But since the lifetime is extended by gamma, the decay length is beta gamma c tau_0. Because v is beta c, and tau is gamma tau_0.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau_0. Wait, because beta is v/c, so v = beta
