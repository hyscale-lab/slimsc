Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question here. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops in the Sun's core. Let me think about what I know about the Sun's fusion processes and neutrino production.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. And the pp-III branch probably involves some specific reactions that produce neutrinos. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches, but the main one produces helium-4 and emits neutrinos.

So neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, specifically electron neutrinos (ν_e) from the reactions in the pp chain. The most common type of neutrino from the Sun is the ν_e, but there are others like ν_mu and ν_tau, but in this question, flavor changes aren't considered, so I can ignore oscillations. So we're only looking at the production rates.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the core reactions stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we wouldn't see any change in the solar luminosity yet because the photons haven't reached us. But for neutrinos, since they barely interact, they can escape almost immediately from the core. So stopping the pp-III branch would affect the neutrino flux almost instantly on Earth.

But wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands. So I need to think about the energy spectrum of neutrinos produced in the pp-III branch and other branches.

The pp chain has a few branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, where two protons collide to form a deuteron and emit a positron and a neutrino. The pp-II branch involves a different reaction path, perhaps with higher energies. The pp-III branch is another step, maybe producing higher energy neutrinos.

Wait, in the pp chain, each step releases energy, and the neutrinos produced have a certain energy distribution. The pp-I branch produces lower energy neutrinos, and each subsequent branch (like pp-II and pp-III) might produce higher energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the flux from that part would drop, but the other branches might still be active.

Wait, no. The question says that all other reactions remain
