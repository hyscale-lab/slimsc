Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question gives me the production energy, mass, and width of the meson X. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its speed. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * tau * beta, where c is the speed of light, tau is the lifetime, and beta is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But how do I find tau, the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but the units here are a bit tricky. Let me make sure. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units that include MeV·s or something like that. Let me recall: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, since Γ is in MeV, I need to convert units properly.

So, m_X is 1.2 GeV, E_X is 8 GeV. But maybe E isn't directly needed here. Wait, the problem is about decay distance, which depends on the particle's lifetime and velocity.

Wait, the velocity beta (β) can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So the energy E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². But I think for mesons, since they're bosons, and assuming they are moving at relativistic speeds, the momentum can be found using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So, E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (8)^2 = (p c)^2 + (1.2)^2. Solving for p c: (p c) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV / c. Then, the momentum p is gamma m v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m is rest mass, and v is velocity. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I should go that way. Alternatively, beta can be found using beta = pc / E. Let me see, because in terms of beta and gamma, we have beta = v/c = p c / (E).

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) → approximately 0.98875. So about 0.9888c.

So now, the lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, I need to convert Γ to Ge
