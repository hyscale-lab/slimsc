Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with dyes and the colors they absorb. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs light, it reflects or emits the complementary color. Wait, but in this question, the dye emits light with a certain energy. So, I think I need to figure out which color corresponds to that energy.

The question states that the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. Oh right, energy and wavelength are inversely related. The formula I remember is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, right?

Wait, but wait: actually, in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum, higher energy photons are at the blue end (shorter wavelength), and lower energy is at the red end (longer wavelength). So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, what's the corresponding wavelength?

Let me calculate that. I think Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy given is in electron volts, so I should convert that to joules. Oh wait, 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that.

2.3393 * 1.602e-1
