Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transiting exoplanets are detected when they pass in front of their host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. 

The question says both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which I think might mean their eccentricity doesn't affect the transit probability much here. 

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, star mass and radius aren't always directly related, but here they have the same radius. So their sizes are the same, which would make the transit probabilities depend more on other factors like the orbital parameters.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5)), but since e is zero (they have circular orbits), the formula simplifies. Also, the formula is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / a) * (1/(1 - e^2))^0.5, but with e=0, it's just (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1)) so it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 times something else.

Wait, maybe the formula is more accurately P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) * (something else). No, I think I'm mixing things up. The transit probability is mainly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (n * a)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), but perhaps more accurately, it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5)), but again, e is zero here.

Wait, another thought: the probability of transit depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The closer the planet is to the star, the higher the chance it transits because the orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. Wait, no, that's not right. The probability is actually more about the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. So the formula is something like (R_*/a)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which, for circular orbits, is just the orbital radius). So higher a (farther away) would mean lower probability, since (R_*/a)^2 is smaller.

Wait, no, the probability is actually given by (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (a (1-e^2)^0.5)) * (something else?), but I think in the case of circular orbits (e=0), the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_*)^2 * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)) becomes 1/a. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / a) * (something else), but perhaps more accurately, it's (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)) * ( (1 / (n)) ), where n is the number of planets or something else? Or maybe the formula is (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_*)^2 multiplied by (1 / a). Because the probability depends on the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance. So, a planet
