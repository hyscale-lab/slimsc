Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Let me read it again. So, we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. The goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, right? And when it reacts with a strong acid, they should neutralize each other. The acid is monobasic, so one H+ ion per molecule. Strong acid means it's completely dissociated, so H+ ions are plentiful.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The formula for iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)3. The molar mass would be the sum of the atomic masses of Fe, O, and H.

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1.008. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate that. Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17.008 (16 + 1.008). So three OH groups would be 3 * 17.008 = 51.024. So 55.85 +51.024 equals 106.874 g/mol. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. The mass is 0.1 grams.

Moles = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let me calculate that precisely. 0.1 divided by 106.874... Let's see, 106.874 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.1. Hmm, yeah, so approximately 0.0009359 moles.

Wait, wait: 0.1 / 106.874 = 0.0009358 mol. That's about 9.358 x 10^-4 moles.

Now, the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, say HCl, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl.

So for 0.0009358 moles of Fe(OH)3, we need 0.0009358 * 3 = 0.0028075 moles of HCl.

The HCl is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles divided by concentration. Volume = 0.0028075 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028075 L, which is 28.075 cm³.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid
