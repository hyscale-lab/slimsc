Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's read the question again.

The question says we're observing a single atom. We know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, right now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So, 50 minutes have gone by, and it's still there. Now, we're looking ahead to the next 150 minutes. So total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Maybe I should think in terms of probabilities.

Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So each atom has a certain probability of decaying over a certain time, and the process is memoryless. That means the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh wait, but in this case, we know that 50 minutes have passed without decay. Does that affect the probability?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the decay process is exponential, and the probability of decay in a certain time is given by N(1 - e^(-λt)), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But since we're dealing with probabilities for a single atom, it's a bit different.

Wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. Let me denote P(100) = 32% = 0.32.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the decay process. The key here is that radioactive decay is a random process, but it follows an exponential law. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is P(t) = e^(-λt). So the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

But the problem gives me P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So I can find λ.

Let me write that equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating that: ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get more precise. Let me compute ln(0.68) using a calculator. Wait, I don't have
