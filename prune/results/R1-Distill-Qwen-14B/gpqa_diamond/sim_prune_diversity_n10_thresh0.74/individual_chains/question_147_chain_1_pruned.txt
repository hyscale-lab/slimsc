Okay, so I have this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me think. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess the initial kinetic energy isn't too large. The mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. 

Wait, wait. Protons and antiprotons annihilate each other. But the products are two A⁺ and two A⁻. So the total charge must be conserved. Let's see: proton is +e, antiproton is -e. So together, that's zero charge. On the product side, 2A⁺ is +2e, 2A⁻ is -2e. So zero charge total. Okay, charge is conserved.

But how about energy and momentum? Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think the initial kinetic energy isn't too much, but we might have to consider conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some low speed? Or are both moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so probably in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. That would make sense.

Wait, but in the annihilation process, the initial particles are p and p̄. If the antiproton is moving slowly, then the initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. So the initial momentum is p_p = gamma * m_p * v_p. But since v_p is small, gamma is about 1, so p_p ≈ m_p v_p.

After annihilation, the products are four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let's assume they're all moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving symmetrically, but that's not clear.

Wait, but the problem is probably looking for the velocity of each A particle, assuming they all have the same velocity, which is a simplification. So let's think about this.

Conservation of energy and momentum. Let's set up the equations.

First, the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and
