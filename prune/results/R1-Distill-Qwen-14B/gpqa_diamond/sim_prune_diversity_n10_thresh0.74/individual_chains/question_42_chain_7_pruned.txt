Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant for this problem. The question is more about their orbital periods, right?

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Hmm. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, let me write that down:

T_eq ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.4
T_eq ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 2.3

So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by a factor of 2.3. So, the order from hottest to coolest would be Planet1 > Planet2 > Planet3.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So mass of Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. So, the masses are Planet1 > Planet2 > Planet3 as well.

But wait, the question is about the orbital periods. So, I need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

The problem also states that the albedo for all three is 0.3, like Earth. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ]^(1/4). Or wait, the exact formula might differ, but I think it's roughly proportional to sqrt(L/(D^2)) ), but considering the planet's albedo.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, D is the planet's orbital distance. But maybe in this problem, since we're comparing planets around the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all, so the equilibrium temperature ratio would depend on the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio. Because T_eq is proportional to sqrt(L/(16πσ D² (1-a) )) )^(1/4). Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) for a planet is given by:

T_eq = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4 )

Assuming L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the orbital distance, and σ is the Stefan-B
