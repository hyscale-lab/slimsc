Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a compound has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, the opposite: if it doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral. Chirality requires a carbon with four different substituents.

So the question is asking how many of the given compounds are optically active. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but in but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2-CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. The structure is CHCl2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but wait: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-
