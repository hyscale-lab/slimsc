Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Let's see.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. Oh wait, the star's properties are similar to the Sun in some ways, but a bit hotter or bigger? No, the Sun's Teff is about 5778 K, so 6300 is hotter. But wait, the radius is 1.2 times the Sun's. Interesting.

The planets are both detected via transit and RV methods. Their masses are 7 and 5 Earth masses. Radii are 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, so that won't affect the calculation.

The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. I think the formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (L/L_sun)^0.5? Wait, maybe I should think differently. Oh wait, equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2D)), where D is the distance from the star. Because the star's flux at distance D is (L / (4π D²)), and the planet absorbs it (assuming no albedo, but here albedo is same so it doesn't matter). The planet emits as a blackbody, so the equilibrium is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2D)).

Wait, no. Alternatively, another approach: The flux from the star at the planet's distance is F = L / (4π a²), where a is the orbital radius. The planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by F = σ T_eq^4 / (1 - α), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and α is the albedo. But since both planets have the same albedo, it cancels out.

So T_eq = [ (L / (16 π² a² σ) ) ]^(1/4) * (1/(1 - α))^(1/4). But since albedos are same, we can ignore that part when taking the ratio.

But L, the star's luminosity, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting that into the T_eq equation:

T_eq = [ (4π R_star² σ T_star^4 ) / (4 π a² σ) ) ]^(1/4) * (1/(1 - α))^(1/4)

Wait, simplifying inside the brackets: 4π cancels, R² / a², etc.

So the inside becomes (R_star² T_star^4 ) / a².

So,

T_eq = [ (R_star² T_star^4) / (a²) ]^(1/4)

Which is same as T_eq = T_star * ( R_star / (a) )^(1/2) * (1/ (a) )^(1/4) ?

Wait, no, let's re-express that. Let me compute the exponents correctly. The term
