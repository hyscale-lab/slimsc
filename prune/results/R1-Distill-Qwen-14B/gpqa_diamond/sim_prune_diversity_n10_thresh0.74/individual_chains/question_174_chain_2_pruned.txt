Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can think it through.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Wait, 300 GeV? That's like a huge energy, but okay, nuclei can have high rest mass energies. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. Oh right, fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a lot of energy.

The problem states that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let's say the masses are m1 and m2. So m1 = 2 * m2. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Oh wait, because 99% of initial mass M, so 0.99 times M.

Wait, but wait. Wait, is this the rest mass? So the original nucleus is at rest, and when it splits, the two fragments' rest masses add up to 99% of M. So the mass defect is 1% of M, which must be converted into binding energy or kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, some mass is converted into energy.

But wait, when a nucleus undergoes fission, the total mass of the products is less than the original nucleus. Because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms. So yeah, so the initial nucleus's rest mass is M, and the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M, so the mass defect is 0.01 M.

So the energy released would be due to this mass defect. But wait, in the problem, they're asking about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. Oh, right, the problem says the more massive fragment has kinetic energy T1. And we need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I think the approach is to first compute T1 relativistically, then compute it using classical mechanics, and then find the difference.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.
2. Find the total energy released (mass defect times c²).
3. Use conservation of energy and momentum (since initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero) to find the kinetic energies of the two fragments.
4. Calculate the relativistic kinetic energy for the more massive fragment.
5. Calculate the non-relativistic (classical) approximation of its kinetic energy.
6. Find the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical T1.

Wait, but first, let's compute the masses.

We know that m1 = 2 m2. And m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum equation:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M.

So m1 = 2 *
