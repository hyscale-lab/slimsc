Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still getting the hang of these reactions.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. Its structure is something like CH₂=CH–C(=O)–CHO? Wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Oh right, it's benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached. So it's actually Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, no. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait. No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO. Wait, no, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound where the aldehyde group is attached to a propenyl group. So it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing this up. Let me visualize it: cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a double bond. So it's benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So the structure is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph
