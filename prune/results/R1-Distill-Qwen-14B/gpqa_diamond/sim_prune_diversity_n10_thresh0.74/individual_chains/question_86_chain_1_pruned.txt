Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions where different reducing agents are used, and I need to figure out the starting materials A and B. The products from both reactions are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively.

Hmm, wait, the products are enantiomers of each other because one is R and the other is S. So, the starting materials must somehow lead to these opposite configurations. 

The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent compared to BH3. Both are used for reductions, but I think LiBH4 is typically used in more polar solvents and is a stronger reducing agent. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe the type of reducing agent affects the stereochemistry of the product?

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. LiBH4 is more commonly used for reducing carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes. But wait, is it the reducing agent that's causing the stereochemistry here? Or is it the starting material's configuration that's determining the product's configuration?

Wait, maybe I should consider the reaction mechanisms. Both reactions are reductions, but perhaps they're different types of reductions. Let me think about the possible structures of the starting materials. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with an oxygen, so like a tetrahydropyran ring with a ketone group. The substituents are ethyl and some others.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else being reduced. Or maybe they're carbonyl compounds that are being reduced in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe it's about the reduction of an ester or another group.

Wait, looking at the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is a six-membered ring with oxygen. The ketone is at position 2, and
