Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a series of reactions. 

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, ethan-1-one is acetone, which has a ketone group (C=O) at the end of a two-carbon chain. The phenyl group attached to the acetone has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. So, on the benzene ring, we have a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5 relative to the point of attachment of the acetone. 

Wait, let me visualize that. The point of attachment is position 1 (since it's 3-bromo and 5-nitro, they are on the ring attached to the acetone). So the benzene ring is connected to the acetone at position 1. Then, position 3 (meta to position 1) is bromine, and position 5 (which is para to position 3) is nitro. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 3 and 5 are both meta to each other relative to position 1. Hmm, maybe it's better to number them as 1 (point of attachment), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). 

So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions, which are both meta to each other. So, the benzene ring should have Br at 3 and NO2 at 5, both relative to the ketone group's point of attachment.

Now, the starting material is benzene. I need to perform a series of reactions to add these substituents in the correct positions and form the ketone group. 

Let me think about the typical reactions involved in such synthesis. Acetophenone derivatives usually come from some kind of acylation reaction. AcCl or similar reagents with AlCl3 as a catalyst (Friedel-Crafts acylation) would add the ketone group. But wait
