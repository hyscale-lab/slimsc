Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves a chemist performing two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options give different outcomes for the number of peaks observed in each.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The reaction is an electrocyclic opening? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. And the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but what's the regiochemistry here? Oct-4-ene has the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So when mCPBA adds, it should form an epoxide ring between those two carbons.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Since (E) is trans, the epoxide formed would be trans. Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated, so the epoxide would be cis.

Wait, but wait. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is a concerted process, so the stereochemistry of the starting alkene dictates the configuration of the epoxide. So (E)-oct-4-ene would form a trans epoxide, and (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide.

Then, after forming the epoxide, both reactions are followed by treatment with aqueous acid. Oh, right, acid catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. The ring-opening of epoxides in acidic conditions typically involves the attack
