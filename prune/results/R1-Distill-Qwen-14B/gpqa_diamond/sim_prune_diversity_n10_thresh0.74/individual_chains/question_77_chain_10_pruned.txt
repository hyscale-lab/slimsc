Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and forms a new structure with a different arrangement of double bonds. The reaction is usually triggered by heat or light, and it's a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Right, that's part of the Claisen and Cope rearrangements family.

The problem has two parts, A and B, so I need to figure out the major products for both. Let's start with part A.

Part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. BuLi is a strong base, so I think that's deprotonating something. Wait, but the Cope rearrangement is about 1,5-dienes. Let me look at the structure of the starting material.

The molecule is benzene with a substituent: (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Breaking that down: the substituent is a methylene group (CH2) attached to an oxygen (O), which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is like benzene-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-C(CH3)- something. Wait, butane has four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, but-2-ene is CH2CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, structure:

But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with double bond between C2 and C3? No, but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- as a substituent. But in this case, it's 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. Hmm, wait: but has four carbons. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-, but that's three carbons. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2C=CHCH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. The substituent is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or another arrangement. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the substituent is 3-methyl
