Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here. Let's see, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14, which I think is important because it can tell me about the structure. The mixture is 1:1, and the NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm each, in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down the molecular formula. C10H14, so the degree of unsaturation. Let me calculate that. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be one benzene ring (which is three double bonds, so three degrees) and one more double bond or a ring. But wait, benzene is one ring, which counts as three (like three double bonds equivalent). So the four would mean another ring or a double bond, but since all compounds are aromatic, probably another ring. Wait, no, wait. Wait, molecular formula for benzene is C6H6. C10H14 would be C6H6 plus four more carbons and eight more hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each compound is a substituted benzene with methyl groups or something. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, all options except C have tetramethylbenzenes. Option C has one tetramethyl and one diethyl.

So first, the aromatic region. The problem states that in the NMR, there are two singlets around 6.7 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally, but each has a different number of protons in their aromatic regions. Wait, but each compound's aromatic protons might be split into singlets if they are equivalent.

Wait, so each compound would have a certain number of equivalent protons. Let's think about each option.

But wait, each compound in the options is a tetramethylbenzene except option C's second compound, which is 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, diethyl would be -CH2CH2- attached to the ring. So for 1,4-diethylbenzene, the structure would have two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene
