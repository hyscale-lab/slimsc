Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure how mass plays into this. Maybe it's just extra info or perhaps it's relevant for something else, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe mass isn't directly needed here. Let's see.

The given data includes elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in stars. The elements involved here are Si, Fe, Mg, and H.

Let's list out the given values:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The photospheric composition of the Sun is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

I think I need to find the ratio [Si/Star_2] divided by [Si/Star_1], but wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I think the question is asking (Si in Star_1) / (Si in Star_2) = ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have abundance ratios like [X/Y], it's log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Oh right, because [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So each of these is relative to the Sun's abundance.

So, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, which makes sense because it's the reference. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which implies that the iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. Because [Fe/H] is log (n_Fe/n_H / n_Fe,n_H_sun ). Since Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, that means n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is same as in Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so n_Mg/n_H in Star_2 is same as in Sun.

So let me try to get the solar abundances first. The Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, so its [Fe/H] is 0. Similarly for Mg. But wait, the given data for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Let me parse that.

So, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

Wait, but actually, I think the notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for the Sun:

For Fe: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → which implies that nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH / nFe,nH_sun) ) = 0 → so same.

So, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) ) = 0.3.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The notation [X/Y] = log (n_X/n_Y) - log (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) × 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) × 10^0.3.

Also, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg_2 / nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

So, we need to find the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Because the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

So, let's compute nSi_1 and nSi_2.

First, for Star_1.

We know that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun × (nH_1 / nH_sun). Because nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH_1.

But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of solar values. Let me think about the photosphere in terms of number densities.

Let me denote the number density of H in the Sun as nH_sun, and for each star as nH_1 and nH_2.

But since the stars have different atmospheric compositions, their nH might be different. Wait, but wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

But I'm not sure if we can relate nH_1 and nH_2 directly. Maybe in the end, when taking the ratio of silicon, the nH will cancel out. Let's see.

So, for Star_1:

Compute nSi_1.

We have [Si/Fe]
