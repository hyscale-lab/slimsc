Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question says that there's a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, aromatic compounds with C10H14. Oh wait, benzene rings with substituents. Because the molecular formula for toluene is C7H8, so if each substituent adds a methyl group, like in dimethylbenzene, each methyl adds one C and three H's. Wait, no: wait, each methyl is CH3. So each substitution replaces a hydrogen. So for a benzene ring (C6H6), adding a methyl group would give C7H7, but wait, wait no, actually, each substituent replaces a H. So for a benzene with four methyl groups, it's C10H14? Let me think. Benzene has six carbons. Each methyl adds a carbon, so four methyl groups would add four C's, making 6+4=10. For H: benzene has 6 H. Each methyl has 3 H. So 4*3=12, plus 6-4 (since four H's are replaced by substituents) = 2 H. 12 + 2 = 14. Oh wait, no: wait, benzene has six H. Each substitution replaces one H. So if there are four substituents, four H's are replaced, leaving 6-4=2 H. The substituents each add 3 H (from methyl groups), so 4*3=12. So total H = 2 + 12 =14. So yes, C10H14. So both compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, each with four methyl groups, but different substitution patterns.

The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm. That's in the aromatic region. Singlets mean no neighboring H's. So each aromatic proton is isolated, meaning each is in a position where there are no adjacent protons. Wait, but in a benzene ring with substituents, if two substituents are adjacent, the H's next to them would be ortho, meta, etc. Wait, but if a substituent is para to another, maybe the H's are more deshielded. Alternatively, maybe in some cases, the substitution leads to equivalent protons that are all singlets.

Wait, let's think about the aromatic region. If each compound is a tetramethylbenzene, the substitution pattern determines how many unique H environments there are and their splitting. For example, if the substituents are all in such a way that the remaining Hs are equivalent and each is isolated, then each would be a singlet.

Wait, but the NMR shows two singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each compound contributes equally. So each compound has a set of aromatic Hs that are a singlet, and their signals are integrated in a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, each compound has two different sets of aromatic Hs as singlets, but that would complicate the integration. Hmm, but the question says two signals in the aromatic region, each a singlet, 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet each. Because the mixture is 1:1, each signal integrates to 1, but wait, no, the question says two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each signal is from both compounds, but in a 1:1 ratio of the areas.

Wait, maybe each compound has one set of aromatic Hs that are a singlet. So in the mixture, each compound contributes its own singlet, but the areas are equal (1:1 ratio). So for example, the first compound has X aromatic Hs as a singlet, the second has Y aromatic Hs as a singlet. Then the NMR would have two singlets, each corresponding to X and Y in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but wait, the question says the two signals are singlets and are in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet is the same area. So each compound contributes equally to each signal. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, each compound has the same number of aromatic Hs, but in different positions, giving two singlets with equal integration.

Wait, but the NMR shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So the areas are equal. Each singlet would come from one compound, but their integration is the same. For instance, if each compound contributes one singlet, each with the same number of H's, then their signals would be equal in area.

Now, considering the substitution patterns.
