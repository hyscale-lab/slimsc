Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question about molecular symmetry, specifically C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules involves understanding the different types of symmetry elements like rotation axes, planes, etc. C3H symmetry refers to a molecule that has a three-fold rotational axis and three perpendicular two-fold axes. So, the molecule should look the same when rotated 120 degrees around that axis, and also have these mirror planes that are perpendicular to the main axis.

Wait, I think C3H is also called the trigonal pyramidal symmetry, right? Like ammonia (NH3) has this symmetry because it's trigonal pyramidal. So I need to look for a molecule that has a central trigonal structure, maybe with three substituents around it in a symmetric arrangement.

Looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Trifuran suggests three furan rings, and triphenylene implies three phenyl groups attached. Maybe it's a structure where three phenyl groups are attached symmetrically to a central part. I'm picturing something like three big substituents around a central core. If the core is symmetric, maybe it has a three-fold axis.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The name suggests a benzo group attached to a trifuran. Benzo is a benzene ring, so maybe it's a fused ring system with three furan rings attached to a benzene. Not sure about the symmetry here. Maybe the molecule isn't symmetric enough.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's (CH(CH3)2)3BO, right? The borate has three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetric. So three identical groups around a central atom. Wait, that's a trigonal structure because each isopropyl is like a substituent. So the central boron would have three identical groups, each isopropyl. So that's trigonal planar around B? Or maybe it's tetrahedral. Wait, the borate is [B(O-R)3], right? Boron usually has three substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So each O is connected to an isopropyl. So the molecule would have a central trigonal planar arrangement, but is that enough for C3H symmetry?

Wait, C3H symmetry needs a three-fold rotation axis and three two-fold axes perpendicular to it. In triisopropyl borate, each isopropyl group is a substituent. Since they're all the same and arranged symmetrically around boron, the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis. Also, each isopropyl has its own symmetry. But does it have the necessary mirror planes?

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have that because the molecule is trigonal planar, but not necessarily having the three perpendicular mirror planes. Wait, in ammonia, the NH3 molecule, it's trigonal pyramidal, so it has the C3H symmetry. Triisopropyl borate would have a trigonal planar (like BF3) but in that case, it's different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has the structure where B is in the center, with three O-R groups. O-R is the isopropyl. So the structure is similar to BF3, which is trigonal planar. But trigonal planar is different from trigonal pyramidal. The trigonal pyramidal has a central atom with three bonds and a lone pair, leading to a pyramid shape. Trigonal planar has three bonds and no lone pair, so it's flat. So in triisopropyl borate, the boron is probably trigonal planar, surrounded by three identical groups. So that would have a three-fold rotation axis, but not mirror planesâ€”wait, no, wait, it's symmetric. Each of the three substituents is the same, so when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis.

But for C3H symmetry, I think you also need three perpendicular C2 axes and a horizontal mirror plane. Do trigonal planar structures have that? I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's better to look at the other options.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. It's a bridge structure with six-membered rings. I think quinuclidine has a three-fold axis because it has three equivalent bridges. Wait, the structure is like a hexagon with three bridges, making it look like a triangular prism. So when you rotate it by 120 degrees, it looks the same. So that would have a three-fold rotation axis. Does it have the perpendicular two-fold axes? Let me imagine the structure. Quinuclidine has a bridgehead structure where three bridges meet, each bridge connecting two of the three bridgeheads. So each bridge is symmetrical. So, in terms of symmetry, yes, there are three-fold rotation (C3), and each bridge would have a mirror plane, perhaps. So it might have C3H symmetry.

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is like a triangular prism. The molecule has a central triangle where each corner is a bridgehead. Each bridge is equivalent, so rotating it 120 degrees would bring each bridge into the position of another. That suggests a C3 axis. Also, each of the three planes that bisect the molecule perpendicularly (each plane going through a bridge and the central axis) would be mirror planes. So that would make it have C3H symmetry, which includes C3 and three C2 axes.

So, which option between triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine has C3H symmetry?

Triisopropyl borate probably doesn't because it's trigonal planar, which is just a three-fold axis but perhaps not the surrounding mirror planes. Wait, no, actually, the trigonal planar doesn't have mirror planes. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is quinuclidine. Because its structure is more complex and has the necessary symmetry elements. Also, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... I'm not entirely sure about that structure. It's a fused furan with three phenyl groups attached. Maybe it's more symmetric.

Alternatively, the molecule in option B is benzo attached to a trifuran. That might not have the necessary symmetry. Option A has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran. So maybe the structure is symmetrical with three substituents around a central point, leading to C3H symmetry.

Wait, maybe each of the options is a different kind of structure. Let me think about each molecule's structure.

Triisopropyl borate: three isopropyl groups attached to a central boron. So each O is connected to B, and each R is isopropyl. So the molecule is symmetric, but is it C3H? Or is it just C3? Because in C3H, you also have three C2 axes perpendicular to the main C3 axis. So each of those would correspond to axes going through each isopropyl substituent. Hmm, maybe it does have that. Because each substituent is identical, so rotating 120 degrees around the central axis would bring them into each other's positions. And each substituent itself is symmetric, so perhaps the molecule does have the necessary mirror planes.

Quinuclidine: I'm pretty sure this has C3H symmetry because of its structure. Each of the three bridges is symmetric, leading to a three-fold rotation axis and the necessary mirror planes.

So between options C and D, which is correct.

Wait, the question is about which molecule has C3H symmetry. I think quinuclidine does. Let me think about ammonia, which has C3H symmetry. The central N has three H's and a lone pair arranged in a trigonal pyramid. So it's a C3H symmetry. So in the case of triisopropyl borate, the structure is more like trigonal planar, which is different. So ammonia has a central N with four substituents (three H and a lone pair), giving a trigonal pyramid. But triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar, which is a different geometry.

So the correct answer would have a structure similar to ammonia, which is the trigonal pyramidal. Quinuclidine's structure is more like a triangular prism, but perhaps that's not trigonal pyramidal. Wait, maybe I should look for a structure that's similar to a trigonal pyramid.

Wait, another thought: the molecule with three identical substituents around a central atom in a trigonal planar arrangement (like BF3) would have a C3 axis, but not the C3H because it lacks the mirror planes. Trigonal pyramidal (like NH3) would have C3H symmetry because it has the three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.

So in triisopropyl borate, the substituents are all the same, and arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. So the molecule would have a C3 axis but not the C3H symmetry because it doesn't have the mirror planes. Wait, but wait, maybe it does have the mirror planes. Because each substituent is identical, the molecule could have three mirror planes each bisecting two substituents and passing through the central atom. So that would make it have C3H symmetry.

Wait, in that case, triisopropyl borate would have C3H symmetry. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, quinuclidine, being a more rigid structure with three-fold symmetry, probably has C3H.

Alternatively, let me think about the other options. Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... Maybe the benzo is connected to three furan rings? If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has C3 symmetry. But I'm not sure if it has the mirror planes.

Wait, another approach: the options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I remember that quinuclidine has a tricyclic structure with three bridges, making it have a three-fold axis and the necessary mirror planes, so it's C3H.

Also, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it has a three-fold rotation axis and three mirror planes (each through a substituent and the central atom). That would give it C3H symmetry as well? Or does it, because in trigonal planar, the mirror planes are present but perpendicular to the C3 axis.

Wait, in trigonal planar molecules like BF3, they have a C3 axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it (each through a vertex and the center), making the symmetry C3v, which is a different point group than C3H. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the C3H symmetry is a subgroup of the octahedral group. Or maybe it's a different point group. Let me think: the C3H point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis and three C2 axes perpendicular to it, along with a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule has a main C3 axis, three C2 axes (each perpendicular to the main axis and at 60 degrees to each other), and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the main axis.

Wait, but in C3H, the horizontal mirror plane is present, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the C3H is the same as the D3h point group. No, D3h is a different point group, which includes more elements.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the notation. Alternatively, I should think about which of these molecules has a three-fold rotation axis and three two-fold axes perpendicular to it.

Quinuclidine's structure is a tricyclic system with three equivalent bridges. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, all the bridges look the same. So there's a three-fold rotation axis. Also, each bridge is symmetric, so the molecule should have mirror planes that bisect each bridge and the central axis. So yes, it has three C2 axes. So that would make it have C3H symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis but perhaps no mirror planes, because the molecule is planar. Wait, no, each substituent is the same, so maybe mirror planes exist.

Wait, I'm getting stuck between options C and D. So perhaps I should think about each molecule's structure.

Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure is a six-membered ring fused into three bridges, each connecting two bridgeheads. So when you look down the three-fold axis, you see three identical bridge structures. So rotation by 120 degrees brings each bridge into another's position. Also, each bridge has a mirror plane that goes through it and the central axis. So each of these mirror planes would contain a C2 axis (a line through the middle of each bridge and the central axis). So yes, quinuclidine has the C3H symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: The structure is trigonal planar, with three identical substituents. So when you rotate 120 degrees, it looks the same. It also has three mirror planes, each bisecting two substituents and passing through the central B. So yes, that would also have C3H symmetry.

Wait, but in that case, both options C and D would have C3H symmetry. But that can't be right, because the question is asking which of the following has it. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe triisopropyl borate is trigonal planar (so C3v symmetry) and not C3H. Because in the trigonal planar, the point group is D3h or C3v. Wait, no, the trigonal planar is D3h symmetry, which includes more symmetry elements. But in reality, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, which is D3h, but maybe it doesn't have the C3H symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the point groups. C3H is also called the trigonal pyramidal symmetry, which is the same as the NH3 molecule. The point group is C3v, but wait, no, C3H is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of symmetry elements. C3H has a three-fold rotation axis, three two-fold rotation axes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe the three mirror planes.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to eliminate the options. Let's go through each option:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. That's a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached. If the substituents are attached at symmetric positions, the molecule could have C3H symmetry. For example, each phenyl group is attached to a different part of the trifuran. If the phenyl groups are equally spaced around the central structure, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation axis. Also, each phenyl group might serve as a mirror plane. So this could have C3H symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. Here, the substituents are attached in a way that might not be symmetric enough. The benzo group could be in a position that breaks the symmetry, so perhaps this doesn't have C3H.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. As I thought earlier, it's trigonal planar, so maybe it has C3v symmetry, but not C3H.

Option D: quinuclidine. As discussed, it has a three-fold rotation axis and the necessary mirror planes, so it has C3H symmetry.

Wait, but another thought: the molecule in option A has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. If the phenyl groups are attached in a symmetrical way, perhaps at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the central structure, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis and mirror planes, leading to C3H symmetry.

Now I'm more confused because I'm not sure which of these molecules actually has this symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the answer options. The options are labeled A to D, and the choices are which of the four has C3H symmetry.

Another approach: look for the molecule with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point.

Triisopropyl borate definitely has three identical substituents on a central atom. So it's a good candidate. Quinuclidine has a bridged structure with three equivalent bridges, so it's another candidate.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is quinuclidine because it's a well-known molecule with C3H symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or D.

Wait, I think I should check what the structures are.

Quinuclidine: It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The structure is similar to a triangular prism, with three bridges connecting three pairs of bridgeheads. Each bridge is identical, so the molecule has a three-fold axis. Each bridge is in a plane that could serve as a mirror plane, leading to the necessary C2 axes. So it has C3H symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: Structure is O-R groups attached to B. Each R is isopropyl, which is symmetric. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and three mirror planes each through a substituent and the central B. So yes, it has C3H symmetry.

Wait, so both options C and D could have C3H symmetry. But the question gives four options, with each being a different molecule.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Quinuclidine's structure is a tricyclic compound with three bridges, each of which is equivalent. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Also, each bridge has a mirror plane. So yes, it has C3H.

Triisopropyl borate's structure is trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes. Wait, no, the mirror planes would be present because each substituent is the same. Each mirror plane would pass through the central B and bisect two substituents. So that would give it C3H symmetry.

Wait, but wait, in the trigonal planar geometry, the point group is D3h, which includes more symmetry elements than C3H. So maybe triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry than C3H.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The answer is quinuclidine, option D.


To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒH symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **Câ‚ƒH symmetry** refers to a molecule having a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and three perpendicular two-fold axes (Câ‚‚), along with a horizontal mirror plane. This symmetry is characteristic of trigonal pyramidal structures, such as ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ).

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached. If the phenyl groups are positioned symmetrically at equivalent points on the trifuran core, the molecule could have a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ). However, the structure does not clearly indicate the presence of three perpendicular Câ‚‚ axes and a horizontal mirror plane, which are required for Câ‚ƒH symmetry. Thus, this option is unlikely to have Câ‚ƒH symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a benzo group (benzene ring) fused to a trifuran structure. The symmetry of this molecule is disrupted by the attachment of the benzo group, which breaks the equivalence of the substituents. As a result, the molecule does not have a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ) or the necessary mirror planes, making it unlikely to exhibit Câ‚ƒH symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar, with a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ). However, trigonal planar geometry lacks the required horizontal mirror plane and perpendicular Câ‚‚ axes, which are essential for Câ‚ƒH symmetry. Therefore, this molecule does not exhibit Câ‚ƒH symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a tricyclic structure. It has three equivalent bridges, which create a three-fold rotation axis (Câ‚ƒ). Additionally, each bridge is symmetric, providing three perpendicular Câ‚‚ axes and a horizontal mirror plane. This combination of symmetry elements satisfies the requirements for Câ‚ƒH symmetry, making quinuclidine the correct answer.

### Conclusion  
After analyzing the structures and symmetry elements of the given molecules, quinuclidine is the only option that exhibits **Câ‚ƒH symmetry**. 

Answer: D
