Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector and n is a unit vector. I remember that σ is composed of the Pauli matrices, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the dot product would involve each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n and then summed.

Wait, so the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because I remember that for each Pauli matrix, when you diagonalize them, the eigenvalues are ±1. Or is that when you multiply them by something else?

The Hamiltonian here is a product of ε and the dot product of σ and n. But since n is a unit vector, the sum of the squares of its components is 1. So maybe we can think of σ · n as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, but scaled in a particular way.

I think the eigenvalues of the matrix σ · n would be ±1 multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, but σ · n is a vector in the direction of n, so the matrix itself is... I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that any spin operator in the direction of n would have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 when it's the spin component, but wait, the spin operator is σ/2 multiplied by something else?

Wait, the spin angular momentum operator is usually (ℏ/2) σ, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ℏ/2, the eigenvalues become ±ℏ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n. So maybe the eigenvalues would be ±ε multiplied by something?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The operator σ · n itself, what is its trace and determinant? For any unit vector n, the matrix σ · n would be a traceless matrix because each Pauli matrix is traceless. The trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The determinant would be -1 because (σ · n)^2 is the identity matrix. Wait, let me check that. Because σ · n is a sum of Pauli matrices scaled by n's components. Each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix I, so (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i^2 term is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i. But σ_i and σ_j anticommute when i≠j, so σ_i σ_j = -σ_j σ_i. So the cross terms would be 2n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i)/2? Hmm, maybe I should recall that (σ ·n)^2 = I. Because, for any unit vector n, (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2) + terms involving σ_i σ_j. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2=1, and the cross terms (2n_i n_j (σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i)/2) would be something. Wait, perhaps it's better to just compute (σ ·n)^2. Let me compute it.

Each Pauli matrix σ_i squares to I. The cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i. For i≠j, but because σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k, so σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 0 because σ_i and σ_j anticommute. Because σ_i σ_j = -σ_j σ_i, so their sum is zero. So (σ ·n)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 0. Since σ_i^2 is I, this becomes (n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I = I, because n is a unit vector. So (σ ·n)^2 = I. So the eigenvalues of (σ ·n) must satisfy (λ)^2 =1, so λ=±1. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n are +1 and -1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is H=ε (σ ·n). So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n, which are ±1. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait—am I forgetting something? Like the units or the nature of ε? The question says ε is a constant with dimension of energy. So yes, that makes sense. So H has eigenvalues ± ε. So the answer must be option B.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we analyze the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are traceless, Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of these Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) must satisfy \((\lambda)^2 = 1\), so the eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\).

The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) scales these eigenvalues by the constant \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \(+1, -1\) — Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).  
**B)** \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) — Correct, as derived above.  
**C)** \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) — Incorrect, as there is no factor of \(\hbar/2\) in the eigenvalues.  
**D)** \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) — Incorrect, as these values are unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
