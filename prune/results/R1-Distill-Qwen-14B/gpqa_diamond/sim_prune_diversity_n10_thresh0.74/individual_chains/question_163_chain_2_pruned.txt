Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and figuring out the minimum volume of acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so when it's dissolved in an acid, it's going to react. The acid is monobasic and strong, which probably means it's something like HCl. Monobasic means it donates one H+ ion, right? So, the reaction should be between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid.

The reaction equation would be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Yeah, that makes sense. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would require 3 moles of H+ ions. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of HCl would give one H+.

Wait, but let me check the molarity. The acid is 0.1 M. So, the concentration is 0.1 mol per liter, which is 0.1 mol/dm³, same as 0.1 mol per 1000 cm³. But the volume we need is in cm³, so maybe keeping track in liters will help.

Now, the question is about 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The molecular weight of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait wait, wait a second. Wait, what's the formula for Fe(OH)3? Oh right, it's iron(III) hydroxide. So yeah, Fe(OH)3. So, molecular weight is correct.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g /
