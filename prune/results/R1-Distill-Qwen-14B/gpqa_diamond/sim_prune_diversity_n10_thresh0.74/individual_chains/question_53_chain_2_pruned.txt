Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters usually have a carbonyl (C=O) peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. So, that's an important clue. Esters are R-O-CO-O-R' or something, so maybe the substituents are ester groups or have an ester moiety.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two are aromatic-H, which suggests that the substituents might be in positions that give two distinct sets of aromatic protons. Wait, di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, para, meta, or ortho. Each affects the number of distinct aromatic protons. If it's para, there are two sets of H (each set with 2 H each). For meta, I think it's three sets, like each substituent causing different shifts. Ortho would have maybe three as well, but I'm not too sure. But since the NMR shows two aromatic signals, maybe it's para substitution. Because if it's para, the ring would have two equivalent H on each ortho position to the substituents. So two signals, each integrating for 2 H each.

Then, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those on a double bond, so maybe there's a substituent with a double bond, like an ester group attached via an ethylene group. The NMR description says one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm. A vinyl group adjacent to an ester might lead to coupling. For example, if there's an ethyl group attached to the ester, maybe the vinyl protons are next to that.

Wait, the vinyl-H signals: the first is a doublet, the second is a doublet of quartets. That pattern suggests that each vinyl proton is coupling with another proton. In a trans configuration, perhaps? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a substituent like CH₂CH₂-O-... No, wait, that might not be right.

Then, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So two sets of methyl groups. No signals for –CH₂ groups. So, the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH₂) groups. That suggests that any substituents with CH₂ might be in a configuration where those protons are either equivalent or absent. For example, in an ester group, maybe the substituents are methyl groups attached in a way that there's no CH₂.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but the substituents could be something like O-CO-O-R groups. Oh, wait, the substituents on the benzene are the ester groups. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else.

Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two groups attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent could be an ester group, but that might complicate
