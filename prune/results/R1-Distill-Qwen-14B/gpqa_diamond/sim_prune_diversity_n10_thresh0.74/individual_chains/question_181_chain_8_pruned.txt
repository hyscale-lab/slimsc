Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the neutrino flux in two energy bands after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the solar core is where most of the fusion happens. The proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and I think the pp-II and pp-III are less significant, maybe in different regions. Oh wait, pp-III might be the high-mass branch or something like that. But when it stops, what happens?

Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the Sun. The main source is the pp chain, which produces electron neutrinos. The pp-III branch probably contributes to the neutrino flux. If it stops, the flux from that source would drop. But how does this affect the different energy bands?

I think solar neutrinos have various energy distributions based on the reactions they come from. The pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, maybe around a few MeV, while other processes like the CNO cycle might produce higher energies. But wait, the CNO cycle is more prominent in the outer core, right?

Wait, when the pp-III branch stops, that means the production of neutrinos from that specific branch ceases. So the total neutrino flux from the Sun would decrease, but the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So I need to see how the pp-III branch contributes to these bands.

I think neutrinos from the pp chain (including its branches) have a broad spectrum, but they peak at lower energies. The pp-III branch might produce higher energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I. For example, if pp-III is a higher-energy process, then stopping it would reduce the flux in higher energy bands more than lower ones.

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the flux in higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would drop significantly, while the lower band (700-800) might still have contributions from other branches or processes.

Wait, but the pp chain is dominant in the core. The CNO cycle is more in the outer regions. So the neutrinos from the CNO would be higher energy. So if pp
