Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully.

The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in a three-dimensional space, I guess. And there's an observable represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0.

Hmm, right. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, so first I need to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible measurement outcomes. Then, I check if 0 is one of them. If it is, I find the eigenvector associated with 0 and compute the inner product with the given state vector. The probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.

Wait, but what's the matrix P exactly? Let me write it out.

P is a 3x3 matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So it's symmetric, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues are real.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let's see. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

Calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix might be a bit involved, but let's try.

Matrix P - λ I looks like:
[ -λ    1/√2     0 ]
[1/√2  -λ    1/√2 ]
[ 0     1/√2   -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row.

So:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] ) 
- (1/√2) * det( [ 1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] ) 
+ 0 * something.

So first term: -λ * [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = - (1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2) ] 
Which is - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2 ) = (1/√2)(λ/√2) ) = λ/(2)

Third term is zero.

So putting it all together:

det(P - λ I) = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2.

Let me write that as:

-λ^3 + (λ)(1/2) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ.

Set this equal to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1. The question asks about the probability of getting 0.

So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, then compute the inner product of the state vector with this eigenvector, square its magnitude, and that's the probability.

Let's find the eigenvector for λ=0.

The equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P|v> = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) ) =0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3=0 → same as first equation, so v2=0.

So from first equation, v2=0, from third, v3 = -v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as (v1, 0, -v1), where v1 is a free parameter.

We can choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we should normalize it.

The norm is sqrt( (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Alternatively, another way to write it is (1, 0
