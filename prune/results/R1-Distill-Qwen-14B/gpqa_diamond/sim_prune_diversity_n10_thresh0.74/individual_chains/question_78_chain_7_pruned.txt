Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to electric and magnetic fields, right? The question is asking for the correct expressions for V and A at a given time and position.

Wait, the setup: the charge q is moving along some trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r, which is the field point. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. And the velocity of the charge at time tr is v.

I think I should recall the retarded potentials. Oh right, retarded time is when the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, because the electromagnetic effects travel at the speed of light. So t > tr, meaning the observed time is after the event that caused the field.

Scalar potential V is usually related to the electric field. The scalar potential due to a charge at rest would be Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But since the charge is moving, there must be some correction. Oh wait, but wait—actually, for the scalar potential, when the charge is moving, the expression might involve the velocity somehow. Or is it just the same as static case? Maybe the scalar potential doesn't involve the motion directly, but the vector potential does. Because I remember that the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field, which arises due to moving charges.

Wait, in the context of potentials, the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (something), and the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * (some expression). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

The general formulas for retarded potentials are a bit involved. Let me think. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r) + ... )], but wait, I'm mixing up terms here. Alternatively, the exact expression might involve the term (d c - d · v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

Wait, the vector d is from the charge's position (at time tr) to r. So the distance between the charge and the observation point is d. So in terms of the denominator, it's probably (d c - d · v), but I'm not sure about the signs.

Let me think about the expressions. For the scalar potential, using the retarded time approach, it's something like V = q/(4πε₀ (d - (v t_r)/c^2 )) or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's (d c - v · d), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are built from the charge's motion. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t_r /c^2 )) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is d c - (v · d), where d is the vector from the charge to the observation point. Let me think about units too. The denominator should have units of length.

Looking at the options, option C and D have denominators involving dc ± (d · v). So the denominator is a scalar, like (d c - v·d). Since d and v are vectors, their dot product is a scalar.

Wait, the denominator should have the same units as d (length) multiplied by c (m/s) minus something, but wait, v is m/s and d is meters, so v · d would be (m/s)*(m) = m²/s. But c has units m/s. So dc is (m/s)*m = m²/s. So subtracting two terms that have m²/s is okay. So the denominator is (d c - v · d), which has units m²/s.

Wait, but the denominator is in the denominator of V, which should have units V·m = (N m²/C) = (kg m³/(C s²)),
