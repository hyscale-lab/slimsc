Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about an unknown white solid, and they've given some spectral data. I'll have to analyze each piece of data and see which option fits.

First, let's look at the molecular ion peak. The mass spec shows a peak at m/z 156 with 100%, meaning that's the molecular weight. Then there's another peak at 158, 32%. Hmm, the molecular weight is 156. So what could that be? Maybe something with a chlorine? Chlorine has a mass of about 35, but wait, let me think. 156 is the molecular weight, but 158 is 156 + 2, which suggests maybe there's a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes, about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion at 156 would be 35Cl, and 158 would be 37Cl. But wait, the molecular ion is 156, which suggests the molecular formula includes a Cl. Because 35Cl is 35, so if the molecular weight is 156, the formula might be something like C8H5ClO2? Or maybe C7H5ClO2? Let me think.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's compute its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl and a hydroxyl group. Let's see: Benzaldehyde is C7H7O (wait, no, benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO, which is C7H6O). So adding Cl and OH. So original formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me compute: 12*7 =84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl) =35.5, 16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89+35.5=124.5+32=156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is 156. Wait, maybe the formula's different. Or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the formula is C8H5ClO2, which would be 8*12=96 +5=101, 35.5=136.5, 16*2=32: 96+5=101, 101+35.5=136.5, 136.5+32=168.5. That's too high. Hmm.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, so C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5=35.5, 2*16=32. 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Hmm, again, same as option A. But the molecular ion is 156, which is even. So maybe the formula is C8H7ClO2? Wait, that's 8*12=96 +7=103 +35.5=138.5 +32=170.5. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't adding another oxygen. Let me think again. Maybe the molecular weight is 156. So, 156. Let's compute the possible formula. Let's say it
