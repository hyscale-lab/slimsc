Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is like breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is typically used for olefin metathesis, which can include ring-closing, ring-opening, and cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pentene is five carbons. 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a 3-methyl substituent. So the third carbon (from the double bond) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, that can't be right because pentane is five carbons. So the structure should be:

The main chain is five carbons, double bond at position 1 (between C1 and C2). So it's
