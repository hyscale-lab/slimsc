Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, first, let me make sense of what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when we titrate them, they'll neutralize each other to form acetate ions and water.

But before that, the initial dilution. The initial solution is 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Oh wait, because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant. So yeah, concentration becomes 0.025 M after dilution.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that more carefully. The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (in liters) multiplied by molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH. The question is about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

First, let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol (since 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The acetic acid solution after dilution is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Right, that's correct.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, how much volume of NaOH is needed to reach equivalence? Moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. So the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 1
