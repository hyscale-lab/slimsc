Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are related to the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics, especially in the context of partial waves.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh right, each δ_l corresponds to a partial wave with angular momentum l. So l starts at 0, then 1, 2, 3, 4... and so on. 

The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we only consider up to l=4 here. But wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all these partial waves. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, that's when θ=0, because the incident beam direction is straight ahead.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over l of (something with the phase shifts). Oh wait, the general formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) * (sin(lθ) / sinθ) ]

But wait, when θ approaches 0, the scattering angle is zero. So in the forward direction, sin(lθ) is approximately lθ, and sinθ is approximately θ, so the ratio (sin(lθ)/sinθ) becomes l. So the sum simplifies for small θ, like when θ=0.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. For the forward direction, maybe the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the sum of (something) involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the imaginary part of f(θ) is related to the total cross-section, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I remember that the total scattering cross-section is given by σ_total = 4π |f|^2, but that's when integrated over all solid angles. But here, the question is about the imaginary part at θ=0 specifically.

Wait no, wait. Let me think about the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude
