Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each offering a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence would give me the desired product with a high yield.

First, let me draw the structure of the target molecule. So, ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the benzene ring has a ketone group (COCH3) attached. But wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Wait, numbering the benzene ring: the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So, the substituents are meta to each other. Or wait, wait, no. Let me think: the benzene ring has three substituents—COCH3 (position 1), Br (position 3), and NO2 (position 5). So, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, does that make sense? Because benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 would be every other carbon. So that would place them in a sort of alternating positions.

Wait, but the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is attached to the phenyl group. So the phenyl group is at position 1 of the ketone. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the substituents on the benzene ring. Let me picture it: phenyl ring with COCH3 (from acetophenone) at position 1, Br at position 3, and NO2 at position 5. So, the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the ketone (CO-) attached to the benzene ring at carbon 1. Then, the substituents on the benzene are Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5 relative to the ketone group. So, the ring has three substituents: at positions 3 and 5 from the ketone (position 1), and the ketone itself is position 1. So, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, but 3 and 5 relative to 1 would be across the ring. Hmm, maybe it's easier to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has the ketone group, and then Br and NO2 groups in the meta positions relative to each other. So, the ketone is in position 1, Br is next at position 3, and NO2 at position 5. So all three substituents are in a meta arrangement. Wait, but wait, benzene can't have three substituents all in meta positions because that would require each substituent to be separated by two carbons, but with three substituents, that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho and para positions. Let me think again. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone at position 1 of the phenyl ring. Then, on the phenyl ring, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, for example, if the ketone is attached to C1, then the substituents are on C3 and C5. So that would make the substituents on adjacent carbons. Wait no, C3 is two positions away from C1, and C5 is four positions away, but in a six-membered ring, that's the same as two positions away in the opposite direction. Hmm, perhaps it's better to imagine building the molecule step by step.

The target molecule is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So, acetophenone has a benzene ring with a ketone group. Then, the ring has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. So, the ketone is in position 1, Br in position 3, and nitro in position 5. So, that would be like, the ketone is in position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2 is H, position 3 is Br, position 4 is H, position 5 is NO2, position 6 is H. So, the substituents are at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are para to each other? Or is that not possible? Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta to each other, and 3 and 5 are also meta. So, they're all meta to each other in a way, but it's possible.

So, the question is, how do we get from benzene to this compound via a series of reactions. I need to think about the order of reactions because the positions of substituents depend on the order in which they are introduced, especially when dealing with activating and deactivating groups, and whether the substituents are added as ortho/para directors or meta directors.

The target molecule has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. So, the question is the order in which these substituents are attached to the benzene ring.

The substituents' directing effects are important here:

- Nitro groups (NO2) are meta directors and deactivating.
- Bromine (Br) is ortho/para director but deactivating (because it's an electronegative atom).
- Acetophenone (COCH3) is a meta director and deactivating because the ketone group is electron-withdrawing.

Wait, but wait, when you have a meta-directing group, the incoming substituent will attach in the meta position relative to it. So, the order in which the groups are added will determine their positions.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps. To get the substituents in the correct positions, we need to plan the synthesis steps.

One approach is to first attach a group that will direct the next substituent into the correct position, then another group that directs the third substituent correctly.

Let's think about possible sequences.

Suppose we first introduce the nitro group. Nitro is a meta director. Then, perhaps we can introduce the bromine and the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps we introduce the ketone first.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director. So, if I first introduce the ketone group (COCH3), then the next substituent (say, the nitro group) would go into the meta position relative to COCH3.

Wait, but the target has both Br and nitro groups. Let me think.

Wait, let's outline the substituents: COCH3, Br, NO2. The target has them at positions 1, 3, and 5.

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce the ketone group (COCH3) first. Then, nitro and Br would be added in the correct positions.

But wait, if I add nitro next, it would be a meta director. So, where would the nitro group go? Let's say the benzene ring has COCH3 at position 1. The next substituent (nitro) would go into position 3 or 5, depending on the directing.

Wait, no, if the first substituent is COCH3 (meta director), then the next substituent (let's say nitro) would enter at positions 3 or 5 relative to COCH3. Then, when we add the Br, it would go into another position. Hmm, but in the target, Br is at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first add nitro, then COCH3, then Br. Or some other order.

Another approach is to consider the steps needed for each substituent.

Let me think about each substituent and how they are usually added.

Nitro groups can be introduced via nitration (HNO3 with H2SO4 as a catalyst). They are meta directors.

Bromine can be introduced via bromination with Br2 and FeBr3 as a catalyst. It's an ortho/para director but deactivates the ring.

The ketone group (COCH3) is usually introduced via acetylation of a phenol or via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation requires the ring to be activated, because it's an electrophilic substitution reaction. Benzene itself is not very reactive for Friedel-Crafts unless it's strongly activated. So, perhaps we can't directly acetylate benzene without an activating group.

Wait, so if I want to add the ketone via Friedel-Crafts acylation, I must have an activating group (like an -OH group) on the benzene ring. So, perhaps we first introduce an -OH group, then acetylate it.

Alternatively, maybe we can nitrate, then brominate, then acetylate.

Wait, but nitration and bromination are deactivating, so they make the ring less reactive toward Friedel-Crafts. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, another alternative: maybe introduce the ketone via a different method. Wait, perhaps via the benzoin condensation or something else, but I think Friedel-Crafts is the standard approach.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated, so perhaps the first step is to add an activating group, like a methyl group (but that's not the case here), or perhaps a nitro group can't be introduced first because it's deactivating. Hmm, no, wait, Friedel-Crafts won't work on deactivated rings.

Wait, so perhaps the ketone must be introduced after some activating groups. Alternatively, maybe we can add an -OCH3 group first, then acetylate.

Wait, but the target doesn't have an -OCH3 group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should map out the steps for each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A:
i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acetylation. But benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts without an activating group. So, this would not work. So, option A step i) would fail because benzene is not reactive enough. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B:
i) Br2/FeBr3 → adds Br to benzene. Then, HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Then, CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. But after adding Br and nitro groups, which are deactivating, can Friedel-Crafts acylation occur? Because the ring would be deactivated, possibly making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So, maybe this won't work.

Option C:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Then, Fe/HCl → this is for reducing nitro groups. Wait, if we have nitro group, then Fe/HCl would reduce it to NH2. Then, CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate the amine. Wait, but amines are strong activating groups. Acetylation of aniline would give acetanilide. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, let's think. If I nitrate benzene first, then reduce the nitro group to amino, then acetylate the amino group. That would give me acetanilide, but in the target, we have a nitro group. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me go through each option's steps.

Option D:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Then, Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2. Then, NaNO2/HCl → this is nitrous acid treatment, which typically converts amines to diazonium salts. Then, H3PO2 → this is for the Sandmeyer reaction, which typically replaces diazonium groups with other substituents, like Br in this case. Wait, but in this case, after getting the diazonium salt, H3PO2 (phosphorous acid) would replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group? Or wait, H3PO2 is used in the presence of HX (like HCl) to substitute with X. Or maybe in another way.

Alternatively, let's think:

Step i: Nitration → adds NO2.

Step ii: Reduce NO2 to NH2. So now, benzene has an amino group.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 → this would typically lead to substitution. But I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used in the hydrolysis of diazonium salts under different conditions. Wait, when you have a diazonium salt and treat it with H3PO2, it's usually for the Sandmeyer reaction, where you can substitute with Cl, Br, etc. But without a copper catalyst, perhaps it's just decomposition.

Wait, no. The Sandmeyer reaction typically uses CuCl or CuBr in the presence of HCl or KCl for substitution. Without that, perhaps H3PO2 is used in the presence of HCl for something else. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is a way to convert an amino group (after nitration and reduction) into a bromine substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Let me try to plan the synthesis steps. The target has three substituents: COCH3, Br, and NO2. I need to figure out the order in which these would be added to benzene to end up in the correct positions.

Optionally, perhaps I can first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, let's see:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene. This gives a meta-directing group.

2. Then brominate nitrobenzene. Since nitro is a meta director, the bromine would go into the meta position relative to nitro. So, nitro is at position 1, bromine would be at position 3.

3. Now, the ring has nitro and bromine. Now, I need to introduce the ketone group. But both nitro and bromine are deactivating groups, so the ring is less reactive. But Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activated ring, so maybe this won't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then nitro and bromine.

Wait, but benzene itself can't undergo Friedel-Crafts. So, perhaps we need to have an activating group first, like a methyl group. But the target doesn't have a methyl group; it has COCH3. So, perhaps a methyl group is added first, then converted into the ketone.

Wait, another approach: Maybe we can introduce the ketone via a side chain, like via toluene. Let me think: If I have toluene, I can acetylate the methyl group (using CH3COCl and AlCl3) to form acetophenone. But wait, no, toluene's methyl group is an activating group. So, Friedel-Crafts acylation would add the acetyl group at the ortho or para position relative to the methyl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit off track. Let me think again about the target. The target has all three substituents, so we have to add all three. The problem is the order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a directing group. For example, perhaps I first nitrate the ring, then introduce a group that can be converted into the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then a Br, and then the COCH3 group. But how?

Wait, let's think about the substituent directing. Let me outline substituents and their directing effects:

1. Nitro group (NO2): meta director, deactivating.

2. Bromine (Br): ortho/para director, deactivating.

3. COCH3 (keto group): meta director, deactivating.

So, if I have a benzene ring and add the first substituent, say, NO2. Then, when adding the second substituent, it will go meta to NO2.

Then, adding the third substituent will go meta to the second and perhaps ortho or para to the first.

Alternatively, perhaps I should plan the steps to place substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the ketone group (COCH3) as the first substituent. But wait, benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts without an activating group. So, maybe we have to add an activating group first.

Wait, that complicates things. Maybe we can add an -OH group first, then introduce the acetyl group. Then, nitrate and brominate.

Wait, but let's think: if we first introduce an -OH group (activating, ortho/para director), then acetylate it to become OAc (but that's not helpful). Alternatively, perhaps I can first nitrate, then introduce the acetyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let's think about each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino → aniline derivative.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization → diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → hydrolysis of diazonium salt? Maybe to form a phenol? Because treating a diazonium salt with H2O (with H3PO2 perhaps as an acid catalyst) gives phenol. But phenol is an activating group. So now, we have a phenol group.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate phenol. Since phenol is an activating, ortho/para director, Br would go ortho or para.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, with Br and phenol groups, but wait, if phenol is present, it's a strong activating group and would direct the acylation to ortho or para.

But wait, the target has Br and nitro groups. Wait, but in this sequence, nitro was reduced to amino, then converted to a phenol. So, the nitro group is now a hydroxyl group.

Hmm, but the target has nitro, so this approach would not result in that. So perhaps option D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to track each option's steps.

Looking again at the options:

Option C:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate the amino group → acetanilide.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Since acetanilide is a strong activating group (the NHCOCH3 group) and is a meta director? Wait, no, acetanilide is an activating group because the lone pairs from the amino group are available. Wait, no, in acetanilide, the NH is replaced by NHCOR, which is an activating group, but directs incoming substituents to meta positions. So, when we brominate acetanilide, Br would go into the meta position relative to the acetanilide group.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is present, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, reduction to amine, acetylation, bromination, etc., but I'm not sure.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → add Br to benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate the benzene. Now, the ring has Br and NO2. Since Br is ortho/para, and NO2 is meta.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate. But after adding Br and NO2, the ring is highly deactivating. Can Friedel-Crafts proceed under such conditions? I'm not sure. It's possible, but perhaps it's more difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts after activating the ring.

Wait, but benzene isn't activated. So perhaps we need to introduce a strong activating group first, like a methyl group, then acetylate, then nitrate and brominate.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a methyl group. So that approach may not work.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, and then the acetyl group.

But earlier I thought that after nitro and bromine, Friedel-Crafts would be difficult because the ring is deactivated.

Wait, but perhaps the positions are correct. Let me think:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Brominate nitrobenzene → since nitro is a meta director, bromine would enter at position 3 and 5. But wait, in nitrobenzene, the nitro group is at position 1. The next substituent (Br) would go into position 3 (meta) or position 5 (which is also meta). So, perhaps the Br would end up in position 3.

3. Now, the ring has nitro at 1 and Br at 3. Now, to introduce the ketone group (COCH3). Since the ring is strongly deactivated (both nitro and Br are deactivating), Friedel-Crafts may not work. So, perhaps an alternative approach is needed.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's steps again.

Option C:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce → amino group.

iii) Acetylate → acetanilide.

iv) Brominate → Br added to acetanilide.

v) Nitrate → another nitro group?

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So, this may not be the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option C are:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce → amino.

iii) Acetylate → acetanilide.

iv) Brominate → Br in meta to acetanilide.

v) Nitrate → but this would add another nitro group, which the target doesn't have.

Hmm, not matching.

Option B's steps:

i) Br → benzene becomes bromobenzene.

ii) Nitration → adds nitro group. Since Br is ortho/para director, the nitro could go into position 3 or 5 relative to Br.

Wait, but the target has nitro at 5 relative to the ketone (which is position 1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group.

2. Brominate → Br added in meta to nitro.

3. Introduce ketone group via Friedel-Crafts, but since the ring is deactivated, maybe this isn't possible. So, perhaps another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a directing group. For example, if I have a methyl group, I can acetylate it. But the target doesn't have a methyl, so maybe that's not the way.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the ketone group first (using Friedel-Crafts after activating the ring), but I'm not sure how to do that because benzene isn't reactive enough. So, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the amino group, then acetylate to form acetanilide, then nitrate and brominate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has a nitro group, so maybe the nitro is introduced after some steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Brominate → Br at position 3.

3. Introduce ketone group. But this is challenging because the ring is deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via another method, such as a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ketone is introduced via a benzyne intermediate. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first introduce the ketone as a substituent, but that requires an activating group first. So, perhaps:

1. First, introduce a hydroxyl group (phenol) via some method.

But wait, how would I introduce a hydroxyl group? Maybe through diazotization and hydrolysis. But benzene can't be directly converted into phenol unless via some special steps, like using a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to first nitrate, then brominate, then introduce the ketone via Friedel-Crafts, but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this by looking for the correct substituent positions.

The target has COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5.

So, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the benzene ring. That means that 1 is the ketone, 3 is Br, and 5 is NO2.

Now, considering the directing effects:

If I first introduce the nitro group, it's a meta director. Then, the next substituent (Br) would go into position 3, and then the ketone would go into position 5? No, wait.

Wait, no. Let's think of the order as:

1. Add nitro group → position 1.

2. Add Br → position 3.

3. Add ketone → position 5.

But the ring is already deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added first, then Br and NO2.

But then, after adding the ketone, which is a meta director, the next substituent would go into meta positions relative to it.

Wait, if I have COCH3 at position 1, adding NO2 would go into position 3 or 5. But then adding Br would go into position 5 or 3, depending on the directing.

Wait, let me think. COCH3 is a meta director. So, when adding NO2, it would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say it goes into position 3. Then, the Br, which is an ortho/para director, would go into position 5 relative to COCH3, or perhaps position 3 would be taken by NO2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider each substituent's effect.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

1. Introduce the nitro group first. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene. Now, position 1 has NO2.

2. Next, brominate nitrobenzene. Since NO2 is a meta director, bromine would be added in the meta position, which is position 3.

3. Now, the ring has NO2 at 1 and Br at 3. Now, we need to add the ketone at position 5. But the ring is highly deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative approach: Introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then Br.

But to introduce the ketone, I need an activating group. So perhaps:

1. Introduce a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts (but benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts without an activating group, so perhaps this isn't possible).

Wait, another idea: Maybe the ketone is introduced via a different method. For example, using a benzene ring that already has an activating group, like an -OCH3 group, which can be converted into the ketone.

So, steps could be:

1. Methoxy group introduced (e.g., via electrophilic substitution).

2. Acetophenone formed via acetylation of the methoxy group. But that would form an ester, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps via oxidation, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone via a different method, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitro, then ketone, then bromine.

Wait, let's try:

1. Nitrate benzene → NO2 at 1.

2. Acetylate → but how? The ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Unless another method is used.

Hmm, stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the bromine, then the nitro, then the ketone.

So:

1. Brominate benzene → Br at 1.

2. Nitrate bromobenzene → since Br is ortho/para, nitro would go into position 3 or 5.

3. Now, introduce the ketone. But again, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work.

Wait, but perhaps if the nitro group is at position 3, then the ketone can be introduced at position 5. But again, the ring is deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the ketone as an acetylation after activating the ring. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the ketone is introduced via a benzyne intermediate, which allows for meta substitution. But I think that's more advanced than what's needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then introduce the ketone via a different method, then brominate.

Wait, but without activating groups, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider the steps in option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro group.

ii) Reduce nitro to amino → NH2 group.

iii) Diazotize → form diazonium salt.

iv) Treat with H3PO2 → replace diazonium group with something. Wait, I think that H3PO2 in acidic conditions can lead to substitution with hydroxyl groups, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, treating with H3PO2 would replace the N2+ group with a hydroxyl group. So, the ring would have an -OH group.

v) Brominate → since -OH is a strong activating group (ortho/para director), Br would enter at position 3 or 5.

vi) Acetylate → now, -OH would direct the acetyl group to ortho or para positions.

Wait, let's see:

After step iv, the ring has an -OH group at position 1 (where nitro was).

Step v: brominate → Br at position 3 (ortho to -OH) or 5 (para). Let's say it's at position 3.

Step vi: acetylate → COCH3 would go ortho or para to -OH. So, if Br is at 3 (ortho to -OH), then COCH3 would go to position 5 (para to -OH) or position 2 (ortho), but position 2 is adjacent to Br.

Wait, but the target has COCH3 at position 1, which is where the -OH was. Hmm, but in this case, the -OH is at position 1.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the ring as follows:

After step iv, the ring has an -OH group at position 1.

Step v: brominate → Br could go to position 3 (ortho) or 5 (para) relative to -OH.

Assuming Br is at position 3.

Step vi: acetylate → the -OH directs to ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But the target has COCH3 at position 1, so that's where the -OH was. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro at position 1.

ii) Reduce nitro to amino → amino at position 1.

iii) Diazotize → form diazonium chloride at position 1.

iv) Treat with H3PO2 → this would hydrolyze the diazonium group, replacing it with -OH at position 1.

v) Brominate phenol → Br adds ortho or para to -OH. Let's say Br adds at position 3.

vi) Acetylate → the -OH group is at position 1, so the acetyl group (COCH3) would add at position 3 (ortho) or 4 (para). But position 3 is already taken by Br. So, the acetyl would go to position 4.

But the target has the ketone at position 1, which is where the -OH was. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Option B's steps:

i) Br added to benzene → Br at position 1.

ii) Nitrate → since Br is ortho/para, nitro could go to position 3 or 5.

Suppose nitro is at position 3.

iii) Acetylate → since Br is at 1 and nitro at 3, the ring is highly deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts may not work. Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is added at position 5 (meta to nitro).

But the target has the ketone at position 1, so this doesn't match.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the correct order based on the substituent positions.

The target has the ketone in position 1, Br in 3, and nitro in 5.

So, the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5.

Which means that when the ketone is added, it's in the position where the nitro and Br are in their respective positions.

Maybe the correct order is:

1. Introduce the nitro group at position 5.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because I can't change the position of the substituents once they're added.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the nitro group, then the bromine in the meta position, then the ketone in the para position relative to the nitro.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate, then introduce the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about which option's steps would result in the correct substituents in the correct positions.

Looking at option C:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → amino at 1.

iii) Acetylate → acetanilide (COCH3 at 1).

iv) Brominate → Br would go meta to acetanilide, which is at position 1. So, Br would go to position 3.

v) Nitrate → but the ring already has nitro at 1. Can't add another nitro. So, probably not.

Hmm.

Option B:

i) Br → position 1.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 3 (assuming ortho addition to Br).

iii) Acetylate → since Br is at 1 and nitro at 3, the acetyl group would go into position 5 (meta to nitro and para to Br).

Wait, but Br is an ortho/para director and nitro is a meta director. So, the acetyl might go into position 5, which is meta to nitro (position 3) and para to Br (position 1). So, that's possible.

So, the substituents would be:

- Br at 1.

- Nitro at 3.

- COCH3 at 5.

But the target has COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So, this doesn't match.

Hmm.

Option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce → amino at 1.

iii) Diazotize → N2+ at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → hydroxyl at 1.

v) Brominate → Br at 3 (ortho to OH).

vi) Acetylate → COCH3 at 3 (ortho to OH, but Br is already there) or 4 (para). Wait, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options are working, but I must choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C:

Looking at option C's steps:

i) Nitrate → NO2 at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Acetylate → COCH3 at 1 (since NH2 is a strong activating group, but it's being acetylated, which changes the directing).

Wait, when you acetylate aniline, you get acetanilide, which is a meta director. So, after acetylation, the acetanilide group is at position 1, which is a meta director.

iv) Brominate → Br would go into position 3 or 5 (meta to COCH3).

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, but after step iii, the ring has COCH3 at 1 and NH2 is gone. Then, step iv would add Br at position 3 (meta to COCH3).

Then, step v is another nitration. But the target only has one nitro group.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another approach: the target has NO2, Br, and COCH3. The order in which these are added must allow each substituent to be added in the correct position.

I think the correct order is:

1. Nitrate benzene → NO2 at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to NO2).

3. Introduce COCH3 → but how? The ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, perhaps this isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce COCH3 via Friedel-Crafts.

But benzene can't undergo Friedel-Crafts without an activating group. So, perhaps we can't do that.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the acetyl group is introduced via a different method, such as the benzoin condensation, but that typically involves two phenol groups.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → NO2 at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3.

3. Introduce COCH3 via some other method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, because in that case:

i) Nitrate → NO2.

ii) Reduce → NH2.

iii) Acetylate → COCH3 at 1.

iv) Brominate → Br at 3.

Then, the ring has COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 1. Wait, that's not correct because in step i, NO2 is at 1, and in step iii, COCH3 is also at 1. That's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm not interpreting the steps correctly. Let me think again.

Option C's steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → product is nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2 → product is aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate aniline → acetanilide (COCH3 at position 1).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate acetanilide. Since acetanilide is a meta director, Br would go into position 3.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate acetanilide bromide. Wait, but the ring already has a nitro group? No, in step i, we had nitro which was reduced to NH2, then acetylated. So, after step iii, the ring has COCH3 at 1.

In step iv, Br is added at position 3.

In step v, nitrate again. But the target only has one nitro group. So, maybe step v is adding another nitro group, which isn't desired. So, option C's steps may not result in the correct product.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. I'm not sure, but perhaps the correct option is option C. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: think about the order of substituents in the target. The target has the ketone (COCH3), Br, and NO2. 

If I first introduce the Br, then the NO2, then the ketone, perhaps the positions would work out.

So, steps:

1. Brominate benzene → Br at position 1.

2. Nitrate → since Br is ortho/para director, nitro could go to position 3 or 5.

3. Acetylate → since the ring has Br and NO2, which are deactivating, can Friedel-Crafts proceed? Unlikely, so maybe this isn't the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first introduce the Br, then the ketone, then the nitro. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D:

i) Nitrate → NO2 at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Diazotize → N2+ at 1.

iv) H3PO2 → OH at 1.

v) Brominate → Br at 3.

vi) Acetylate → COCH3 at 5 (para to OH).

But the target has COCH3 at 1, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. I think the correct option is option C, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because it introduces the substituents in a way that allows the nitro, Br, and ketone to be in the correct positions.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, option D's steps involve introducing the nitro, then converting it to OH, then brominating, then acetylating.

So, after step iv, the ring has OH at 1. Brominating would add Br at position 3. Then, acetylation would add COCH3 at position 5 (para to OH) or position 2 (ortho, but adjacent to Br). But the target has COCH3 at 1. So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the steps. Maybe in step vi of option D, the acetylation is done at position 1. But how? The OH is at 1. Friedel-Crafts would require an activating group, which OH is. So, COCH3 would go into ortho or para relative to OH. Ortho would be position 2, para position 4. So, that doesn't match the target.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is none of the above, but that's not possible. So I must choose between the given options.

After much consideration, I think the correct option is option C. Let me outline why.

Option C:

i) Nitrate → NO2 at 1.

ii) Reduce → NH2 at 1.

iii) Acetylate → COCH3 at 1.

iv) Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to COCH3).

v) Nitrate → ? But the target doesn't have another nitro group. So, perhaps step v is something else.

Wait, option C's step v is another nitration, which would add another nitro group, which the target doesn't have. So, that's not right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: the target has three substituents, so the steps must introduce all three.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Option B's steps:

i) Br added → Br at 1.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 3 (ortho to Br).

iii) Acetylate → COCH3 at 5 (meta to nitro).

So, substituents would be Br at 1, nitro at 3, COCH3 at 5.

But the target has COCH3 at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, that's not matching.

Hmm, I'm really confused. I think I'll go with option C, but I'm not confident.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: a ketone group (COCH3) at position 1, a bromine atom (Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (NO2) at position 5. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: This step involves Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce the ketone group. However, benzene cannot undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation directly because it is not sufficiently activated. This step would fail.
2. The subsequent steps involve nitration, bromination, and others, but since the first step fails, this option is invalid.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination of benzene introduces a bromine atom at position 1.
2. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of bromobenzene adds a nitro group at position 3 (ortho to Br) or 5 (para to Br).
3. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would introduce the ketone group. However, the ring is highly deactivated due to the presence of Br and NO2, making Friedel-Crafts acylation unlikely to proceed successfully.
4. The sequence does not lead to the correct substituent positions (COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5), and the acylation step is questionable due to the deactivated ring.

#### **Option C**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group converts it to an amino group (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Acetylation of the amino group forms acetanilide (COCH3 at position 1).
4. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination of acetanilide adds bromine at position 3 (meta to COCH3).
5. **HNO3/H2SO4**: A second nitration step would introduce another nitro group, but the target molecule has only one nitro group. This makes the sequence inconsistent with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of benzene introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group converts it to an amino group (-NH2) at position 1.
3. **NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
4. **H3PO2**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces it with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 1.
5. **Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination of phenol adds bromine at position 3 (ortho to -OH).
6. **CH3COCl/AlCl3**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group. However, the -OH group directs the acylation to positions 2 (ortho) or 4 (para), not position 1. This does not match the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly leads to the target molecule with the correct substituents (COCH3 at position 1, Br at 3, NO2 at 5). However, **Option C** comes closest, as it introduces the ketone group first and bromine in the correct position. The discrepancy lies in the second nitration step, which is unnecessary for the target molecule. Despite this, Option C is the most plausible among the given choices.

**Answer: C**
