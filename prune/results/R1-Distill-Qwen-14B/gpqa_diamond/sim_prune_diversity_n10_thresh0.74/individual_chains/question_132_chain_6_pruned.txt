Okay, so I've got this NMR question here. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Wait, so each compound is a tetramethylbenzene except for option C, which includes diethyl. Let me think about the structures. 

First, molecular formula C10H14. So for benzene rings, C6H6, plus four methyl groups (C4H12), that adds up to C10H16. Oh wait, but the formula is C10H14. Oh, wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyls would be C4H12. So total is C10H18? But the given formula is C10H14. Oh, wait, maybe one of the substituents is not a methyl. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options: All the first three options are tetramethylbenzenes (four methyl groups), but the last option in each pair varies. Wait no, the options are pairs, each in A, B, C, D is two compounds.

Wait the options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl

Wait, wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring. So that's C8H14? Let me calculate the molecular formula for each compound.

Let's take each option's compounds:

Option C has 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (four methyl groups) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (two ethyl groups).

Wait, for the first in option C: four methyl groups on benzene: C6H5(C4H12) → C10H14? Because benzene is C6H5- (assuming each substitution replaces a H), so each methyl is adding CH2? Wait, no: Each methyl is CH3—so for a benzene with four methyl groups, it's C6H5-CH3 four times. So the formula would be C6 + 4*(CH3) = C10, and H: each methyl adds 3 H, but the benzene originally has 5 H (since each substitution reduces by one H). Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substitution replaces one H. So
