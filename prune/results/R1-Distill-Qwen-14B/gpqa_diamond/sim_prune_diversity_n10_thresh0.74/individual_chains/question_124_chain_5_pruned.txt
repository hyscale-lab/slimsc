Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about particles moving in a detector and whether they reach the inner walls. Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, the Lorentz factor affects things like time dilation and length contraction. But how does that relate to the particles reaching the detector walls?

Alright, the problem says that particles are produced at the center of a spherical detector. Their average Lorentz factor is about 20, and on average, one third of them reach the inner walls. The radius is 30 meters. Now, we need to find the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of them to reach the walls.

Wait, so I think the key here is figuring out how the particles' speed affects whether they can reach the detector's edge before decaying. Because if they're moving faster, they can cover the distance more quickly, maybe reducing the time they have to decay. So, the particles that reach the walls are those that don't decay before traveling the detector's radius.

Oh right, the particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime is very short. The lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime (rest frame) is tau, and the dilated lifetime is gamma * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So, the distance they can travel before decaying is v * t, where t is the dilated lifetime. So, distance D = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance to the wall is the radius R = 30
