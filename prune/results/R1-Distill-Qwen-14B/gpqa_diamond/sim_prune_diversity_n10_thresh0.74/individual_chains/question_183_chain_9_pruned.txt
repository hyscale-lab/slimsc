Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is asking about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Hmm, okay, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, in this case, I think X and N are zero, so it's just (2C + 2 - H)/2. So I need to figure out the structure of the product first, and then calculate its degree of unsaturation.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclohexene ring. The numbering starts at the cyclohexene part. So:

- At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO).
- At position 5, there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH2 attached as a substituent.
- The cyclohexene ring itself has a double bond, which is at position 3. So the ring is cyclohex-3-ene.

Wait, the starting molecule is a cyclohexene with substituents. So it's a six-membered ring, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at carbon 2, a formyl group (CHO), and at carbon 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait. Vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the substituent at position 5 is a CH2CH2 group with a double bond? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure would be:

Ring positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Double bond is between 3 and 4. At position 2, a formyl (CHO) group. At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH- attached to the ring).

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the preparation of alkenes from alkynes, but that's maybe not applicable here. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkynes, but wait, another possibility: the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI is the phosphorus-halogen exchange. For example, in the presence of excess HI, alkenes can undergo addition reactions, but wait, maybe it's a dihydrohalogenation? Let me think.

Wait, I'm confusing a few reactions. Red phosphorus is often used in the presence of iodine for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that doesn't apply here. Alternatively, I think that when an
