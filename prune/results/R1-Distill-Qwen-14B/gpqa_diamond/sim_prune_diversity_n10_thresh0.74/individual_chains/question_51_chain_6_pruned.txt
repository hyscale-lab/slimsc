Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about the potential energy of a system where a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, there are some key concepts I need to apply.

So, the setup is a charge 'q' placed at a distance 'd' from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But since the conducting sphere is grounded, that might affect the charges present on it. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the earth, so any excess charge can flow into the ground. So initially, when the charge 'q' is placed near the sphere, the induced charges will adjust on the sphere.

But wait, is the sphere initially neutral? I think so, because it's just a conducting sphere unless stated otherwise. So when a positive charge q is placed near it, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. The sphere being a conductor means that the charges will move freely on its surface. So the charge 'q' will induce an opposite charge on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but because the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can actually leave the sphere. So the sphere won't just have an induced charge; any excess charge due to induction can go into the ground. Hmm, so maybe the sphere remains neutral but has induced charges on its surface which then cancel out because the
