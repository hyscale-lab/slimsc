Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Beta is 1/(kT), but I guess I don't need to worry about the actual values, just the exponents.

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, the total number of possible configurations is 2^3 = 8. So I need to list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each, then sum up the exponentials.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than brute-forcing all 8 cases. Let's see the energy expression. The energy depends on the sum of the products of each pair. So for each pair, if the spins are the same, their product is +1, and if different, -1.

Let me think about the possible cases based on how many pairs are aligned (i.e., same spin) versus anti-aligned.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the number of +1 and -1 spins. Because the energy depends on the interactions between all pairs, maybe the number of same pairs can be determined based on the number of same spins.

Wait, another approach: for each of the three pairs S1S2, S1S3, S2S3, each can contribute either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can range from -3 to +3. But wait, what are the possible values?

Let me think. The maximum possible sum would be 3 (all pairs aligned), the minimum would be -3 (all pairs anti-aligned). But wait, perhaps not all values are possible. Let's think in terms of how many pairs are aligned.

Wait, each pair can be either aligned (same spin) or anti-aligned (different). Let me consider how many pairs are aligned. Let's say m is the number of aligned pairs.

So m can be 0,1,2,3. Then the sum would be m*(1) + (3 - m)*(-1) = m - (3 - m) = 2m -3. Wait, no, wait, no—wait, the sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is either +1 (aligned) or -1 (anti-aligned). So the sum is the number of aligned pairs minus the number of anti-aligned pairs.

Wait, no, because for each term, aligned is +1, anti is -1. So the sum is (number of aligned pairs) × 1 + (number of anti-aligned pairs) × (-1) = (aligned - anti-aligned). But the total number of pairs is 3, so anti-aligned = 3 - aligned. So sum = aligned - (3 - aligned) = 2 aligned - 3.

So for each possible value of aligned (0 to 3), the sum would be:

aligned = 0 → sum = -3
aligned = 1 → sum = -1
aligned = 2 → sum = +1
aligned = 3 → sum = +3

So the energy E is given by E = -J * sum. So for each sum, E is:

sum = -3 → E = -J*(-3) = 3J
sum = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J
sum = +1 → E = -J*(1) = -J
sum = +3 → E = -J*(3) = -3J

So now, for each possible sum, we can calculate the energy and determine how many states correspond to that energy.

Wait, but the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(−β E). Alternatively, since the energies repeat for states with the same sum, we can group states with the same E and multiply by their degeneracy.

So the plan is:

1. For each possible sum (and thus E), find the number of states that give that sum.

2. For each such group, compute the contribution to Z: (number of states) × exp(−β E)

3. Sum all contributions.

So let's go through each possible sum and find how many states correspond to that sum.

Case 1: sum = +3 → E = -3J

When sum is +3, all three pairs are aligned. That implies all three spins are the same. So either all +1 or all -1.

So how many such states? Two: S1=S2=S3=+1, or S1=S2=S3=-1.

So the number of states for this case is 2.

Case 2: sum = +1 → E = -J

This occurs when aligned pairs are 2, which is when two pairs are aligned and one is not. Wait, wait, sum is +1 would mean 2 aligned and 1 anti-aligned?

Wait, let me recheck: sum = 2 * aligned -3. So sum = +1 → 2 aligned = 4 → aligned = 2. So yes, two aligned pairs and one anti-aligned.

So how many states correspond to having two aligned pairs and one anti-aligned?

Wait, but wait: in a system of three spins, how can two pairs be aligned and the third be anti-aligned?

Wait, let's think. Each pair is a pair of spins. For three spins S1, S2, S3, the pairs are (S1,S2), (S1,S3), (S2,S3). For two of these pairs to be aligned, and the third anti-aligned.

But wait, if two pairs are aligned, what does that imply about the third?

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin values. Let's say S1 and S2 are aligned, S1 and S3 are aligned. Then all three spins are the same. So the third pair (S2,S3) would also be aligned. So that can't happen. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps that's impossible. So if two pairs are aligned, then the third must also be aligned. So how can sum be +1?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe the sum can also be achieved in another way. Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect, and I should directly calculate the sum for each state.

Alternative approach: list all possible 8 states, compute the sum for each, and count how many times each sum occurs.

So the 8 possible states are:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 +1 +1 =3 → E = -3J
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → sum = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) =1 -1 -1= -1 → E= J
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 → sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) =-1 +1 -1= -1 → E= J
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 → sum = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1 → E= J
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 → sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) =-1 -1 +1 =-1 → E= J
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 → sum = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-
