Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetic construct and why the green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. 

Wait, bicistronic vectors have two ORFs in one construct. The way it's described, ligand is first, then receptor. So the first thing I'm thinking is about the expression of these proteins.

The ligand has a stop cassette with loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, when Cre is present, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

They used mCherry as a tag for the ligand and eGFP for the receptor. Then, they made a mouse model that's homozygous for this construct in a wildtype background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. 

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, I think. Cre would delete the lox sites, so the ligand and receptor would be expressed. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is a way to have internal ribosome entry site, allowing for expression in a different context perhaps.

But when they look at the offspring under a confocal, there's no green signal. So eGFP isn't being expressed, or the receptor isn't being expressed.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression of the proteins, not their function. Not sure yet.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor wasn't properly trafficked, you wouldn't see GFP in the cell, but maybe not. Also, if it's in the Golgi, you might see some processing but maybe not enough to show up in Western blot. But the Western blot didn't show the expected signals either.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. The vector uses CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. If the enhancer is missing, then maybe the ligand isn't expressed. But the receptors are under IRES, which is more about allowing for translation without a strong promoter, perhaps. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is supposed to drive expression in neural crest cells. If the promoter is missing, perhaps the ligand and receptor aren't expressed in the right place.

Wait, but the vector has the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES. So maybe the CBA is sufficient for expression, but without the right enhancer, perhaps the expression isn't high enough. Alternatively, in the absence of Cre, the constructs are silenced because of the stop cassettes. But in the mice that are homozygous, and they crossed to SOX10-Cre, so Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, deleting the stop cassettes. So the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

After transfection to primary astrocyte culture, they did a Western blot. But in the question, the Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading. Hmm, maybe they didn't see the tagged proteins. But the question says that after transfection, they used the antibodies. Oh, but after that, they made a mouse model. So perhaps the Western in the question was an initial test, but the mouse model didn't work.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct in wt background. Then they crossed to SOX10-Cre. So the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the offspring, no green signal. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the vectors: the ligand is first, followed by a stop cassette, then the receptor. Wait, no, the vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one mRNA? Or two separate? Wait, bicistronic vectors typically have two cistrons (ORFs) in the same transcript, separated by an IRES or a
