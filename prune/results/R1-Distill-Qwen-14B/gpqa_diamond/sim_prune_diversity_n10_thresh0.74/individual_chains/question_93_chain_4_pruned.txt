Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which is perfect because that means each cycle doubles the target. The R² is 1, so the curve fits perfectly, meaning the data points align well with the expected curve. The slope was -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope expected in a qPCR calibration curve?

I remember that the slope is related to the efficiency. The formula I think is slope = log(e) / log(10), but wait, maybe it's slope = log(e) * (ln(10)), no, wait, perhaps I should think about the standard qPCR formula. The standard curve method uses the equation: Ct = slope * log(concentration) + intercept. The slope is usually around -3.32 if the efficiency is 100% (because E=1, so log10(E)=0, but wait, maybe it's ln(E)/ln(10) for the slope? Let me think. Oh, right, the standard equation is based on the formula log10(N) = (slope * Ct) + intercept, but wait, correction: the formula is Ct = (log10(initial copies) * slope) + intercept. Hmm.

Wait, the efficiency formula is Ct = Ct0 + (log10(initial copies) ) / (slope), or something like that. Alternatively, the standard method uses a linear regression where the equation is log10(Q) = slope * Ct + intercept. No, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the standard curve method uses the equation: Ct = (log10(Q) ) * (1 / efficiency slope term) + something. Oh, right, the efficiency is used in the slope. So for efficiency E, which is 1 in this case (100%), the slope is usually around -3.32 because the formula is slope = log10(E) * (ln(10)) or something else? Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, I think the ideal slope for a qPCR standard curve when efficiency is 100% is -3.32. Because the equation is based on the formula Ct = (log10(initial copies)) * (slope) + intercept. So when efficiency is 100%, the slope is approximately -3.32. Oh, wait, in this case, the slope is -3.3, which is close to -3.32, so that's correct.

So the R² of 1 means a perfect fit. All the points lie exactly on the line, so the standard curve is ideal. Now, looking at the data, each concentration is diluted tenfold. The concentrations are 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10 copies per microliter. Each is a tenfold decrease.

The Ct values for each concentration: 33.9, 3
