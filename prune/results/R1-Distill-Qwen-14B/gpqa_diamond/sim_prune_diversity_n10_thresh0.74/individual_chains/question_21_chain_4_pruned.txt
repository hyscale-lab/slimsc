Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are constitutional isomers, whereas stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements. Then it poses two specific questions (A and B) about which compounds show certain properties.

The first part (A) asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a neighboring atom between two positions, resulting in a different structure. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, this isn't possible because they don't have adjacent hydrogens. Wait, no, wait: wait, tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen and a shift in double bonds, like in enols and ketones. So, for a compound to show tautomerism, it must have at least one alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).

Benzoquinone is a dihydroxybenzene with two ketone groups, I think. Wait, no, wait: benzoquinone has two ketone groups in a benzene ring, right? Because quinones have two carbonyl groups. So if it's benzoquinone, it's something like O=C6H4=C=O. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone usually has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So in the case of para-benzoquinone, it's O=C6H4=O. So the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at opposite positions. Now, the carbonyl groups are on the ring. So, do the carbonyl carbons have any adjacent hydrogens? Let's think: the carbonyl is C=O, so the adjacent carbons (the ones attached to the ring) would have hydrogens if the ring is fully hydrogenated. Wait, no, in benzene, each carbon is bonded to a hydrogen except where substituents are. But benzoquinone's structure is a benzene ring where two of the carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. So those carbons
