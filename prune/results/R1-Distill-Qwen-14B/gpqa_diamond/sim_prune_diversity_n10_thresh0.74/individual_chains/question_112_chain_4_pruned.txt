Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Pauli z matrix. But wait, the question is asking about another operator whose matrix elements Aij are given as hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm. So I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator A, and also compute the average value of A.

Wait, first, I should probably write down what operator A looks like. The matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin-½ particles), the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Oh, right! Because when i≠j, it's hbar/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. That looks familiar; I think that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, A is (hbar/2) * X.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's X. Alternatively, maybe it's another operator. But regardless, to find the eigenstates of A, I can find the eigenstates of this matrix. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to note that the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix since A is a scalar multiple of X.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Because the Pauli X operator flips the spin in the x-direction.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), since the eigenvalues of X are 1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate when the state is |alpha>. But wait, the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so I need to normalize it first, right?

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I need to compute the normalization factor. Let me denote |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the inner product of alpha with itself.

So the inner product is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². Wait, 1² + 1² is 2.

Wait, no, 1+i is 1 + i, so real part 1, imaginary part 1. So |1+i|² = 1^2 +1^2=2.

Similarly, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

So now, |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2}.

So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Let me write |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x> + any other terms? No, because it's a two-level system.

So let's compute c1 and c2.

Express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>

Where a =
