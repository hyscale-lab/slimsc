Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation. 

So, let's start by reading the problem again. The nucleus has a mass M and is initially at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. 

Wait, the sum of rest masses is 99% of M? That's interesting. Because in fission, usually, the total mass might decrease due to energy being released, but here they're saying the rest masses add up to 99% of the initial. So maybe there's some binding energy involved, but I'm not sure yet. 

The problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Let's call the two fragments A and B. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m. Then the heavier would be 2m. So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So, M is the initial mass. Therefore, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So fragment A is 2m = 0.66 M, fragment B is m = 0.33 M.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if the heavier is 2 times the lighter. So I'll let the lighter be mass m, heavier is 2m. Their sum is 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, momentum of fragment A equals the negative of fragment B's momentum. Let's denote their velocities as v_A and v_B. Since momentum p = gamma m v, but wait, do I need to consider relativistic effects here?

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So the approach is to first calculate T1 classically, then calculate correctly relativistically, then find the difference.

But wait, the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation." So the correct T1 is relativistic, and the classical T1 is non-relativistic. Then find the difference.

Wait, let me think. In non-relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But in the relativistic case, it's (gamma -1) m c². But since the fragments are moving, we'll have
