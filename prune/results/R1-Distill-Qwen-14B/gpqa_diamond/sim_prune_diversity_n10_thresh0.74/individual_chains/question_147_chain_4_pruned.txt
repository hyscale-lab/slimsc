Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into four particles, two positively charged A and two negatively charged A. Interesting.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are given in terms of c, which makes sense because we're probably dealing with relativistic speeds here.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, right, that probably means its speed is much less than the speed of light. So maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic methods? Or perhaps not, since the resulting particles might be moving at relativistic speeds.

But wait, the antiproton is slow, but the proton and antiproton are probably annihilating each other. So their rest frame would play a role here. Hmm, but wait, in the lab frame, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, but maybe in the center-of-momentum frame, things would be symmetric.

Wait, maybe I should think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their rest masses are the same, right? The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton is the same. So the total rest mass energy is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. But wait, when they annihilate, they produce four particles of mass mA c² = 300 MeV each.

Wait, no, each A has mass 300 MeV/c². So each A is much lighter than the proton and antiproton. Because 300 MeV is less than 938 MeV. So the mass of A is lower.

So the initial rest mass energy is 2 * m_p c² = 1876 MeV. The final mass energy is 4 * m_A c² = 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Hmm, that's a big difference. So the initial particles have more rest mass than the final. So what's happening here? Oh, because the initial particles are annihilating, so their rest mass energy is converted into kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum
