Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is an alkene because the formula for alkenes is CnH2n. For n=3, that's C3H6. So possible structures are propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6 too. Oh wait, wait—no, cyclopropane is C3H6. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So, which one is it? The next reaction is bromination in CCl4. That makes me think about addition reactions. If it's an alkene, it would undergo bromination via an addition reaction, probably adding Br across the double bond. If it's cyclopropane, bromination in CCl4 might not add—it depends. Alternatively, another possibility is that A is propene.

So, assuming A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), bromination in CCl4 would be an addition reaction. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, bromination of propene adds Br2 across the double bond. So the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Or maybe the bromide adds to the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane. I think
