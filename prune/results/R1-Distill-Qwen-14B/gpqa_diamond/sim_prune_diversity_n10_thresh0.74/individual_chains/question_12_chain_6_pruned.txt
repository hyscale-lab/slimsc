Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics yet. But let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is initially at rest, and I need to calculate the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, right. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That makes sense.

So, the pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, but what about the neutrino? Oh, neutrinos are super light. I think in these calculations, sometimes the rest mass of the neutrino is considered negligible, especially compared to the other particles' masses. So I'll probably treat it as massless here.

Let me jot down what I know:
- Mass of pion (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mass of muon (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Mass of neutrino (m_nu) ≈ 0 MeV/c² (since it's much smaller)

The pion is at rest, so its initial energy is just its rest energy: E_pi = m_pi c². Since c² is a constant, but in particle physics units, c is often set to 1, so E_pi = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy must be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So, E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

But wait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy is just its momentum times c (or in units where c=1, E_nu = |p_nu|). Similarly, the muon's energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

Wait, but since pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, |p_mu| =
