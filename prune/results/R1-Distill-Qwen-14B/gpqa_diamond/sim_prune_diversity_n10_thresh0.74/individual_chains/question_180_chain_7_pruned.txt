Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of particles with charge. Alright, let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has charge 2 times that. And they have negligible mass, so maybe I don't need to worry about their motion affecting much else.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P. Hmm, so they're arranged in some way around point P, perhaps like a sphere? Not sure if the arrangement matters, but maybe because the potential energy between charges depends on the distances between them.

Wait, the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So I'm guessing this refers to the potential energy, because in an isolated system, the energy would be conserved. But since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, maybe the potential energy is what's being considered here.

So, the system is isolated, so no work is being done by the outside, right? But the question is about the minimum energy. So maybe it's the minimum potential energy configuration. But wait, since the system's configuration can't change because the 12 charges are constrained, perhaps the energy is fixed. Or maybe
