Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in that product. The options are from A to D, with numbers 4 to 10. Hmm.

First, let me parse the starting material and each reaction step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo structures have bridgeheads, and the numbering is based on the parent structure. So this molecule has a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7 of the bicyclo system. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? So the structure is norbornene with some substituents.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction because we have dienes reacting. Wait, but the starting material is a diene? Let me think. The starting molecule, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, has two double bonds? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene.

Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, which has one double bond. But the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So there are two double bonds? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the name is hepta-2,5-diene, which implies two double bonds at positions 2 and 5? Or is it a conjugated diene? Wait no, hepta-2,5-diene would be two double bonds, but in a norbornene structure, that might not be possible. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a single conjugated diene, but maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene, and the other reagent is a dienophile. Because the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, so maybe this is the dienophile?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Diels-Alder reaction typically involves a diene and a dienophile. The diene is the conjugated diene (four pi electrons) and the dienophile is something with two pi electrons, like a ketone, ester, or a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups.

In this case, the starting molecule is a bicyclo with a diene (hepta-2,5-diene), so maybe that's acting as the diene. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. But
