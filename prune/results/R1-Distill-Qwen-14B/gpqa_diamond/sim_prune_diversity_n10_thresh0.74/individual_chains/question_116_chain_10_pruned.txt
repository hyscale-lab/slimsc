Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it and break it down.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each has three neighbors.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. That adds up to 10H. Hmm, maybe it's a structure with two sets of equivalent protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a methyl group (CH3) attached to something. Because 0.9 is a typical region for methyl groups attached to something like CH2 or maybe a CH with branching.

Wait, 6H as a triplet suggests two equivalent methyl groups, each with three protons, and each adjacent to a CH2. Because each methyl group's protons are split by neighboring CH2 protons. So if each CH3 is next to a CH2, their protons would be a triplet. Because each CH3 proton sees the two protons on the adjacent CH2. But wait, if it's a triplet, each set of H's is split by two neighboring H's. So maybe the CH3 is next to a CH2, which itself is connected to another CH3. Oh wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H triplet comes from two sets of three equivalent protons each. Like two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that would have more than two signals. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted ethane or something more symmetrical.

Wait, another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each of these protons is adjacent to three others. So what structure has four equivalent protons that are next to three others? Maybe a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups. Wait, but four protons as a quartet. Let me think: If you have a CH2 group that's between two other
