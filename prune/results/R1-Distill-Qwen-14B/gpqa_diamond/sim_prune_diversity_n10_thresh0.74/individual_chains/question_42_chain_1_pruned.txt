Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But maybe that's not crucial for the solution.

The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and their masses, and asks about the ratio of their orbital periods. The albedo for all three is the same, 0.3, like Earth's. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula I think is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ d²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. Since all have the same albedo, the ratio of their temperatures relates to the square root of the inverse of their distances.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(d²))^½. But L is the star's luminosity, which is the same for all planets since they orbit the same star. So T is proportional to sqrt(1/d²) which is 1/d. So T1/T2 = d2/d1. Or wait, wait, let me get that right. Because T is proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), right? Because it's T = (L(1-a)/(16πσ d²))^(1/4). So, the fourth root of L/(d²) times (1-a). So, T is proportional to (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d).

So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (T1)/(T2) = 1.4 = (sqrt(d2/d1)). Wait, no, wait. Because T ∝ 1/√d. So T1 = k/√d1, T2 = k/√d2. So T1/T2 = (√d2)/(√d1) = sqrt(d2/d1). So 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1). Squaring both sides, (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, the ratio of T2 and T3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring, d3/d2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So d3 =5.29 * d2. But since d2 is 1.96 * d1, then d3 is 5.29 * 1.96 * d1. Let me calculate that, 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that: 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684, so total around 10.3684. So d3 ≈10.3684 *d1.

Wait, but wait, because the ratios are Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3. So the ratio T1/T2 is 1.4, which implies d2 is about 1.96 times d1. Then T2/T3 is 2.3, so T2 is 2.3 times higher than T3. So since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), then sqrt(d3/d2) = T2/T3. So sqrt(d3/d2) =2.3 → d3/d2 = (2.3)^2=5.29 → d3=5.29 d2. So d3=5.29 *1.96 d1 = let's compute 5.29 *1.96. Let me do 5*1.96=9.8, 0.29 *1.96= approx 0.5684, total 10.3684. So d3≈10.3684 d1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into play here. I remember that the orbital period P is related to the radius of the orbit (distance from star) by the formula P² ∝ d³ / M, where M is the mass of the star. Or wait, no, Kepler's third law in the context of planets orbiting a star is P² = (4π²/G(Mstar)) * d³. So if Mstar is much larger than the planet masses, which I think it is, then the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So for the purpose of this problem, the period depends on (d)^(3/2) divided by the square root of the star's mass, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, the ratio of periods will depend on d^(3/2). So, P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2). Because P² ∝ d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

Wait, let me recheck that. If P² = (4π²/(G M)) d³, then P is proportional to d^(3/2) multiplied by 1/sqrt(M). But since M is the same for all, the ratio P3/P1 is (
