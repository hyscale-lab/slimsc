Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, spin-1/2 particles are like electrons or something similar, right? And the well has length L. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Wait, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh, and in the question, they define E as pi² ħ² / (2mL²), so E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²) times 1. So each energy level can be written as E_n = n² * E. So for n=1, E_1 = E; n=2, E_2=4E, etc.

But wait, this is for a single particle. Now we have four identical spin-1/2 particles in the same well. Since they are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a one-dimensional well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states, up and down.

So each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, you can have two fermions with the same n, but different spins. So first, let's think about how the particles fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would be the lowest possible energy, so we start filling the lowest levels. Each level can hold two particles. So for four particles:

- The first two particles go into n=1, each with opposite spins. So that's two particles in n=1.

- The next two go into n=2. Each with opposite spins as well. So 2 particles in n=2.

Wait, but if each level can hold two, then n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two, making four. So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1E) + 2*(4
