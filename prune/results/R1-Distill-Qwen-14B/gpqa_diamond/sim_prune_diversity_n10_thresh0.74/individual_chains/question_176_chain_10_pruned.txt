Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in a system. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, no, waitâ€”the state is a vector, right? So it's a column vector with those elements. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because usually, quantum states are represented as unit vectors. Let me check: the state vector given is [-1, 2, 1]^T. To find its magnitude squared, I'll compute the sum of squares of its components. So (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, so it's not normalized. That's something to note because when dealing with quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, meaning their magnitude squared is 1. So maybe I should normalize it first before proceeding.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention normalization. Hmm, but maybe the given state is correct as is, and perhaps the measurements are done without normalization? Or perhaps I should proceed assuming it's given like that. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think: in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. Otherwise, the probabilities don't add up to 1. So perhaps the given state is already normalized? Wait, 1+4+
