Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. But I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, right, so I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider the neutralization reactions. But wait, since we're mixing three solutions, the first step is probably to find out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions contributed by each solution.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll find the moles for each component.

1. **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid):** It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, when mixed with a strong base, some of it might react. But in this case, we're adding HCl (a strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (a strong base). So maybe the first thing to do is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see if they neutralize each other.

Wait, but I think I should calculate the moles contributed by each solution first.

Starting with CH3COOH:
Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L
Molarity = 0.1 M
Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it donates H+ ions. But since it's weak, it won't donate all of its H+. But when mixed with other acids and bases, maybe we can consider the net H+ or OH-.

Next, HCl:
Volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L
Molarity = 0.2 M
Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. So moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08.

Then, Ba(OH)2:
Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L
Molarity = 0.3 M
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So, let's tally up the moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ comes from HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH. Wait, but wait,
