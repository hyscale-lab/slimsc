Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through glass, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question says. 

The problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium—the glass—is moving relative to the observer. So I think I need to consider the effects of relative velocity here. 

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is not simply additive with the medium's velocity, right? Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics. But wait, this problem might not be considering relativity because the speed of light is always c in a vacuum. Or does it?

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass. So the glass is moving, but the light is already in the glass. Hmm. Oh, but the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed of the light?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. Because in the medium, the speed is lower. Now, the glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame. So we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame. 

But how do I combine these velocities? I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but that's when you're transforming between frames moving relative to each other. So the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame. Or wait, no: the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So perhaps I should treat it as a Lorentz transformation problem.

Wait, but wait. The light is in the glass, so in the glass frame, its speed is c/n. But light's speed in any frame is always c in vacuum. Hmm, but wait, in the glass medium, the speed is lower. So how does that work?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light is moving through the glass. So the speed of the light in
