Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The Mott-Gurney equation is used to describe the dark current in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited current (SCLC) conditions. I remember that in the SCLC regime, the electric field is so strong that the space charge (the charge accumulated due to current flow) creates a region where the electric field is modified. This equation comes into play when the current is limited by the space charge itself, rather than by other factors like carrier generation or recombination.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V^2)/(L^3). Let me break down the variables:

- J: Current density
- ε: Dielectric constant of the material
- μ: Carrier mobility
- V: Applied voltage
- L: Length of the device (like, say, the thickness in a diode)

So, the equation relates the current to the square of the voltage. I think this is a classic result from the theory of SCLC, which is also sometimes called the Mott's law.

Now, the question is asking which statement correctly describes the conditions under which this equation is valid.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each talks about different device conditions: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic vs Schottky contacts, presence of injection barriers, and whether drift or diffusion currents are negligible.

I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation applies to a single-carrier device. If it's a two-carrier device (like a bipolar junction transistor where both electrons and holes contribute), the behavior would be different because of the two different carrier types. So any option with two carriers is probably incorrect. Looking at the options, D talks about a two-carrier device. So probably D is not the correct statement.

Next, the equation assumes that the space charge is the dominant factor, so other effects should be negligible. The derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation involves the assumption that the current is limited by space charge, which implies that the carrier density is high enough that the space charge creates a significant electric field. So, I think this requires that the contact isn't so good that other current mechanisms (like Ohmic conduction) dominate. But what kind of contacts are we talking about here?

Ohmic contacts allow carriers to inject with low voltage barriers, whereas Schottky contacts have a potential barrier that some carriers can't overcome. But in the case of SCLC, the device is operated at a voltage such that the space charge is dominant, so maybe the contact type doesn't matter as much as whether the current is limited by other factors.

Wait, but I think for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold, the device must not have any significant series resistance or contact barriers, because if there were injection barriers, the current wouldn't be determined by the space charge but by the injection. Oh right, because if there's a barrier, like in a Schottky contact, the current is limited by how much carriers can tunnel or thermally inject. If that's the case, then the equation might not apply because the current isn't space-charge limited anymore.

So the condition would require that the contact is Ohmic, so that there's no significant barrier preventing carriers from entering. That way, all the applied voltage contributes to the space charge effect. So, any option that says 'Ohmic contact' might be a better fit.

Wait, let me think again. Ohmic contacts have zero barrier, so carriers can flow without any significant voltage drop at the contact. If the contact were Schottky, you have a barrier, so you might have a different current behavior, like in the case of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling or something else.

Now, looking at the options. Option A says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, and negligible drift current. Hmm, but wait, the equation accounts for drift current because it's based on the idea that carriers are being drifted by the electric field. If drifts were negligible, maybe the equation wouldn't hold. Or perhaps the equation assumes that diffusive effects are negligible and drift is dominant. Wait, in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, so perhaps the drift is the main transport mechanism, and diffusion is considered negligible. Or the other way around.

Wait, in the derivation, the Mott-Gurney equation comes from considering the movement of carriers under an electric field, which leads to drift current. But if there's a lot of trap-induced scattering, then mobility would be affected, so the equation assumes that the carriers move freely (trap-free). So the device must be trap-free.

So, the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device. So that narrows it down to options A, B, or C.

Now, each of these options has different conditions about the contacts and the type of current.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would imply an Ohmic contact (since a Schottky is a barrier). So if there's no injection barrier, the contacts are Ohmic. Ohmic contacts would mean that the voltage is applied without much drop at the contact, so the entire voltage contributes to the space charge.

In the Mott-Gurney equation, the assumption is that the current is limited by the space charge, which requires that the device doesn't have any significant series resistances or barriers that would limit the current before the space charge effect becomes dominant.

So, if there's an Ohmic contact, the voltage is applied across the semiconductor. If there's a Schottky contact, then you might have a higher voltage needed to get injection, which would mean that the space charge might not build up as expected, because the current is limited by injection, not space charge. So Mott-Gurney wouldn't apply in that case.

So the device must have an Ohmic contact (so option B is talking about no injection barrier, which is the same as Ohmic contact).

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current.

Option A: Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. If drift is negligible, then maybe the current is dominated by diffusion, which doesn't fit with the SCLC scenario because SCLC is about drift. So if drift current is negligible, the Mott-Gurney equation may not hold.

Wait, no. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is due to drift. Because in SCLC, the current is limited by the space charge, which affects the drift velocity. So if drift were negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So the correct condition is that diffusion is negligible, and drift is dominant.

Wait, in the derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation, the space charge is built up such that the electric field is so strong that the carriers are being accelerated, leading to drift current. So the assumption is that the current is due to drift, and that the space charge affects the electric field, not due to diffusion.

So for the equation to hold, the dominant current mechanism must be drift, not diffusion. So which options talk about that?

Looking again at the options:

Option B: negligible diffusion current.

Option A: negligible drift current.

Wait, which one is correct. If drift is the main current mechanism, then we need negligible diffusion. So the condition for Mott-Gurney would be that diffusion is negligible, so that drift dominates.

So the equation is valid when the current is primarily due to drift, meaning that diffusion is not significant. So the description should have negligible diffusion current.

So looking at the options, option B says negligible diffusion current.

So option B is: trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion.

Option A: Ohmic contact but negligible drift current. If drift is negligible, then the current couldn't be SCLC because the equation is based on drift.

So the correct statement would be option B.

Wait, but let me check what each option says.

Option B: 'no carrier injection barrier' implies an Ohmic contact, which aligns with Mott-Gurney. 'negligible diffusion current' implies that the dominant current is drift, which is correct.

So putting it all together: the correct conditions are a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current. So the equation holds under these conditions.

Looking back, option B says 'no carrier injection barrier' and 'negligible diffusion current'. So that must be the right answer.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current density \( J \) in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited current (SCLC) conditions. The equation is valid under specific assumptions about the device and operating conditions. Here's the analysis of the options provided:

1. **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation relies on drift current being the dominant mechanism, as the space charge modifies the electric field and accelerates carriers. If drift current were negligible, the equation would not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (implying an Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation, as it assumes drift dominates the current and diffusion is negligible. The absence of a carrier injection barrier ensures that the entire voltage contributes to the space charge, making this option correct.

3. **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a potential barrier, which can limit carrier injection and alter the current behavior. This contradicts the assumption of negligible injection barriers required for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold. Thus, this option is incorrect.

4. **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, as the presence of two carriers (e.g., electrons and holes) would lead to a more complex current behavior. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

In conclusion, the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This is accurately described by **Option B**.
