Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants plays a role in determining renormalizability. Let me think step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. So this looks like an interaction term between a fermion current and the electromagnetic field. Wait, no, maybe it's a different gauge field? Or perhaps this is a different kind of interaction, like maybe a spinor current interacting with a photon or some other gauge boson.

But regardless, the main question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. So I need to find [κ]_M and then see if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I'll recall that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension of fields and coupling constants can be calculated based on the terms in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian density, must be dimensionless (it's the exponent in the path integral and has to have no dimensions for the exponential to make sense).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because in 4D, the Lagrangian density has dimensions [Mass]^4. Wait, yes, because the integral is over 4 spacetime dimensions, each with [Mass]^{-1} (since x has [Mass]^{-1} because [Energy] = [Mass], and in natural units, x~ 1/Energy). So the Lagrangian density, which is integrated over d^4x, must have [Mass]^4 so that the integral (which gives dimensionless action) makes sense.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have [term] = 4.

Let me break down the given term:

L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each part contributes to the mass dimension. Let's think about the fields involved.

First, ψ is a Dirac
