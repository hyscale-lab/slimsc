Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the potentials in an electromagnetic field generated by a moving charge. Hmm, I remember potentials are scalar and vector quantities related to electric and magnetic fields. Let's see...

The question gives me a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. At time tr, the charge's velocity is v.

I need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, we're looking at potentials at a later time than when the field was generated.

Wait, I think the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. Retarded time, that's the time when the field was actually generated, because the effects travel at the speed of light. So, for a charge moving, the potentials at a later time would depend on where the charge was earlier.

The scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but for a moving charge, it's modified. Oh right, the scalar potential V at a point r and time t is (q/(4πε₀)) times 1 divided by something involving the distance. Wait, but moving charges might have a different expression because of the retarded time.

Wait, the general expressions for the potentials in the retarded time formalism... The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r' - (v' (t - t_r))| ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, it's simpler when considering the potentials as functions of the retarded time.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) / (d), where d is the distance from the charge's position at the retarded time to the point r. But wait, I'm forgetting the exact expression.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are determined by the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(c² τ)), where τ is the proper time? Or is it directly the distance? Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, I remember the Liénard equations for potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r' - r + (v' (t - t_r))/c²| ), and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q/(4π)) (v'/(c²)) * (1/(|r - r'|)) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions given in the options. Let's look at option C and D, which have terms like (d c - d · v), and option A and B are simpler.

Option A: V is Coulomb's law, and A is (v²/c²) V. That seems off because A is usually proportional to velocity, not velocity squared.

Option B: V is Coulomb, and A is v/(c²) times V. That might make sense dimensionally. Let
