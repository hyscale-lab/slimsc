Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. But what about their symmetries?

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think all theories in high energy physics must respect Lorentz symmetry because they're relativistic. So SMEFT operators must be Lorentz invariant. That makes sense. So option 1 is definitely correct.

Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry too. So option 2 should also be correct. Wait, wait, but wait. When you have higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect Poincare? Because higher-dimension ops are suppressed by the cutoff scale. But I think SMEFT is still a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars and hence Poincare as well. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Next, CP symmetry. I'm not so sure about this. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, especially due to things like the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, can the operators violate CP? Or does SMEFT require all operators to preserve CP? I think SMEFT allows for operators that can break CP. For example, operators that change the strong CP might be present if the model allows it. So I don't think all operators must respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Then, CPT symmetry. I remember that all Lorentz invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because the CPT theorem says that any quantum field theory which is Lorentz invariant must have CPT symmetry. So since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but wait. Are there any cases where an effective theory might not respect CPT? Hmm, maybe if the theory is not Lorentz-invariant, but since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, yes, CPT must hold. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT
