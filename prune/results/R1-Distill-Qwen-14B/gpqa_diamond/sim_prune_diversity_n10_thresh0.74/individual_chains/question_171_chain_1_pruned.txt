Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution usually happens on aromatic rings, and the substituents on the ring can direct where the substitution occursâ€”ortho, meta, or para.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when each of these six compounds undergoes a bromination reaction with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing para-isomer yield.

So the compounds are:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyl ethyl ester)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no, wait. Let me recount. The second one is C6H5-COOC2H5, so that's a benzoyl ester group. The fifth is C6H5-C2H5, which is ethylbenzene. The sixth is benzoic acid, which is C6H5-COOH.

I remember that substituents on benzene can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite.

So, meta directors are groups that are deactivating. For example, nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta-directing. Cl is slightly deactivating but ortho/para-directing because it's an electron-withdrawing group but also has lone pairs which can donate electron density through resonance. Wait, no, Cl is ortho/para because it's a halide. Oh wait, Cl is a meta director? Or ortho/para?

Wait, no. Let's think again. Halogens are a bit tricky. They are deactivating due to their electronegativity (withdrawing electrons via inductive effect), but they also have lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making the ring slightly activated in certain positions. So, halogens are ortho/para directors but deactivating. So, for chlorobenzene (compound 3), substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions.

Now, nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So compound 4, nitrobenzene, when brominated, the bromine will add para to the nitro group? Wait, no. Wait, nitro is a meta director. So the incoming Br would go meta to the nitro group.

Wait, but in nitrobenzene, bromine substitution occurs predominantly in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So the major product is meta-bromonitrobenzene.

Then, groups like COOH (compound 6, benzoic acid) are strong deactivating and meta-directing. Because the COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, it deactivates the ring, making the ring less reactive. So the incoming Br would go meta to the COOH group.

Similarly, COOEt (compound 2), the ester group. Ester groups are also electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl). But wait, esters are usually meta directors. So when you have a benzoyl ester attached, like in compound 2, the substituent is an ester group, which is deactivating and meta-directing.

Then, for the methyl group (compound 1, toluene), the methyl is an activating group. It's an electron-donating group (because it's an alkyl group), so it makes the ring more reactive. And it's an ortho/para director. So bromination would occur at ortho and para positions, but since the ring is activated, the reaction is easier.

Similarly, ethyl group (compound 5
