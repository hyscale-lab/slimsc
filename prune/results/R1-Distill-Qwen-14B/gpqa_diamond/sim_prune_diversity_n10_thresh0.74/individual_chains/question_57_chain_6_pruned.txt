Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, and tells me to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. The phase shifts are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. The electrons are 50 MeV, and the target is nuclear. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (exp(iδ_l) - 1) * (2l +1) * Pl(cosθ), where the sum is over all the angular momentum states l. And k is the wave number.

But wait, what's the imaginary part of f along the beam direction? Oh, the beam direction is θ=0°, so cosθ=1. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me write down the formula again. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l of (1/(2ik)) (exp(iδ_l) -1) (2l+1) Pl(1). Because Pl(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because Pl(x) is the Legendre polynomial, and when x=1, Pl(1) equals 1 for any l.

So the formula simplifies to f(θ=0) = sum over l ( (exp(iδ_l) - 1) * (2l+1) ) / (2ik)

But wait, wait. The imaginary part of f would be the imaginary part of that sum. So we can compute each term's imaginary part and sum them.

Let me think about each term. Each term in the sum is (exp(iδ_l) - 1) * (2l +1). Let's break that down. Expanding exp(iδ) is cosδ + i sinδ. So exp(iδ) -1 = (cosδ -1) + i sinδ. So when we take the imaginary part of this, it's sinδ.

So the imaginary part of each term (exp(iδ
