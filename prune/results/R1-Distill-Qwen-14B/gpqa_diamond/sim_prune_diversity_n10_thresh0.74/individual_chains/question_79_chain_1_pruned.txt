Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves an experiment where compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. They give me the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product, and I have to identify what compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Wait, no, actually, that's not right. Oh wait, no, it's used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Or wait, maybe it's used in the epoxidation of alkenes? No, wait, I think it's a catalyst for certain reactions. Oh wait, wait, another thought. Oh, maybe it's involved in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the Sharpless epoxidation? But no, Sharpless uses different reagents. Alternatively, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is called DBU, but actually, DBU is 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene, right? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, could it be a base used in some reaction? Hmm.

Wait, the reaction conditions: nonpolar solvent and 403 K (which is about 130°C). Hmm, that's a high temperature. So maybe a thermal reaction, like an elimination or a ring-opening... Or perhaps the formation of an epoxide from a diene? Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, could it be a Dieckmann cyclization? But that usually forms a six-membered ring using an ester.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the NMR data of the product. Let me parse the 1H and 13C NMR.

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't have neighboring hydrogens. Maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring, but methyl groups on aromatic rings are usually around 2.3 or so. Wait, but in some cases, like a CH3 attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N, the shift can be higher. Or maybe it's attached to something like an epoxide.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet, another methyl group. Maybe two methyl groups in the molecule.

Then, the aromatic region:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, that's four peaks in the aromatic region. Let me count the integrals. So 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6H. But wait, the compound X is C11H12O. The product's formula must be similar since it's the product of an reaction, but I need to check that.

Wait, the molecular formula of the product: the product would have the same number of carbons as the starting material, unless there's a rearrangement or some addition. Let me think about the options. The options are all epoxide-related compounds, perhaps. Let me see.

The 13C NMR:

- δ 21.3 (s, 1C): that's a very low shift, maybe a methyl attached to something like an oxygen, but wait, methyl attached to an epoxide ring would be around 20-30 perhaps. 21.3 is quite low, but maybe a CH3 attached to an oxygen, like OCH3? No, OCH3 is usually around 50-60 in 13C NMR. Hmm, so maybe a CH3 attached to an aromatic ring? Or perhaps a CH3 attached to an epoxide ring.

Wait, another 13C peak at 28.4 (s, 1C). That's more like a CH2 or CH group. Hmm, but it's a singlet, which suggests that the carbon is not attached to any other carbons that would cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe a CH3 in a different environment, but I'm not sure.

Then, the rest are aromatic carbons. Let's look:

126.9 (2C, s): two carbons at the same shift. 127.1 (1C, s): another, 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), and then 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s). Higher shifts like 140+ are typically carbons attached to electronegative atoms, like oxygen (epoxide carbons) or carbonyls.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 (1C, s). 197 is a very high shift; that's indicative of a carbonyl group, specifically an epoxide's carbonyl? Wait, no. Wait, epoxide is an ether, with two adjacent oxygen atoms. Wait, no, epoxide is a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms? No, an epoxide is an oxygen in a three-membered ring. The carbons adjacent to the oxygen in an epoxide would typically be around 55-70 ppm. Wait, but wait, 197 is much higher. So, that's probably a ketone or an ester carbonyl.

Wait, but the product should be from the reaction of compound X with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Let me think: what kind of reactions involve this reagent. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, which is sometimes used to deprotonate compounds, but more importantly, it's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. Wait, no, no. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a catalyst in the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids, but that's not right because peracids are the oxidizing agents. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is involved in the acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide. Or maybe, it's used in the formation of an epoxide via some other mechanism. But I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination to form an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, the product's molecular formula. Let's compute the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is C11H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a double bond or a ring. So, (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C11H12O: (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So six degrees of unsaturation. So that could be a benzene ring (3), one epoxide (which is a three-membered ring, so
