Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given as A to D. Hmm, I remember that [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, no, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of (nX/nY) divided by (nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_sun )

Wait, let me make sure. So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_☉ ). So if [X/Y] is positive, that means X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The problem gives me the following data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → Wait, wait, that seems negative. Let me compute that: 7.5 -12 is -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → which is about 3.16e-5. Wait, but that's the log10 of (nFe/nH) equals to -4.5?

Wait, no. Let me think. The formula given is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) → which is about 3.16e-5. So [Fe/H] for the Sun would be log10(nFe/nH / (nFe/nH)_sun) → but wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] would be zero because it's the reference. So for other stars, [Fe/H] is their abundance relative to the Sun.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The notation [X/Y] is defined as log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, right? So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY) / (nX/nY)_sun )

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - [X/Y]_sun, but since [X/Y]_sun is zero. Wait, no. Because the Sun's [X/Y] is log( (nX/nY)_sun /
