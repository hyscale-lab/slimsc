Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the structure. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene ring (since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring) with two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because the benzene ring has 6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the benzene ring itself is 6 carbons, and the substituents add two more, so the total is 8. So each substituent is probably a single carbon, but wait, maybe not. Let me think: di-substituted, so two substituents. So two substituents, each could be one or more carbons.

But the IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like a halide attached to the ring). So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halide. But wait, aromatic-halogen bond would be a halogen attached directly to the ring, right? Like Cl, Br, etc. So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl), and the other is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but wait. The carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) would be part of another substituent. So the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (like Cl) and something else with a carbonyl. So, for example, maybe a substituent is -COOR (like an ester, which has a carbonyl), and the other is -Cl.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the structure. Di-substituted benzene with two substituents: one is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. So possible substituents:

- One is -Cl, the other is something like -COCH3 (an acetyl group), but that's two substituents, each
