Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the interaction of magnetic fields with atomic orbitals, especially involving the magnetic quantum numbers. 

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so maybe m is 0 or 1 or something like that. 

I think the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy shift caused by the magnetic field. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom, given by the wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. 

Wait, what's the formula for the paramagnetic term? I think it's something like H' = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Oh right, the magnetic moment μ for an orbital is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So the energy shift would be proportional to m*B. 

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Oh right, the Zeeman effect comes into play here. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H' = (μ_0/(4π)) * (g * μ_B * m) * B, where g is the Landé g-factor and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. 

Wait, let me get the equations right. The energy shift due to the magnetic field (the paramagnetic term) would be ΔE_para = μ_B * m * B * something. Oh, wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), right? So μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. 

And the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength λ. The energy ΔE is related to the wavelength by ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute that. 

Given λ=0.4861 micrometers, that's 486.1 nanometers. So in meters, it's 486.1e-9 m. 

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. So hc is about 1.986e-25 J·m. 

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) ≈ Let me calculate that. Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 m is 1.9878e-25 /4.861e-7 ≈ 4.085e-19 J. 

Wait, wait, no. Because hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. Oh wait, that's a quicker way to compute it. So 1240 eV·nm divided by 486.1 nm gives approximately 2.547 eV. Then converting eV to Joules: 2.547 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 4.077e-19 J. So yeah, same as before. 

So ΔE is about 4e-19 J. 

Now the paramagnetic
