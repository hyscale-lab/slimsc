Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on both standard and chiral HPLC columns. The options are about how many peaks each HPLC would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation adds an epoxide group across a double bond. Oh wait, and when a double bond has E or Z configuration, the epoxidation can lead to different products, maybe diastereomers or something else.

Wait, for each reaction, one equivalent of mCPBA. So each alkene is epoxidized. Then aqueous acid is added. Oh, right! In acidic conditions, epoxides can undergo ring-opening reactions. So what happens when an epoxide is treated with acid?

The acid would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens. For a symmetric epoxide, maybe the ring opening isn't a big deal, but the starting alkenes here are (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. When each is epoxidized, what happens?

Epoxidation of a trans double bond would form a trans epoxide? Or does it form a specific stereochemistry? Wait, I think when mCPBA reacts with a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be trans, and for (Z), it would be cis.

Wait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think. Epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. So for a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Or wait, no, perhaps the epoxide forms with the same geometry. Wait, perhaps for (E), the substituents on either end are opposite, so the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms added across in a way that the substituents on each carbon are on the same face. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxidation doesn't change the stereochemistry but forms the epoxide in a certain configuration. Wait, I think that the epoxide retains the stereochemistry of the double bond. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be trans, with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Similarly, (Z) would form a cis epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this. Let's imagine oct-4-ene as CH2CH2 groups on either side. For the E isomer, the substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3 maybe?) on each end would be opposite each other. When epoxidized, the oxygen atoms would be added across the double bond. So, for (E), the resulting epoxide would have the two oxygen in a trans configuration, meaning the two new groups are on opposite sides.

But when you epoxidize, the addition of the oxygen is in a certain way. Oh, right, mCPBA adds an oxygen from the same face. So for a trans double bond, adding the oxygen from the same face would lead to the epoxide having a certain stereochemistry. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms
