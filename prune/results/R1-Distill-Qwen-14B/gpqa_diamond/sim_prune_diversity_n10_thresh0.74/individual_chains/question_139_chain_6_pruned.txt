Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that two compounds A and B are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid are often involved in diazotization reactions, especially with amines. Wait, but wait, the products are diketones. Oh! Diazotization usually leads to substitution reactions, but how does that form ketones?

Oh wait, I think I remember something about the Beckmann rearrangement. The Beckmann rearrangement involves the reaction of a diazonium salt with a proton source, like water. Diazonium salts from hydroxylamine can rearrange to form amides or ketones. Wait, no, the Beckmann is specifically for hydroxylamine derivatives.

Wait, let me think. When a hydroxylamine (like a secondary amine) is treated with nitrous acid (from HCl and NaNO2), it forms a diazonium compound. Then, under acidic conditions, this can undergo a rearrangement. For Beckmann, that's when the diazonium salt is formed from an oxime (a compound with a C=N-O group), and when it rearranges, it forms a ketone or an amide, depending on the structure.

So the general process is: R-NH2 (secondary amine) → R-N=N+ → under acid and water, rearrange to form a ketone or another structure. Oh wait, no, oximes are R-N-O-CR', right? So when you treat an oxime with nitrous acid, the Beckmann rearrangement happens, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe I should restructure this. The reaction conditions given (HCl, NaNO2, H2O) are typically used for the formation of diazonium salts from aromatic amines, but in this case, the products are diketones, which are non-aromatic. So perhaps the starting materials are diols or other compounds that can form oximes upon reaction with hydroxylamine.

Wait, no, the reactants are A and B, and the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. So, perhaps the starting materials are primary or secondary alcohols that can
