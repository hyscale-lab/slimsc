Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure out. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is like a CH2OH. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2) group? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-, but attached at the 2 position. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually an isopropenyl group. So it's CH2=C(CH2) attached to the cyclohexane ring. So the substituent is like a CH2-C=CH2 group, right?

So the starting molecule has a ketone group, a hydroxymethyl, and an isopropenyl group.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, so it's often used for deprotonation. Where are the acidic protons in the starting molecule? Well, the hydroxymethyl group has an -OH, which is acidic. But wait, the ketone is also alpha to the carbonyl, so maybe the alpha hydrogens are acidic too. In cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6. But in this case, the starting compound has substituents at 3 and 5. Hmm.

Wait, when you have a ketone like cyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens are on carbons 2 and 6. So the starting molecule's structure is such that the hydroxymethyl is at C3 and the isopropenyl at C5. So the ketone is at C1, so the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. So sodium hydride would deprotonate an alpha position. But wait, the compound also has an -OH group (hydroxymethyl), which is a stronger acid than the alpha hydrogens (since -OH is more acidic than aliphatic alcohols, but wait, no. Wait, the pKa of a ketone's alpha H is around 19-20, while the pKa of an -OH group is around 16-18 for an alcohol. Wait, but the hydroxymethyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to the ketone. So maybe that makes the alpha H more acidic? Or maybe the O-H is more acidic and gets deprotonated first.

Wait, sodium hydride is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the most acidic proton available. The hydroxymethyl group's -OH is more acidic than the alpha hydrogens of the ketone. Because the alpha H in the ketone is around pKa 20, while the -OH would be around 10 or so. So sodium hydride will deprotonate the -OH group, turning it into an alkoxide.

Once deprotonated, the next step is treatment with benzyl bromide. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so this is an alkylation reaction. The alkoxide will attack the benzyl bromide, which is a good electrophile. So the oxygen from the hydroxymethyl will become connected to the benzyl group.

Wait, but wait. The starting molecule had a hydroxymethyl group at C3. So after deprotonation, the O- would attack the benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br), replacing Br- and attaching the benzyl group to the oxygen. So the product would have a benzyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl oxygen. So the structure becomes 3-(benzyloxy)methyl cyclohexanone with the isopropenyl group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Deprotonate the -OH to form an O- which then attacks benzyl bromide, giving a benzyl ether. So instead of a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), it becomes a benzyl (CH2OCH2Ph). So the product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxy)methylcyclohexan-1-one, 5-isopropenyl.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are at 3 and 5. So product 1 is 3-(benzyloxy)methyl and 5-isopropenyl cyclohexanone.

Next step: product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence
