Okay, let's tackle this physics problem step by step. Hmm, it's about nuclear fission and relativistic vs classical calculations. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. Therefore, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. But since they have different masses, their velocities will be different.

So first, let's figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.

Substituting m1 as 2m2 gives 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. Then m1 = 0.66 M. Wait, wait, wait, 0.99 M divided by 3 is 0.33 M each for m2, but m1 is twice that, so 0.66 M? Wait, 0.33 * 2 is 0.66, and 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, which matches. So that's correct.

But wait, the initial mass is M, but the sum of the fragments is 0.99 M. So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So when it splits, the rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. The remaining 3 GeV must be the binding energy, which is converted into kinetic energy and any other forms like neutrinos or photons, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe we're considering only the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but in nuclear fission, the binding energy (which is the energy holding the nucleus together) is released. So when it splits, the rest mass of the fragments is less than the original, which makes sense here because 0.99 M is less than M. So the mass difference is M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So the rest mass energy lost is 0.01 M c², which is 3 GeV (since M c² is 300 GeV). So that energy is converted into kinetic energy and other forms, but the problem says to ignore electrons, so maybe we can assume all that energy goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Let's denote that as T1. The other fragment's kinetic energy is T2. So the total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. But wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal and opposite.

Let me model this. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Since momentum is m v, and since the fragments have masses m1 and m2, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2

Because they're moving in opposite directions, but the magnitudes are equal. So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2

But since m1 = 2 m2,

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 => 2 v1 = v2.

Wait, but wait, that's if the momentum magnitudes are equal. So m1 v1 = m2 v2 in magnitude. So solving for v2 gives v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

Since m1 is twice m2, v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write in terms of momentum. Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum of m1 as p, then the momentum of m2 is p in the opposite direction. So,

p = m1 v1

p = m2 v2

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

So v2 = (2 m2 / m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1.

But this seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps using conservation of energy and momentum.

The initial energy is just the rest mass energy, which is 300 GeV. The final energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies.

So,

Total energy after = (m1 c² + T1) + (m2 c² + T2)

And this should equal the initial energy, which is M c² = 300 GeV.

But wait, wait. The initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is M c².

After fission, the two fragments have rest energies plus kinetic energies. So:

m1 c² + T1 + m2 c² + T2 = M c².

But we know that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c².

So,

0.99 M c² + (T1 + T2) = M c².

Which implies T1 + T2 = M c² - 0.99 M c² = 0.01 M c² = 3 GeV. Because M c² is 300 GeV.

So total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But since the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, which is the kinetic energy of m1.

Wait, so how to find T1 and T2.

But we also have conservation of momentum. The total momentum after is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other.

So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 (but in opposite directions, so signs are opposite; the magnitudes are equal.)

So,

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1 / m2) v1.

Since m1 is twice m2, v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, but that would mean the lighter fragment is moving faster? Because m1 is larger, so v2 is larger. So the lighter fragment has a higher speed.

Hmm. But perhaps I should use relativistic equations because the kinetic energies might be significant.

But the problem is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So perhaps I need to compute both and find the difference.

Wait, but let's think about the non-relativistic case first.

In the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So let's model that.

From conservation of momentum:

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

Since m1 = 2 m2, v2 = 2 v1.

Now, the kinetic energies are T1 = (1/2) m1 v1², T2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

We also have T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Substituting v2 = 2 v1 into T2:

T2 = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 *4 v1² = 2 m2 v1².

So T1 + T2 = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + 2 m2 v1².

Wait, m1 is 2 m2, so T1 = (1/2)(2 m2) v1^2 = m2 v1².

So T1 + T2 = m2 v1^2 + 2 m2 v1^2 = 3 m2 v1^2.

And this equals 3 GeV.

So 3 m2 v1² =3 GeV → m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is (M/3) *0.99? Wait, no. Wait earlier, we had m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M. Or wait, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M; m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

So m2 = 0.33 M.

So substituting m2 =0.33 M, we have 0.33 M * v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me check the units. Because GeV is energy, which is (mass) * (velocity)^2, since E= (1/2) m v^2.

So let me compute v1^2:

v1^2 = (1 GeV) / (0.33 M )

But M c² is 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c².

So let me substitute M = 300 GeV/(c²) into the equation.

v1^2 = (1 GeV) / (0.33 * (300 GeV / c²) )

= (1 GeV) / (99 GeV / c² )

= (1 /99) c².

So v1^2 = (1/99) c².

So v1 = c * sqrt(1/99) ≈ c * 0.1.

Wait, sqrt(1/99) is about 1/9.949 ≈ 0.1. So v1 is about 0.1 c.

Similarly, v2 = 2 v1 → 0.2 c.

But these are non-relativistic speeds, but wait, 0.2 c is about 60 million meters per second. That's pretty high; relativistic effects might be significant.

But in the non-relativistic approximation, we just proceed.

So T1 = (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2) (0.66 M) v1².

We know that m2 v1^2 = 1 GeV.

m2 =0.33 M. So 0.33 M v1^2 =1 GeV → M v1^2 = 1 /0.33 ≈3.03 GeV.

So T1 = 0.5 * 0.66 M v1^2 = 0.5 * 0.66 * (3.03 GeV) ≈ 0.5 * 2 GeV ≈ 1 GeV.

Wait, let me calculate that again. Because M v1^2 is 3.03 GeV.

So T1 = 0.5 * 0.66 * 3.03 GeV.

0.66 *3.03 ≈2.0.

So 0.5 * 2.0 ≈1.0 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = 2 m2 v1^2 = 2 *0.33 M v1^2. Since m2 v1^2 is1 GeV, T2= 2*1= 2 GeV.

Wait, but T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, which matches. So in the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV.

But wait, this is the non-relativistic approximation. But the actual T1 is going to be relativistic because the fragments might have significant velocities.

Wait, but wait, the non-relativistic approximation might not hold if the velocities are significant fractions of c. For v ≈ 0.1 c, relativistic effects are noticeable, but perhaps the kinetic energy isn't too off. Hmm.

But the problem is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation. So I need to calculate T1 correctly using special relativity and then subtract the non-relativistic T1 of 1 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, T1 is 1 GeV. But the correct relativistic T1 is different.

So let's find the correct T1.

In the relativistic case, the total energy of each fragment is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

But let me recall that in relativity, the total energy is gamma * m c², and the momentum is gamma m v.

But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the momenta of the two fragments must cancel each other. So, |p1| = |p2|.

So,

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2,

and p1 = - p2.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

We also have that in the center of mass frame, the velocities are related. But maybe it's better to use energy and momentum conservation.

So, let me write the equations.

Conservation of energy:

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c².

Conservation of momentum:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the fragments move in opposite directions, their velocities are in opposite directions. So perhaps it's better to write the magnitudes as equal.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

We know that m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But we also have that the kinetic energy is T = (gamma -1) m c².

Our goal is to find T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

So, let's denote:

gamma1 = (total energy of m1) / (m1 c²)

Similarly, gamma2 = (total energy of m2) / (m2 c² )

So,

gamma1 m1 c² + gamma2 m2 c² = M c².

Dividing both sides by c²,

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = M.

We can write this as:

gamma1 (2 m2) + gamma2 m2 = M.

But m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, so 2 m2 + m2= 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1=0.66 M.

So substituting m1 = 0.66 M:

gamma1 (0.66 M) + gamma2 (0.33 M) = M.

Divide both sides by M:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

And from the momentum equation:

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Hmm, but we need more relations. Let's think about the relation between velocities and gamma factors.

In relativity, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

And v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Alternatively, we can write v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2 )

Hmm, perhaps we can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2 using the momentum equation and the velocity relation.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Let me think if there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express v2 in terms of v1.

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since m1 = 2 m2,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

So,

v2 = (2 gamma1 / gamma2) v1.

Hmm, but this might not directly help. Let me think about the energy equation.

We have:

gamma1 (0.66 M) + gamma2 (0.33 M ) = M.

Divide both sides by M:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

We can write this as:

gamma2 = (1 -0.66 gamma1 ) / 0.33.

But this might not be the easiest approach.

Wait, perhaps we can find another equation involving gamma1 and gamma2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of beta (v/c) and gamma.

Let me denote beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

So v1 = beta1 c, v2= beta2 c.

From the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 beta1 c = gamma2 m2 beta2 c.

Divide both sides by c:

gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

We know m1=2 m2, so substituting:

gamma1 (2 m2) beta1 = gamma2 m2 beta2.

Cancel m2:

2 gamma1 beta1 = gamma2 beta2.

So,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

Now, let's try to express gamma in terms of beta.

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²).

So let's write:

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1) / beta2.

Substituting into the energy equation:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 = 1.

Substituting gamma2,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 (2 gamma1 beta1 / beta2) ) =1.

Hmm, but this seems a bit tangled. Let me think if there's a way to relate beta1 and beta2.

In the non-relativistic case, beta1 ≈ v1/c ≈ 0.1, beta2 = 0.2.

But perhaps in reality, with relativistic effects, beta1 and beta2 are different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that beta1 is much less than 1 and beta2 is also small, but this might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for an approximate solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me denote x = gamma1.

Then,

gamma2 = (2 x beta1 ) / beta2.

Substituting into the energy equation:

0.66 x + 0.33 * (2 x beta1 / beta2 ) =1.

But this still leaves me with beta1 and beta2.

I think this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different method.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the ratio of gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, from the momentum equation:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since m1=2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

Now, divide both sides by gamma2 v2:

(2 gamma1 v1) / (gamma2 v2) )=1.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't helping. Alternatively, I can write gamma2 = (2 gamma1 v1 ) / v2.

Substituting into the energy equation:

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 (2 gamma1 v1 / v2 ) =1.

But even then, it's unclear.

Another approach: perhaps consider that in the center of mass frame, the two fragments move with velocities such that their momenta cancel. But perhaps another way is to consider the velocities in terms of each other.

Wait, let's think about using the ratio of the masses and velocities.

We have m1 = 2 m2.

From the non-relativistic case, we saw that v2 =2 v1. But in the relativistic case, this might not hold exactly because the gamma factors come into play.

But perhaps in the relativistic case, the velocities are not exactly in the same ratio as the non-relativistic case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the kinetic energies and the gamma factors.

The kinetic energy of each fragment is T1 = (gamma1 −1) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 −1) m2 c².

And T1 + T2 =3 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 -1) 0.66 M c² + (gamma2 -1) 0.33 M c² =3 GeV.

But M c² is 300 GeV, so substituting,

( gamma1 -1 ) * 0.66 *300 + (gamma2 -1 ) * 0.33 *300 =3.

Simplify:

( gamma1 -1 ) * 198 + (gamma2 -1 ) *99 =3.

Divide both sides by 3:

( gamma1 -1 ) *66 + (gamma2 -1 ) *33 =1.

Which is,

66 (gamma1 -1 ) + 33 (gamma2-1 ) =1.

Divide both sides by 33,

2 (gamma1 -1 ) + (gamma2-1 ) = (1/33) ≈0.0303.

Hmm, but this still leaves me with two variables.

But earlier, we have another equation from the momentum:

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

And from the energy equation,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

I think this is a system of equations that can be solved, but it's getting a bit involved.

Let me think of another approach. Perhaps use the fact that in the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so the velocities are symmetric. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1, using the momentum equation.

From the momentum equation,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But gamma2 = (gamma1 * 2 beta1 ) / beta2.

Substituting into the energy equation,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 * [ (2 gamma1 beta1 ) / beta2 ] =1.

Hmm. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's solve for gamma2 in terms of gamma1 from the momentum equation.

From gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1,

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1 ) / beta2.

Substitute this into the energy equation:

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 * (2 gamma1 beta1 / beta2 ) =1.

Which is,

gamma1 [ 0.66 + (0.66 beta1 ) / beta2 ] =1.

Hmm, but this still involves beta1 and beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express beta2 in terms of beta1.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, beta2 = 2 beta1.

But in reality, relativistic effects would change this ratio. But perhaps for the sake of approximation, we can assume that beta2 = 2 beta1. Although this is an approximation, perhaps it's valid for a first estimate.

If we make this assumption, then beta2 = 2 beta1.

Then,

gamma2 = (2 gamma1 beta1 ) / (2 beta1 ) )= gamma1.

So gamma2 = gamma1.

Wait, that's interesting. If that's the case, then gamma2 = gamma1.

So substituting into the energy equation,

0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma1 =1 → (0.66 +0.33) gamma1 =1 → gamma1 =1.

But gamma1 =1 implies that the fragment is not moving, which contradicts the non-relativistic case. So this assumption must be wrong.

So assuming beta2 =2 beta1 is invalid in the relativistic case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make another assumption. Let's say that the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M, and the total energy is 300 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 1% of 300 GeV. So perhaps relativistic effects are small, and the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable. But the problem is asking about the difference between the correct value and the non-relativistic one. So perhaps the correct approach would have a small difference, which would be the answer.

Wait, but if the kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass, then perhaps the gamma factors are close to 1, and we can use a Taylor expansion.

So, gamma ≈ 1 + (p²)/(2 m² c² ), where p is the momentum.

Because for small beta, gamma ≈1 + (1/2) beta².

Wait, perhaps it's better to write gamma as 1 + (p²)/(2 m² c² ) + ... for small p.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the kinetic energy is small, maybe the velocities are small, so we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics with a small correction.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to proceed with the non-relativistic case first, and then see what the relativistic case gives.

In the non-relativistic case, we found T1 = 1 GeV.

But let's see what the correct relativistic calculation gives.

Let me think again about the earlier approach.

We have:

Equation 1: 0.66 gamma1 + 0.33 gamma2 =1.

Equation 2: gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But from the velocity relation, in non-relativistic case, v2=2 v1 → beta2=2 beta1.

But in reality, since gamma depends on beta, the relation between beta1 and beta2 is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write beta2 in terms of beta1.

But this seems tricky. Maybe I can find a relation between gamma1 and gamma2 using the momentum equation.

Wait, from equation 2,

gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But beta = v/c. So,

gamma2 (v2/c) = 2 gamma1 (v1/c).

Multiply both sides by c:

gamma2 v2 = 2 gamma1 v1.

Which is the same as the momentum equation.

Hmm. Let's think about the kinetic energies.

We have T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

And T1 + T2=3 GeV.

Which is,

(gamma1 -1) *0.66 *300 + (gamma2 -1)*0.33 *300 =3.

Simplify:

( gamma1 -1 ) * 198 + (gamma2 -1)*99 =3.

Divide both sides by 3:

( gamma1 -1 ) *66 + (gamma2 -1)*33 =1.

Expanding,

66 gamma1 -66 +33 gamma2 -33 =1.

So,

66 gamma1 +33 gamma2 =1 +66 +33 =100.

Divide both sides by 33:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33 ≈3.0303.

Equation 3: 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈3.0303.

Now, from equation 1,

0.66 gamma1 +0.33 gamma2 =1.

We can write this as:

Multiply both sides by100,

66 gamma1 +33 gamma2=100.

Which is the same as equation 3. So, these are the same equation, which suggests that I'm not adding new information. Hmm.

So I need another equation.

Equation 2: gamma2 beta2 = 2 gamma1 beta1.

But I need to find a relation between beta1 and beta2.

Wait, perhaps I can express beta2 in terms of beta1 using gamma factors.

From the energy equation, I have 2 gamma1 + gamma2=100/33 ≈3.0303.

Let me solve for gamma2:

gamma2= (100/33) - 2 gamma1.

Substituting into equation 2:

[ (100/33 -2 gamma1 ) * beta2 ] =2 gamma1 beta1.

Hmm.

But I still have two variables, beta1 and beta2.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an assumption that beta2 is much larger than beta1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate beta1 and beta2 via their velocities.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, beta2=2 beta1.

But in reality, due to relativistic effects, beta2 may be larger or smaller than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me denote beta2= k beta1, where k is some constant to be determined.

So,

beta2= k beta1.

Substituting into equation 2:

gamma2 (k beta1 ) =2 gamma1 beta1.

Cancel beta1:

gamma2 k =2 gamma1.

But gamma2= (100/33 ) - 2 gamma1.

So,

( (100/33) - 2 gamma1 ) *k = 2 gamma1.

Hmm.

But this gives me an equation in terms of gamma1 and k.

I'm not sure if this helps. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can write beta in terms of gamma.

We know that beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So,

beta1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1² )).

Similarly,

beta2= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2² )).

Substituting into equation 2.

gamma2 beta2 =2 gamma1 beta1.

So,

gamma2 * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma2² )) = 2 gamma1 * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1² )).

Hmm. This seems complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides.

[ gamma2^2 (1 - 1/gamma2^2) ) ] =4 gamma1^2 (1 -1/gamma1^2 )

Simplify left side:

gamma2^2 ( ( gamma2^2 -1 ) / gamma2^2 ) ) = gamma2^2 -1.

Similarly, right side:4 gamma1^2 ( (gamma1^2 -1 ) / gamma1^2 ) )=4 (gamma1^2 -1).

So,

gamma2^2 -1 =4 (gamma1^2 -1 )

gamma2^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

But from equation 3, gamma2 = (100/33 ) -2 gamma1.

So,

gamma2^2 = ( (100/33 ) -2 gamma1 )^2.

So,

( (100/33 ) -2 gamma1 )^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Let me expand the left side.

( a -b )² =a² - 2ab +b².

So,

= (100/33)^2 - 4 (100/33 ) gamma1 +4 gamma1².

Set equal to right side:

(100/33)^2 -4 (100/33 ) gamma1 +4 gamma1^2 =4 gamma1^2 -3.

Subtract 4 gamma1^2 from both sides:

(100/33)^2 -4 (100/33 ) gamma1 = -3.

Multiply both sides by 33² to eliminate denominators:

100^2 -4*100 *33 gamma1 = -3 *33^2.

Compute:

100^2=10000.

4 *100 *33=13200.

-3 *33^2= -3 *1089= -3267.

So,

10000 -13200 gamma1 = -3267.

Move 10000 to the right:

-13200 gamma1 = -3267 -10000 = -13267.

Divide both sides by -13200:

gamma1 = 13267 /13200 ≈1.00508.

So gamma1 ≈1.00508.

Then,

gamma2 = (100/33) -2*1.00508 ≈3.0303 -2.01016≈1.02014.

So,

gamma1 ≈1.00508,

gamma2≈1.02014.

Now, let's compute the kinetic energies T1 and T2.

T1 = (gamma1 -1 ) m1 c² = (0.00508 ) *0.66 *300 GeV.

Wait, 0.66 *300 =198 GeV.

So,

0.00508 *198 ≈ approximately 1.005 GeV.

Similarly, T2=(gamma2 -1 ) m2 c² = (0.02014 ) *0.33 *300.

0.33 *300=99 GeV.

0.02014 *99 ≈2.0 GeV.

Wait, but T1 + T2 ≈1.005 + 2.0 =3.005 GeV, which is close to 3 GeV. So the numbers make sense.

In the non-relativistic case, T1 was 1 GeV. But relativistically, T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV. So the difference between the correct T1 and the classical approximation is about 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5 MeV.

So the correct answer is B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approximations to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass \( M \) and rest-mass energy \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
- After fission, the two fragments have rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \).
- The total rest-mass energy of the fragments is \( 0.99M c^2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) of energy converted into kinetic energy.

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case:
1. The fragments' masses are \( m_1 = 0.66M \) and \( m_2 = 0.33M \).
2. Conservation of momentum gives \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), leading to \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).
3. The total kinetic energy is distributed as \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 \) and \( T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 \).
4. Substituting \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), we find \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( T_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Relativistic Calculation
In the relativistic case:
1. The total energy of each fragment is \( \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
2. Conservation of energy and momentum gives:
   - \( \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 + \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = M c^2 \),
   - \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \).
3. Using \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), the momentum equation simplifies to \( 2\gamma_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 v_2 \).
4. Solving the system of equations, we find:
   - \( \gamma_1 \approx 1.00508 \),
   - \( \gamma_2 \approx 1.02014 \).
5. The kinetic energies are:
   - \( T_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( T_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1)m_2 c^2 \approx 2.0 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \), while the relativistic \( T_1 \) is approximately \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:

\[
\Delta T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic approximation is **5 MeV**.
