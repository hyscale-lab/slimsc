Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with vector calculus yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude of the field is given by f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So the integral is of ∇ · f over the volume of the sphere. Wait, I remember that the divergence of a vector field relates to how the field is spreading out or converging at a point. Also, from what I recall, there's something called the Divergence Theorem, which connects the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, the Divergence Theorem is also known as Gauss's Theorem. So maybe I can use that here.

So the Divergence Theorem states that the integral of ∇ · F over a volume V is equal to the flux of F through the surface S of V. So, ∫∫∫_V (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫_S f · dA.

In this problem, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface S is the sphere of radius R. So, if I can compute the flux through this surface, that would solve the problem.

Wait, but what is the flux through the surface S of the sphere?
