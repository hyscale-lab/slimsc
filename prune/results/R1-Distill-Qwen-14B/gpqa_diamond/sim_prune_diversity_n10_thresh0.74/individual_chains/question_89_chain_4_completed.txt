Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid and has four bridgehead carbons. The molecule has two bromine atoms attached to adjacent bridgehead carbons, I think. 

So, when it's heated with excess KOH at 240°C, it's probably undergoing an elimination reaction. The product is a light yellow solid. Let me think about what reaction that might be. KOH is a strong base, so elimination makes sense. It's likely a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene because two HBr molecules are eliminated. Since the starting compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two Br atoms would form a double bond between the bridgehead carbons. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Or wait, maybe it's a diene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H, probably a doublet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, these are likely the adamantane ring protons, maybe in a multiplet), and 1.94 (2H, maybe a methylene group adjacent to the double bond). The IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is formed from dehydrohalogenation, which should form an alkene. But 1720 is more like a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, could it be a lactone or some kind of cyclic ester? Or perhaps the product is an epoxide? No, because the IR for epoxide would have different peaks.

Wait, another possibility: if KOH is in excess and heating, maybe it's not just elimination but also some kind of ring-opening. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. So when KOH is used, maybe it deprotonates and forms a base-induced elimination, leading to a bridgehead double bond. But the IR having a carbonyl doesn't fit that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure. Another thought: Maybe the product is an epoxide. But the IR here doesn't show the typical epoxide C-O stretch which is around 1250-1350 cm-1. So maybe not.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl. So perhaps the starting material undergoes some oxidation. But heating with KOH... wait, if the molecule undergoes elimination to form a double bond, but also maybe some rearrangement, but why would that produce a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but an ester or ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination, which could form an alkene. But the IR of product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe after elimination, some oxidation occurs? Or perhaps another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a carbonyl compound. Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Maybe the product is a ketone. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a Br and leads to elimination, but with another process forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Williamson ether synthesis, but that would require an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet, maybe. Wait, the integral is 2H. So maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's adjacent to a carbonyl. So maybe the group is a CH2 next to a ketone. For example, a ketone would have nearby CH2 groups that would absorb around 2.1-2.4 ppm. But the 4.79 ppm is a higher shift, maybe for an -OCH2- group, but then maybe that's part of an ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide with some adjacent protons. Wait, but for epoxides, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5, so maybe 4.79 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would two bromines lead to that? Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene, but then where's the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the product is when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Let me recall some reactions. Oh, wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can undergo an elimination reaction to form a double bond. But in this case, the structure of adamantane may not allow for a simple double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a ring-opening.

Wait, adamantane has a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When treated with KOH, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice and forming a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons. But in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are not usually sites for double bonds because of Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bicyclic systems. But adamantane is a larger molecule, so maybe it's possible.

If product 1 is an adamantadiene, then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because of some oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction forms a gem-diol. But that's more for vicinal dihalides with water. Or perhaps KOH is causing a substitution to form an epoxide.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a Fittig reaction, but that's for aryl halides. No, not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH undergoes a double elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but I don't remember a reaction where elimination of two HBr leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 group, perhaps part of an epoxide, but then the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a ketone group would have neighboring CH2 groups that might appear around 2.2-2.4 ppm, but the 4.79 ppm is higher.

Wait, another angle: The production of a light yellow solid suggests maybe an epoxide. But as I thought before, the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, a conjugated diene may have a lower carbonyl, but I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonyl compound. Let me think: If the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, which forms a double bond, but then maybe a rearrangement occurs, like a keto-enol tautomerism. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the product is a dione. Like two ketone groups. But how would that form from elimination? I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure how KOH would form that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction, but I'm not sure what's reacting.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an aldehyde or ketone. Then, using AlCl3 (or Al(i-Pr)3), perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

But wait, product 1's IR has a carbonyl. So product 2 is made from product 1 via Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else with a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane? Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a diene. Because AlCl3 can catalyze elimination reactions.

So, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when heated with Al(i-Pr)3, it loses two water molecules (if it's a diketone, maybe adjacent to hydroxyl groups, but I'm not sure) to form a double bond. So product 2 would be a diene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bonds into carbonyl groups. But product 3 is the result after ozonolysis.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the steps.

Let me try to think again. Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (with carbonyl). Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but the IR suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing an elimination and then oxidation. Hmm, but KOH itself isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless it's in a certain condition.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide. If the reaction forms an epoxide, but then the NMR wouldn't show the 4.79 as a singlet.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the IR of product 1. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, probably sharp peak, indicative of a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Maybe it's a ketone or an ester.

So, from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, how does treatment with KOH give a ketone?

Hmm, perhaps the bromines are in positions that, upon elimination, lead to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe oxidation occurs. Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Unless there's some air in the reaction, but it's heated at 240°C, so maybe it's more of a dehydrohalogenation with some other change.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the base is causing a substitution, but with two bromines, perhaps it's forming a geminal diol. But that would require water, and the product would have OH groups. But the product is a light yellow solid, which might not fit.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but then there's some ring opening or rearrangement to form a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the product is a lactone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me think: If the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, elimination of HBr from each would form a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible due to Bredt's rule. So perhaps the molecule rearranges, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl formed via elimination and rearrangement. For example, forming a conjugated diene which then tautomerizes into a carbonyl compound. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane derivative with a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should move on to the next steps, assuming that product 1 has a carbonyl group. Then, when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. But since product 2 is then ozonized, maybe product 2 has a double bond.

Wait, ozonolysis is used to break double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl(s) where the double bond was.

But looking at the options, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, perhaps after ozonolysis, certain hydrogens are split into particular multiplets.

Wait, maybe product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis breaks it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 might have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to some CH2 groups.

But I'm getting stuck on what product 1 is. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

Another approach: Let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with four bridgehead carbons in a chair-like structure. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated, leading to a double bond between those two bridgehead carbons. However, because Bredt's rule says that bridgehead double bonds are unstable in small bicyclic systems, but adamantane is a larger structure, perhaps it can support a bridgehead double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diamantadiene, which would have a double bond where the Br atoms were.

But then, the IR would show a peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ for the C=C stretch, but the given IR is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization. But that's for cyclic esters, and I don't see an ester here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some elimination and oxidation. Wait, but how would KOH cause oxidation?

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromines adjacent, maybe it's forming a cyclopropane ring. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a double substitution: each Br is replaced by an -O- group, leading to a cyclic ether. But then the IR would show O-H stretch for the ether, but the given IR is carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. Let's imagine that each Br in 1,3-dibromoadamantane is replaced by a carbonyl group. But how would that happen? Oh, perhaps via oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. So that's probably not it.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should think about the IR and NMR data together. Product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, maybe it's an ester group, like OCH2COOR. But wait, product 1 is formed from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Not sure how that would form an ester.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 next to a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone with a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R.

Wait, then what about the NMR peaks? The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be the adamantane ring protons, perhaps in a multiplet. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So, product 1 might be 1,3-adamantanone, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it's a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, when it's treated with Al(i-Pr)3, maybe it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a diene. Because AlCl3 is a catalyst for such eliminations, perhaps it's a dehydration of the diketone, forming a conjugated diene.

So product 2 would be a diene. Then, when ozonolysis is performed, the diene is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two ketone groups where the double bonds were.

The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would likely be near the carbonyl groups, so maybe they are adjacent to CH2 groups.

In ozonolysis of a diene, like 1,3-diene, the ozone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. If the diene was symmetric, then the resulting product would have two identical carbonyl groups.

But considering the adamantane structure, perhaps the diene is in a position where the resulting carbonyl groups are attached to CH2 groups which are split into certain multiplets.

Wait, but the ozonolysis of a diene would give two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. For example, if the diene was CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes, CH2O and OCHO, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, if the diene is part of a ring, ozonolysis would open the ring and form a diketone.

But in the case of adamantane, the structure is rigid. So perhaps the diene is part of a bridge structure, and ozonolysis would cleave it into a diketone with CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls.

In product 3, the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls. These protons are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl, so they appear upfield or downfield? Wait, deshielded means downfield. So their chemical shift would be higher.

In such cases, the CH2 groups next to carbonyls are typically split into a triplet or a quartet, depending on neighboring protons. Wait, but the coupling in aldehydes is usually a triplet if there's coupling with two adjacent protons.

Wait, let me think: If the CH2 group is adjacent to a carbonyl, each proton on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 group. So each proton would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the structure might be more complex. Suppose the product is a diketone where each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group. For example, O=C-(CH2)n-C=O. In such a case, the CH2 groups are next to the carbonyl, and each CH2 has two protons.

Each of these protons would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet. But wait, each CH2 group is split by the neighboring CH2 group, so each would be a triplet. So the most deshielded hydrogens (the ones adjacent to the carbonyls) would be a triplet.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is split by two other protons (like adjacent to another CH2), then each would be a quartet. Wait, no, in a simple CH2-CH2 system, each proton is split into a triplet by the adjacent CH2 group. So, each CH2 would be a triplet.

But wait, if a CH2 group is next to another CH2 group, each proton on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two protons on the second CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, the structure might be such that the CH2 groups are next to the carbonyl and possibly also adjacent to another CH2 group. Let me imagine product 3 is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would each have two neighboring protons (from the other CH2 group), leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be those adjacent to the carbonyl, so they would be a triplet. Looking at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but I'm not totally sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 group would be adjacent to another CH2. The middle CH2 group would have neighboring protons on both sides, so each H would couple with 2 on each side, leading to a quartet. But the CH2 groups at the ends would each have neighbors on only one side, so they would be triplets.

But since the question asks for the most deshielded, which are the ones next to the carbonyl, those would be the end CH2 groups, which are triplets.

But wait, in the ozonolysis product, perhaps the splitting is more complicated. For example, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and the coupling is between each pair, each proton would be split into a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs on one side and maybe another set, leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, but for a simple CH2-CH2 group, the coupling between each CH2's Hs would lead to each H being a triplet. Because each H on the first CH2 is split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded Hs are adjacent to carbonyl groups, and they are part of a CH2 that's next to another CH2 group. So their coupling would be a triplet.

So the answer would be option A, triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, a dehydrohalogenation reaction occurs, leading to the elimination of two HBr molecules. This forms a conjugated diene, likely 1,3-adamantadiene. The IR spectrum of the product (1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the diene undergoes further rearrangement or oxidation to form a diketone, such as 1,3-adamantanedione.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   The diketone (product 1) is then treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This likely promotes a Friedel-Crafts-like elimination, forming a conjugated diene (product 2). The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined but is assumed to be a diene suitable for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 cleaves the double bond, forming carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is a diketone with CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls. The most deshielded hydrogen atoms in product 3 are the CH₂ protons directly adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyls are split by the neighboring CH₂ groups. Each proton on a CH₂ group couples with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. This is consistent with the splitting observed for CH₂ groups near carbonyls in such structures.

Based on this analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a **triplet**.

ANSWER: A
