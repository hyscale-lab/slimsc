Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The problem states that the outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with some endpoint Q.

Then, in the variant decay, instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So, the decay becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. I need to figure out how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes in this new scenario.

Hmm, I remember something about particle decay and energy spectra. Oh right, in beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the decay involves multiple particles, and energy isn't just divided neatly. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the total available energy minus the masses involved.

Wait, but in the first case, there are two E and two V particles. If the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies vary, so the decay isn't limited to a single energy value. Continuous spectra usually happen when multiple particles are emitted, allowing for a range of possible energies.

When you change the decay products, like replacing two V's with one M (which is massless), I'm guessing that affects the energy distribution. Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy released in the decay (Q value) should be the same, right? Because it's the same reaction, just different products. Or does it change? Wait, the Q is given as the endpoint for E particles in the original decay.

Wait, the original decay emits two E and two V. Now, the variant emits two E and one M. So, the number of E particles is the same. But the emitted V's are replaced by M, which is massless. Hmm. So, does that affect the energy each E can have?

In the original case, each E and V must share the energy. Since V has some mass, perhaps that influences the maximum energy an E can have. But in the variant, since M is massless, maybe the energy division changes.

Wait, another point: in the original decay, if E's have a continuous spectrum, that implies that their energies are not fixed. So, maybe
