Okay, so I've got this problem about a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to calculate all possible states and their corresponding energies, then sum up the exponentials.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, how many possible states are there? Each has two options, so 2^3=8 states. That’s manageable. I'll list them all and calculate E for each.

Let me denote the spins as S1, S2, S3. So possible combinations are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, compute the energy E.

The formula for E is -J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term is the product of two spins, multiplied by -J and summed over all pairs.

Let me compute each term:

1. State (+1, +1, +1)
S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum = 3 → E= -J*(3) = -3J

2. State (+1, +1, -1)
S1S2=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum=1-1-1= -1 → E= -J*(-1)= J

3. State (+1, -1, +1)
S1S2=1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3=(-1)*1= -1. Sum= -1+1-1= -1 → E= J

4. State (+1, -1, -1)
S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= (-1)*(-1)=1. Sum= -1-1+1= -1 → E= J

5. State (-1, +1, +1)
S1S2= (-1)*1= -1, S1S3= (-1)*1= -1, S2S3=1*1=1. Sum= -1-1+1= -1 → E= J

6. State (-1, +1, -1)
S1S2= (-1)*1= -1, S1S3= (-1)*(-1)=1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum= -1+1-1= -1 → E= J

7. State (-1, -1, +1)
S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1, S1S3= (-1)*1= -1, S2S3= (-1)*1= -1. Sum= 1-1-1= -1 → E= J

8. State (-1, -1, -1)
Each product: 1,1,1. Sum=3 → E= -3J

Wait, so looking at the energies:

States 1 and 8 have E = -3J.

All other states (2-7) have E = J.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-β E) for each state.

Each state contributes exp(-β E) to Z.

So for states 1 and 8: each contributes exp(3β J) because E is -3J.

For states 2-7: 6 states, each contributes exp(-β J).

Wait, no, wait. Because E is J, so exp(-β E) is exp(-β J).

Wait, because E is in the exponent as -β E. So for E = -3J, it's exp(3β J), and for E=J, it's exp(-β J).

So, the partition function Z is:

Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J)

Wait, but looking at the options
