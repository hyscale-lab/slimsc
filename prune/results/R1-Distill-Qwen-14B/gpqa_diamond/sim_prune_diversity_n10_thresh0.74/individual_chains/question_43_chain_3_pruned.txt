Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about IUPAC naming. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question describes a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me list them out as I understand from the description.

First, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they're separated by two carbons, right? So if one is at position 1, the others are at 3 and 5, but wait, that depends on how they're arranged.

Wait, actually, the problem says all three are meta to one another. So they form a meta arrangement. That would mean their positions are 1, 3, and 5 on the benzene ring. Or maybe 2, 4, 6? Wait, no, because the substituents are all meta, meaning each is separated by two carbons. But three substituents can't all be meta to each other without being at 1, 3, 5. Because if one is at 1, another at 3 (two positions away), and the third at 5 (four positions away from 1, which is same as two in the other direction). So they form a sort of triangular arrangement around the ring.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their exact positions, only their relationships relative to each other and to other substituents. So maybe I should try to draw the structure.

Let me imagine the
