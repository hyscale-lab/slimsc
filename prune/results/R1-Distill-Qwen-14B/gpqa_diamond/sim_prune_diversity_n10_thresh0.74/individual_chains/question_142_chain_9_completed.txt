Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. This one looks like a classical mixture of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Wait, because both terms are present and the coefficients are 1/2 each, so it's an equal mixture. That must mean it's a completely mixed state, right?

I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and for a general state, it's given by:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, for |0⟩, which is a pure state, the density matrix is |0⟩⟨0|, which in Bloch vector terms is (0,0,1) because |0⟩ is along the +z axis.

Similarly, |1⟩ is (0,0,-1), but wait, when you write |1⟩⟨1|, it's (I - |0⟩⟨0|) so the Bloch vector would be (0,0,-1). But wait, no, because for |1⟩, it's the same as (I - σ_z)/2, so the Bloch vector is (0,0,-1).

But in our case, the density matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute this. Let's see:

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], so each diagonal is 1. Then, multiplying by 1/2, we get [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Wait, but the identity matrix in 2x2 dimensions is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. So ρ is (I)/2. How does this relate to the Bloch vector?

The general form for a density matrix is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if ρ is (I)/2, that implies that r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. Because all the terms with σ would be zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0).

Wait, but wait a second. Because the identity matrix is a completely mixed state, meaning it's the maximally mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere, that's the origin, because it's equally a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, which are at opposite poles. So in the Bloch vector, the point is at the center, with coordinates (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that should be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the density matrix ρ for a mixed state is a statistical mixture. For the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So it's a 50% chance of being in |0⟩ and 50% in |1⟩. The expectation value of any Pauli matrix would be zero because:

⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2)(⟨0|σ_x|0⟩ + ⟨1|σ_x|1⟩). But σ_x flips |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa, so ⟨0|σ_x|0⟩ is zero, same for ⟨1|σ_x|1⟩. So the expectation for σ_x is zero. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z, except that for σ_z, wait:

Wait, let me compute Tr(ρ σ_z). σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So,

ρ σ_z = (1/2)( |0⟩⟨0| σ_z + |1⟩⟨1| σ_z )

But σ_z |0⟩ = |0⟩, so |0⟩⟨0| σ_z = |0⟩⟨0| * 1. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| σ_z = |1⟩⟨1| * (-1). So when we take Tr(ρ σ_z):

Tr( (1/2)( |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| ) σ_z ) = (1/2)(1 * ⟨0|0⟩ + (-1) * ⟨1|1⟩ ) = (1/2)(1 -1) = 0.

So all the components of the Bloch vector are zero, so the point is at the origin.

Therefore, the correct option is C) r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), making it a maximally mixed state. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, while mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that the terms involving \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) are absent. This implies that \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is the identity matrix scaled by \(1/2\). In the Bloch sphere, this is represented as the point at the center, with coordinates \((0, 0, 0)\).

Thus, the correct answer is:
