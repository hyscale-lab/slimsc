Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit rusty on stellar abundances, but I'll try to think through this.

Wait, the problem gives me some stuff about [Fe/H], [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si], and [Mg/H]. I remember that these are logarithmic abundance ratios. Right, the notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_Sun. So it's like, the star's abundance compared to the Sun's.

First, let me jot down the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So [Fe/H] is the log base 10 of (Fe/H) ratio relative to the Sun. Zero means Fe abundance same as the Sun.

Star_2:
- Mass 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Mg to Si ratio is 10^0.3 times solar.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So Mg is at solar abundance.

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 → Wait, 12 + log(...) =7.5 → log(...) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) is 7.5 -12? Wait no, the Sun's data says 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7.5? No, wait original problem says:

Wait the Sun's data is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =1e-4.5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → So log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Oh right, because 12 is the base, and each term is 12 + log(...), so subtract 12.

Now I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2] or [nSi(Star1)/nH(Star1)] divided by [nSi(Star2)/nH(Star2)]?

Wait, no. The ratio is nSi1 / nSi2, where nSi is in each star's photosphere. Or perhaps nSi in Star_1 over nSi in Star_2.

Wait, the question says
