Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. In the classical case, like a mass on a spring, the force is F = -kx. But this is a relativistic version, so I guess special relativity comes into play here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², right? And the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². So equating them, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so maybe that's not the case anymore.

In relativity, things are different because as speeds approach the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy equation changes. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy of the oscillator would consist of the rest mass energy plus the potential energy of the spring. Wait, but in the classical case, the total energy is all potential at maximum displacement. So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, is that correct? Or does the potential energy also have a relativistic form?

I'm a bit confused. Wait, the maximum potential energy would be when the mass is at rest, right? Because potential energy is maximum when velocity is zero. So maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², as before. But when the mass is moving, its kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, actually, in the harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. When it's moving through the equilibrium point, all the energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy can't be more than the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So maybe E = (1/2)kA² +
