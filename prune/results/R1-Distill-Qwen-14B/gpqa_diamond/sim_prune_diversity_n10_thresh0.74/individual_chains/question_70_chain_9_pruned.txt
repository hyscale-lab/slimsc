Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, the question gives a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of E based on that.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions step by step. 

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Bright red product... I'm thinking maybe something like sulfur trioxide (SO3) or perhaps another compound with strong colors. Wait, but sulfur trioxide isn't red. Oh, maybe it's something else. Wait, another bright red compound could be a transition metal complex, like maybe a chromium compound? Or perhaps it's something like a permanganate, but those are usually more purple. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate compound. Hmm. Alternatively, if B is a diatomic gas, perhaps it's O2 or Cl2? Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe B is a halogen?

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So C and D reacting. Maybe D is another gas, perhaps O2 or another diatomic. Wait, but D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about D reacting with B to form H. So if D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio, maybe they form something like HCl from H2 and Cl2 (but that's 1:1). But H is a solvent. Another possibility is H2O, but that would require D being O2 and B being H2, but then C would be something else. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2, but that would form HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, maybe D is O2 and B is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense.

Wait, let's map this out. So if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. So H is water. So D
