Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me data about both the star and the two planets. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets have been detected via transit and radial velocity methods, which probably means that their masses are known, as well as their orbital periods because of the Doppler shifts.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits, which simplifies things a bit because we don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting their temperatures.

The question also mentions something about periodic shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2's shift is up to 0.04 Å. Wait, but how does that relate to the planets' equilibrium temperatures? Oh, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So the Doppler shift gives us the velocity amplitude, which can be used to find the planet's mass and the distance from the star? Or maybe the period?

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures, which depend on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. So maybe the RV method gives us the mass and the period, which would let me calculate the orbital radius using Kepler's laws. But the problem is, how?

I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period, the mass of the star, and the semi-major axis (distance). The formula is (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_star + M_planet))/(4π²). But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star, M_star + M_planet is approximately M_star. So we can write a^3 = (G M_star) * (P^2)/(4π²).

But wait, we don't have the periods of the planets, do we? The question gives us the Doppler shifts, which relate to the velocity of the star. The RV method
