Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the explicit form is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Wait, first I need to remember what the uncertainty principle says. Oh right, the uncertainty ΔA is calculated as the square root of the expectation value of A squared minus the square of the expectation value of A. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, right? Because it's an eigenstate of P_x. So calculating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ should give me something, and then the uncertainty comes from that.

So the steps I need to take are: 

1. Find the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩.
2. Find the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩.
3. Compute the variance (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).
4. Take the square root to get the uncertainty.

But how do I compute these expectation values? Since the state is given, I can compute matrix elements using the given vector.

First, I'll note that the state is a column vector ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that down.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector with elements [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2] but conjugated if any complex
