Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their developmental role. So, the setup involves creating a bicistronic vector with both ligand and receptor genes. 

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two open reading frames (ORFs). The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe for expression. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the second gene without a second promoter.

Looking at the stops: between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP and lox2272 are sites recognized by Cre recombinase. When Cre is expressed, it recombines these sites, causing the stop cassette to be removed, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

So, when they use this vector in primary astrocytes, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. On a Western blot, they see signals proportional to actin, meaning their loading controls are working.

But here's the kicker: they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre here would be expressed in neural crest cells.

After the mice are born, they look under the confocal microscope for fluorescent signals. They expected green (from eGFP) but didn't see any. The question is why.

Options are A to D.

Let me think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the GFP is on the receptor, so if the receptor is expressed, you should see the GFP. But maybe if the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere, but I'm not sure how that affects the GFP detection. Not the first thing that comes to mind.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface. So the antibody against eGFP wouldn't detect it, but the Western blot showed the proteins were expressed. Wait, but the Western blot uses total proteins, so if the eGFP is stuck in the ER or Golgi, it might still be present in the lysate. Unless the eGFP isn't properly processed. Wait, but the question says the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe both mCherry and eGFP were tested? Or perhaps the problem is in the construct.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which should be sufficient. The receptor is after an IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So maybe the enhancer is missing, leading to no expression. But I thought CBA is a strong promoter. However, if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression is low. But in the Western blot, they saw expression, so maybe this isn't it.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, right, if the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed. So the fusion would be messed up. But in this case, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP with a stop cassette. So, the stop cassette is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. If the eGFP is out of frame, then perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed properly, so the Western blot wouldn't detect it.

Wait, but the question says they expressed the construct in primary astrocytes and used antibodies against overexpressed proteins. So in the Western blot, they probably saw the proteins. But in the mouse, they didn't see GFP.

Wait, but the mouse is in a SOX10-Cre background. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre would only be active in those cells. So in the mouse, the construct would be activated (loxP sites recombined) in neural crest-derived cells. But if the GFP isn't expressed, perhaps the eGFP isn't being made.

Alternatively, maybe the GFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong. So the eGFP is not properly expressed. So the Western blot would detect the receptor (since it's fused to eGFP, but if the frame is wrong, perhaps the eGFP isn't there. Wait, no, the ORF is for the receptor, and then the eGFP is in frame? Or maybe the construct is such that the eGFP is in frame. If the stop cassette is in between, perhaps after recombination, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF. So if the frame is off, the eGFP won't be expressed correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette wasn't removed. Because in the vector, both the ligand and receptor have stop cassettes. Wait, the ligand has loxP-stop-loxP, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272, so Cre (loxP recomb) can't act on it. Wait, wait, loxP and lox2272 are different; lox2272 is a variant that can't recombine with loxP. So to remove the stop cassette after the receptor, you need a Cre that can recognize lox2272. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is probably a standard Cre that can only cut loxP sites. So the lox2272 sites wouldn't be cut.

Wait, this is a key point. The ligand is under loxP
