Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about this. So, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly balancedâ€”right, so it's when the incoming energy equals the outgoing energy. The formula I remember is something like T = T* ( ( (1 - A)/d^2 ) )^0.25, where T* is the star's effective temperature, A is albedo, and d is the distance from the star. But wait, albedo is the same for all planets here, so A cancels out in the ratio.

The problem says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. Wait, but orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. The law says P^2 is proportional to a^3, where a is the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, a is the radius. So a^3 = (P^2) * (G*M*...), but since all planets are around the same star, M is constant. So, a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because a = ( (G*M * P^2 )/(4 pi^2) )^(1/3 ), right?

So for each planet, the distance from the star would be proportional to P^(2/3). So the ratio of distances between planets would be the cube root of the square of their period ratios. Wait, let me think. If planet 2 has a period twice that of planet 1, then (P2/P1)=2. So (a2/a1) = ( (P2/P1) )^(2/3) = 2^(2/3). Similarly, for planet 4, P4=3.5, so P4/P2 is (3.5)/(2) = 1.75. So (a4/a2) would be (1.75)^(2/3).

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance since it's inversely proportional to the square of the distance. So the temperature ratio between planet4 and planet2 is ( (d2/d4) )^0.5. Because T is proportional to (1
