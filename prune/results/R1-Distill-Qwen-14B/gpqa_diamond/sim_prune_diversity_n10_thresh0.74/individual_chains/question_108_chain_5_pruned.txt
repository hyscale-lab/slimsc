Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that we have a magnetic field B pointing along the Oz axis, and it's small. The value of B is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is related to the Balmer series in hydrogen, specifically the H-alpha line. So that's the visible transition from n=2 to n=1, or wait, no, wait. Wait, Balmer series is n→2, so the transition from higher to n=2. Oh wait, no, wait. The Balmer series is for transitions that end at n=2. The H-alpha line is the transition from n=3 to n=2, which emits a photon with wavelength about 0.656 micrometers. Oh wait, but the question gives 0.4861 micrometers. Oh right, that's the Balmer beta line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, right? So the wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which corresponds to a certain energy ΔE.

Wait, but maybe I need to find the energy ΔE for that transition. So, the energy levels in hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula: E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h²) * (1/n²), but I think it's easier to remember it in terms of the Rydberg constant R, where E_n = - R h c / n². Oh right, because E_n = -13.6 eV / n² approximately.

So let me calculate the energy ΔE. The transition is from some n_initial to n_final. Given λ=0.4861e-6 meters. Wait, the wavelength is given for the emitted photon. Using the relation E = hc/λ, so the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ.

So the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^{-1}, but maybe using E = hc/(λ) is better. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So let's compute ΔE = h c / λ. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

Calculating:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 0.4861e-6 m

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) 

Let me compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = approximately 4.089e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should convert that to eV because energies are often expressed in electron volts. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so:

ΔE (eV) = 4.089e-20 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 0.255 eV.

So the transition energy is about 0.255 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the term in the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's magnetic moment. The Hamiltonian for this is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (e/(2m)) * ħ * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, e is the charge, m is the electron mass, ħ is hbar, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but more accurately, μ = -g μ_B S, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator. Since the field is along Oz, the quantization axis, the expectation value <H> would be proportional to m_s, the spin quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the problem says m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, but that might not be relevant here. Wait, no, the problem statement says: "for a magnetic field B parallel to Oz, with small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". Hmm, but in the paramagnetic term, the coupling involves the spin, not the orbital angular momentum. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the paramagnetic effect arises from the spin of the electron. So the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect in a magnetic field B is H = - μ·B, where μ
