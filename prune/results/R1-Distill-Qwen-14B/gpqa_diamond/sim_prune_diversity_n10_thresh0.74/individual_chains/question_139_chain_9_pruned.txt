Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves two compounds, A and B, being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. The result is two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B would produce those diketones.

Wait, the reactions produce diketones. So I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, they undergo some kind of ring-forming reaction. Oh, right! The Beckmann rearrangement comes to mind. Beckmann rearrangement usually involves oximes, which are formed when hydroxylamine reacts with ketones or aldehydes. But wait, the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh, waitâ€”maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, could it be the formation of a diazonium salt followed by some kind of cyclization?

Wait, HCl and NaNO2 are typically used to form diazonium salts from aromatic amines, but in a different context. Oh wait, maybe it's about the formation of cyclic ketones from some other structures. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and H2O is part of the preparation of a carbonyl group. Oh, right! The Stephen reduction or something else? No, maybe it's a Hofmann degradation. Wait, no. Alternatively, could this be a case where
