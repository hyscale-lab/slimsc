Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. There are a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through B, C, D, and finally forming E. Also, there are some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Additionally, the problem gives two hints:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options provided are A, B, C, D, each being a cyclic ketone.

Alright, let's break this down.

Step 1: A to B with HCN.

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A reacts with HCN, it must have a carbonyl group. The reaction with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So, A is likely a ketone or aldehyde. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 supports this because that's the range for carbonyl (C=O) stretching. So, A is a ketone.

So, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The structure would have an -OH and a -CN group added across the carbonyl carbon.

So, B is a cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B to C with H2 and Pd.

Hydrogenation with Pd usually reduces triple bonds, maybe double bonds. Wait, but in this case, B is a cyanohydrin. Let me think: the structure of B would have an -OH and -CN group attached to the same carbon. So, perhaps when H2 and Pd are used, it reduces the nitrile group. Wait, but nitriles (CN) can be reduced to amines, but more commonly, under hydrogenation, they might be reduced to CH2NH2 or CH2NH groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are different.

Wait, cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons. So, when you hydrogenate it, maybe the nitrile (-CN) group gets reduced to a methylene group (-CH2-). So, the -CN becomes -CH2NH2? Or maybe under certain conditions, it could be reduced further. Wait, wait, when you reduce a nitrile with hydrogen and a catalyst like Pd, it typically converts to an amine. But am I sure about that? Let me think: Hydrogenation of nitriles usually requires a catalyst like Raney Ni or sometimes Pd, and it's typically done under high pressure. The product is a primary amine. So, R-CN + H2 â†’ R-CH2-NH2.

But wait, in this case, B is a cyanohydrin, which is R-C(OH)(CN). So, if you reduce the nitrile group, you'd get R-C(OH)(CH2NH2). But that's a possible outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation would reduce the alcohol to a CH2 group, but that's less likely because alcohols are generally not reduced under Pd/H2 conditions unless it's a strong reducing environment, like catalytic hydrogenation with higher pressure and temperature, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, maybe it's the ketone part that gets reduced. But wait, A was a ketone, which upon reaction with HCN gives the cyanohydrin (B), which is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile. So,
