Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The question has two parts, each involving a different reaction leading to products A and B. I need to figure out which options (A to D) have the correct major products.

Let's start with the first reaction to find product A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, wait. BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things, maybe to form enolates or add to carbonyl groups. But wait, the starting molecule has an ether linkageâ€”specifically, a benzene ring with an OCH2CH2 group attached. Wait, no, wait, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that.

So the benzene ring has a substituent which is an OCH2 group. The O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. Let me see: 3-methylbut-2-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. But-2-enyl has the double bond between C2 and C3. So structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or something else? Wait, but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with double bond between C2 and C3? No, wait but I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but that would be but-1-enyl. Wait no, but-2-enyl would be CH2CH2 with the double bond between C2
