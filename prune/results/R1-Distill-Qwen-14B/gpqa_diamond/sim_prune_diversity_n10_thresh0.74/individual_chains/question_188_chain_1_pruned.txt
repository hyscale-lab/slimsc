Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal.

Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal. So, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along one axis, right? So that's like the length of a unit cell edge, a.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ), where h, k, l are the Miller indices. Oh wait, wait, no, I might have that formula wrong. Or is it d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + hl cos γ) )) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall. For a general crystal system, the interplanar spacing for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = a / √( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ )

Or is it that in a rhombohedral system, because all the angles are the same, the formula simplifies? Because in a cubic system, the formula is much simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But here, the angles are 30 degrees each.

So the given Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. So substituting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( 1² + 1² + 1² - 2(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Wait, let's compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, calculate the numerator inside the square root:

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

Now, the second part is 2 times the sum of hk cos α, kl cos β, hl cos gamma.

Each of h, k, l is 1, so each term is 1*1*1* cos30. Since all angles are 30, each term is cos30.

So the sum inside is 3 terms of cos30. So 3 * cos30.

Thus, the second part is 2*(3 * cos30) = 6 cos30.

So the entire denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 6 cos30.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + kl cos β + hl cos gamma ). So in our case, it's:

3 - 2*( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 )
