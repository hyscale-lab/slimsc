Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about measuring observables P and Q in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes.

First, let me understand the setup. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's normalized? Let me check. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm would be the square root of (1 + 4 + 1) = 6, so the square root of 6 is the norm. So the state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1) / sqrt(6).

Then there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
    [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
    [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

And Q is another 3x3 matrix:

Q = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, -1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The eigenstates would be the standard basis vectors.

Now, the question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but when you measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P, and similarly for Q. But what's the process here?

I think the steps are:

1. Measure P. The outcome is 0. So the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Then, measure Q on this new state. The outcome is -1. So we need the probability of this happening.

So first, find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

To find the eigenvalues, solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant of:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -λ]

Hmm, that might be a bit tricky, but perhaps I can compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I can guess the eigenvectors. Since P looks symmetric, perhaps it has some nice eigenvectors.

Wait, let's think: for a 3x3 matrix with such a pattern, perhaps the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Let me check if (1, 0, 1) is an eigenvector. Let me compute P*(1,0,1).

P*(1,0,1) =
