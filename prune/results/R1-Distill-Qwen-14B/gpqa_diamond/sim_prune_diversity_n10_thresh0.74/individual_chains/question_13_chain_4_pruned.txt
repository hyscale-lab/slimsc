Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit new to this.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and it's a bicyclic compound, right? Specifically, it's a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a cyclohexene ring. Oh wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but it's more specifically a bicyclic structure with a menthofuran skeleton? No, wait, I think limonene is a bicyclic compound with a specific configuration. Maybe I should draw its structure.

(R)-(+)-Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic system with a specific substituent arrangement. Alternatively, I think limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a cyclohexene ring. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic molecule, right? It has a structure similar to menthol but with a different substituent arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a bridged structure.

Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, correct. But more accurately, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. Let me think: the structure of limonene is a bicyclo structure, maybe bicyclo[2.2.
