Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on some spectroscopic data. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D accordingly.

Hmm, the given data includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says it's a very broad peak, which might suggest it's an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or something else with a broad O-H.

Then they have strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Wavenumbers in that region typically correspond to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1700 is more like a ketone or an ester, maybe. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C) stretching, but wait, no, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone? Because the 1650 might be a C=C in conjugation with a carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably not.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the H's on a double bond, like in an alkene or aromatic ring. So the compound probably has a double bond or aromatic protons. But in the IR, we have a broad peak which could be an alcohol, so maybe it's an allylic alcohol or something similar.

Then the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH2O? No, wait. Alternatively, 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) + 15 (O) + 15 (CH3) = wait, no, that's 45 for (CH3)2O, which is 30 (two CH3 and one O). Wait, wait, molecular formula for (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which has a molecular weight of 46 (12*2 +6 +16= 24+6=30+16=46). So 45 must be something else.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of something else. Let me think about the possible fragments. For example, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12) +10 + (16*2) =72+10+32=114. So when the compound breaks apart, maybe a fragment like C
