Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and found changes in the first exon. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

First, I need to understand what kind of mutations would disable the gene. Usually, disrupting the gene can be done by causing a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Frameshifts happen when the reading frame is altered, leading to a completely different downstream amino acid sequence, which often results in a nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, if a stop codon is introduced early, the protein synthesis stops, leading to a truncated and likely nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutants, I should compare their sequences to the intact gene to see where changes occurred and what kind of mutations they are.

The intact gene sequence is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:
The start is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1’s sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT... So let me see where the change is.

Looking at the first part: Intact is ATGTTTCTC... So positions after ATG (the start codon), the next few nucleotides. Let's count: 

Intact: positions 4-7 are TTT C (TTT is three Ts, then C). Mutant 1: positions 4-7 are TCT A. So the change is at position 4: T becomes C. Wait, let me check.

Wait, maybe it's better to line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT…TGA

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG CTG GTA CTT CTG TGT GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGC GC…TGA

Wait, maybe I should write the sequences in the same positions.

Intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Breaking it down:

The first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGG
