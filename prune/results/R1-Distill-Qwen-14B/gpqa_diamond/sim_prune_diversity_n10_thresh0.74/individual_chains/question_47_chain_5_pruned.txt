Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me. It's about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Starting with the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because amines or amides have strong absorption in that range. Wait, but the question is about the IR, so maybe it's an amide or an amine. The medium to strong intensity suggests maybe two different N-H groups? Or perhaps a single group with two stretches, like an amide which has two N-H bonds (but usually in amides, the N-H is a single peak around 3300 cm-1). Alternatively, maybe an amine with two different environments for the N-H groups, but that's less common. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1 which is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So possible functional groups include amides, esters, or maybe a formamide.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide has an amide group, so the N-H would show in IR. The carbonyl would also be present.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide is HCONR2. So the carbonyl is at 1720, which matches. The N-H would be around 3300, maybe a little higher. The ethoxy group would have its own IR features, like C-O stretch around 1100 cm-1 but I don't see those given here. But the given IR has 3420 and 3325, which might involve both the amide N-H and maybe an alcohol or something else? Wait, but the compound is a formamide, so probably only the N-H would be there.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This would have an amide group (from the phenylamine and the propionic acid). Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H
