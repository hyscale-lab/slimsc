Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. The question involves exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

So, there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets.

The key data given are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method's Doppler shift depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude formula might be useful here. The formula is something like K = (V) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (4π²)^(1/3) )) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * c )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the Doppler shift and the orbital period. I remember that the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(c)) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So that simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π c)) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But wait, how does K relate to the Doppler shift? I think the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to the velocity (
