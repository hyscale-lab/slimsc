Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

The setup is that they did a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockouts for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key thing is that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes by binding to their promoters and activating or repressing their transcription. 

The data they got from testing resistance to anthracnose is as follows:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% (so completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (so even worse than either g1 or g3 alone)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, the question says that the mutant plants have higher sensitivity if they can't produce certain gene products. So lower resistance means more susceptible.

I think I need to figure out the gene interactions here. Let's think about what each result implies.

First, the single mutants: 

g2 is completely susceptible. So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the fungus at all. That suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. Or maybe G2 is the only gene providing resistance, but that can't be because other mutants have some resistance. Wait, but g3 has 50% resistance, which is still lower than wild type but not zero. So, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3 and maybe others. Because if G2 isn't working, none of its downstream genes would be expressed, leading to susceptibility.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2 has 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as g2 alone. That suggests that G1's function is somehow dependent on G2. Because when G2 is already knocked out (g2), adding g1 doesn't make it any worse. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2. Or perhaps G1 is also regulated by G2.

g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So knocking out G3 in addition to G2 doesn't change the resistance. So the resistance is already at zero because G2 is knocked out. So G3's function must be downstream of G2, since G2's knockout is masking the effect of G3.

g1g3 is 10% resistance. So knocking out both G1 and G3 brings the resistance down from 75% (g1 alone) to 10% and from 50% (g3 alone) to 10%. Hmm, that's a bigger drop than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are working together or in parallel to contribute to resistance. 

Now, the question is about which gene is the transcription factor upstream. The info says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. Let's think about the possible relationships.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then it would regulate G1 and G3. Because in the single mutants, g2 is 0%, which is the most severe. Also, when G2 is not working, G1 and G3's functions are not expressed because their transcription is controlled by G2.

Wait, but g1 has 75% resistance. So without G1, they have 75% resistance. So G1 is contributing to resistance, but not as crucial as G2. Similarly, g3 has 50% resistance, so G3 is also contributing but less
