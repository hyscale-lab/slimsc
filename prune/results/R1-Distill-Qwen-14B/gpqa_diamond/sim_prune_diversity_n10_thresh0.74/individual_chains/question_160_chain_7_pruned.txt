Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, let's start breaking this down. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark fringes called the diffraction pattern. The shape of the aperture affects the intensity distribution. For example, a circular aperture has a central bright spot with rings around it, while a single slit has alternating bright and dark bands.

Wait, but in this case, the aperture is a polygon with N sides, and N approaches infinity. So as N becomes very large, the polygon would approximate a circle. Oh wait, but wait! The apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So in a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length and the number of sides.

But wait, if all apothems are the same, as N increases, the polygon tends towards a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N is infinite, the shape is a circle of radius 'a'. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon with a large number of sides, the apothem 'a' would be approximately the radius of the circle that the polygon approaches. So yes, when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a.

Wait, but then why would the problem state that N is infinitely large? Because in that case, the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture. So for a circular aperture, the far field diffraction pattern has a central bright spot, and the first dark ring (minimum) occurs at an angle θ given by the formula a sinθ =
