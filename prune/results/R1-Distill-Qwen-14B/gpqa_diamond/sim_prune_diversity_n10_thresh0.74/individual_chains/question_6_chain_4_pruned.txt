Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I remember that in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, the potential might split the problem into radial and angular parts. Oh wait, but sometimes potentials can be separable, which would make solving the Schrödinger equation easier.

Let me first rewrite the potential to see if I can separate it into functions of r and θ. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr²: V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Hmm, that might not immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps express cos²θ in terms of double angles? Because I remember that cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me try that substitution.

So, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Plugging that into V: V = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * (1/2)(1 + cos2θ). Let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)kr², the second part is (3/2)(1/2)kr² (1 + cos2θ) which is (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So adding the two terms:

(1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Let me compute 1/2 + 3/4: that's 2/4 +3/4 =5/4. So V = (5/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is in two dimensions. So perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Cartesian coordinates, but the potential is given in polar coordinates. Alternatively, maybe I can diagonalize the potential by a change of variables. Because sometimes, potentials that have terms like cos2θ can be expressed in terms of new coordinates, which might decouple the radial and angular parts.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is 

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂
