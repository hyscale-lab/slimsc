Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question about a synthesized peptide. Hmm, let's think through this.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So wait, normally for an alpha-proton in a peptide, you'd expect a single peak, right? But here, it's split into two. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not splitting due to neighboring protons. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Looking at the options, option C mentions 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I remember that sometimes, when forming amides, especially under certain conditions, double couplings can happen. Like, if the reaction is not clean, maybe the protons are coupling with more than one neighbor, but I'm not entirely sure how that would lead to two peaks. Or perhaps it's something about the stereochemistry of the amide formation?

Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Same mass implies they're the same molecular weight, which would suggest they're the same compound, maybe different forms. Hmm, same mass but two peaks. Since NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, maybe it's some kind of isomer. 

Option B suggests a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show two peaks if they're present. But in NMR, enantiomers have the same chemical shifts because they're mirror images. So if the molecule is chiral, but the NMR is seeing two peaks for the same proton, that wouldn't make sense because the enantiomers would look identical in the NMR. Unless they're diastereomers, which would have different chemical shifts.

Option D is diastereoisomers. If the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, their NMR would show different shifts for the same protons. But wait, in the NMR, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar shifts. So diastereomers might not match because their shifts would be different enough. Or maybe if the diastereomers are in a certain ratio, their peaks might overlap? But in the question, the NMR shows two distinct peaks for the same proton. So maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture, but I'm not sure.

Option A is contamination with a precursor. If that were the case, the LC-MS would show a peak for the precursor and the product. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule. So that's probably not it.

Back to the NMR problem. The two peaks for the same alpha proton, same shift, similar... but no coupling. Wait, same shift but two peaks? That could happen if the proton is split into a doublet due to coupling with another proton, but the question rules that out. So maybe it's not coupling but something else.

Wait, maybe it's about the stereochemistry in the molecule. If the molecule has some kind of stereocenter that leads to different environments for the alpha proton. But wait, how? If the molecule has more than one stereocenter, maybe it's a diastereomer. For example, if the alpha proton is in a different environment in the two diastereomers, their shifts might be similar but not the same, leading to two peaks. But in the question, the shifts are similar, so maybe they're so close that they're considered similar.

Wait, if the molecule exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each would have a slightly different environment for the alpha proton, leading to two peaks. But why would the shifts be so similar? Alternatively, maybe it's a mixture of enantiomers, but since enantiomers have identical NMR shifts, that wouldn't explain two peaks. So maybe the answer is diastereomers.

But wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. That suggests same molecular weight, so same molecular formula. So the two molecules would have to be enantiomers or diastereomers.

In the NMR, for diastereomers, the alpha proton's environment would be different, so they would split into two peaks. But if the diastereomers are in a racemic mixture, wait no, diastereomers aren't necessarily in equal amounts. But the question says the integrals are roughly equal, so each peak is about 0.5H each. So
