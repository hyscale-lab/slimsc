Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure out the probability of an atom decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, does that mean that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, or that the half-life is such that 32% decay in those 100 minutes? Oh wait, I think it's the former. So the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32 in decimal.

Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the probability of decay is independent of time. The decay probability per unit time is a constant. So the decay follows an exponential distribution. The formula I remember is the survival probability, which is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t. That's given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, the problem gives the decay probability for 100 minutes as 32%. So the survival probability after 100 minutes would be 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. So 0.68 equals e^(-λ * 100). Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -
