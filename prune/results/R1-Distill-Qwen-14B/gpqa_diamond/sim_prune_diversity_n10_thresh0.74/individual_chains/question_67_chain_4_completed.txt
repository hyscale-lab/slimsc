Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem states that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we're focusing solely on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1,1,2,-1⟩. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for particle 1 and 2, respectively. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of that total.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z eigenvalues as -ħ. The options are A through D, with D being 0, which catches my attention because I remember something about quantum states and measurement probabilities.

Wait, let me think about the state given. The state is |1,1,2,-1⟩. So each electron has l=1, which makes sense for a p orbital. The total angular momentum l is 2, so that's the sum of 1+1. The m is -1, which is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

Now, I need to find the probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ. Since each L_z for an electron with l=1 has possible eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So each L_z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

But wait, the state is a coupled state, which probably is a combination of the product states of individual angular momenta. So, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩ is a combination of |l₁,m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂,m₂⟩ such that when you add them, the total l and m are 2 and -1.

I remember that when combining angular momenta, the total state is built from the product states. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. The state |l₁ l₂; L M⟩ is a linear combination of |l₁ m₁⟩ |l₂ m₂⟩ where m₁ + m₂ = M.

In this case, M is -1. So, for the total state |1,1,2,-1⟩, the product states that contribute must have m₁ + m₂ = -1. So the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1,-0), (-0, -1), but let me list all possibilities where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

Each particle has m₁ and m₂ can be -1, 0, +1. So the pairs are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1

(0, -1) → sum -1

Are there any others? Let's see: (-2,-1?) No, because each m can't be less than -1. So only two possible pairs contribute to M = -1.

Wait, but wait, when combining two l=1 states, the possible total L are 0,1,2. Here, we're considering L=2, which is the maximum possible.

The state |1,1,2,-1⟩ would be a combination of the product states |1,m₁⟩|1,m₂⟩ with m₁ + m₂ = -1.

But how are the coefficients determined? I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2.

The general state |l1 l2; L M⟩ is a sum over m1, m2 of [Clebsch-Gordan coefficients] * |l1 m1⟩|l2 m2⟩.

So for L=2 and M=-1, the terms in the sum would be when m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1), as I thought.

But wait, wait. Because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients might have certain relationships. For L=2 and M=-1, how do these product states add up?

I think the state |1,1,2,-1⟩ would be an eigenstate where the only possible m₁ and m₂ states that contribute are these two. But the coefficients might be such that the state is a sum of these two product states with certain coefficients.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the expansion of |1,1,2,-1⟩ in terms of the product states.

Alternatively, perhaps for L=2 and M=-1, the state is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of the two particles, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, in this case, the orbital angular momentum is considered, and electrons are fermions, but because we're considering orbital angular momentum (excluding spin), which is symmetric under exchange, perhaps. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things, but perhaps in this case, the orbital part is symmetric, but the spin part is antisymmetric.

Wait, but the question says to ignore the spin, so perhaps the combined state is symmetric in orbital angular momentum. I'm not sure if that's relevant here, but maybe it will come into play when considering the possible product states.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the problem.

The problem is asking for the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z are measured to be -ħ. So, each of the two electrons would have L₁z = -ħ and L₂z = -ħ.

So, in the product state, for each electron, their m would be -1, because L_z |l,m⟩ = mħ |l,m⟩. So, m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1. So, their product state would be |m₁=-1, m₂=-1⟩, which would sum to m = -2. But wait, the total m here is -1, not -2. So that's a problem.

Because in the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ = |1,1,2,-1⟩, the sum of individual m's is m = -1. So, if each m₁ and m₂ is -1, their sum would be -2, which doesn't match M = -1. So, the product state |m₁=-1, m₂=-1⟩ is not part of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩.

Wait a minute, that's the key here. Because the coupled state only includes product states where m₁ + m₂ = M = -1. So, any product state where m₁ + m₂ isn't -1 isn't part of the state we're considering.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1⟩ is built from product states where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because those sum to -1.

If both m₁ and m₂ are -1, then m1+m2 = -2, which is not part of the coupled state we're given. So, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩ is not present in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1⟩.

Therefore, when we make a measurement of L₁z and L₂z, the possible outcomes would only arise from the product states that are part of the coupled state. So, the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

In other words, the only possible outcomes are when one electron has m= -1 and the other has m=0. So, in any case, you can't have both m₁ and m₂ being -1. Hence, the probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ is zero.

Wait, but just to be thorough, perhaps I should write out the state.

The coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩ can be written as a linear combination of |1, m₁⟩|1, m₂⟩ where m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So, the expansion would be:

|1,1,2,-1⟩ = √(something) [ |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ]

Wait, but the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 are needed. Let me recall the expansion.

The general formula for combining two angular momenta l1 and l2 into L:

|l1 l2; L M⟩ = sum_{m1, m2} [ [ CG coefficients ] |l1 m1⟩|l2 m2⟩ ]

The CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I think the CG coefficient for M=-1 would involve the two terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

The coefficients can be found from tables or from the properties of CG coefficients. For example, for L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

The exact coefficients might not be necessary here because we're only interested in whether the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩ is present. From the sum, it's clear that it's not included because m1 + m2 in that case would be -2, which doesn't match M=-1.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1⟩ doesn't include the product state where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, when you make a measurement of L₁z and L₂z, the outcomes can't both be -ħ because that would require m1 = m2 = -1, which isn't part of the state.

Therefore, the probability of both electrons having L₁z and L₂z eigenvalues of -ħ is zero.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

For an electron in a p orbital ($l=1$), the possible eigenvalues of $L_{z}$ are $-\hbar$, $0$, and $+\hbar$. Thus, the product state corresponding to $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ would be $|m_1=-1\rangle|m_2=-1\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the z-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. However, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is a linear combination of product states where $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The only possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy this condition are $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$. 

The product state $|m_1=-1\rangle|m_2=-1\rangle$ is not included in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ because it corresponds to $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$. Therefore, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain any component where both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $-\hbar$. 

Since the product state $|m_1=-1\rangle|m_2=-1\rangle$ is absent from the coupled state, the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.
