Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Where β is 1/(kT). So each state contributes a term based on its energy.

First, I think I need to figure out all the possible states the system can be in. Since each spin has two possible values, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So there are 8 states in total.

Wait, each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3. So each can be +1 or -1. I'll probably have to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then compute the sum of exp(-β E) for each.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since all the spins are symmetric, perhaps I can group states by their energy. That way, I don't have to calculate each one individually.

Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So the energy depends on the product of each pair of spins.

Let me think about the possible values of each term S_i S_j. Each S_i is either +1 or -1. So S_i S_j can be 1 (if both are same) or -1 (if different).

So each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either 1 or -1. The sum inside the brackets is the sum of these three terms. Let's call this sum Q = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So E = -J Q.

Wait, since each of S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1, the sum Q can take on certain values. What are the possible values of Q?

Let me list possible Q values. Since each term is either +1 or -1, adding three terms.

Possible sums:

If all three products are +1, Q=3.

If two are +1 and one is -1, Q=2 + (-1) =1.

If one is +1 and two are -1, Q= -1.

If all three are -1, Q= -3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let's consider all possible combinations.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the possible Q values.

Wait, another approach: the sum Q = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me compute this for all possible 8 states.

But that might take time, but perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the number of states that have a particular Q value.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where the sum Q can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Because each term in Q can be either +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

But how many states correspond to each Q value?

Let me think about the possible cases.

Case 1: Q=3. That happens when all three terms are +1. So S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1.

From S1S2=1, S1=S2.

From S1S3=1, S1=S3.

So S2=S3 as well. Thus all three spins are the same. So either all +1 or all -1.

So how many states have Q=3?

Only two states: all spins +1, or all -1.

So number of states with Q=3 is 2.

Each contributes to the partition function with exp(-β E).

Since E = -J Q, when Q=3, E = -J *3. So the exponent is β*(-E) = β*(3J).

So each of these two states contributes exp(3Jβ) each. So their total contribution is 2 exp(3Jβ).

Case 2: Q = -3. All three terms are -1.

So S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1.

So S1 = -S2, S1 = -S3, S2 = -S3.

Which implies S1=-S2, and S2=-S3. So S1 = S3.

So for this case, all spins are opposite in pairs. So S1 = -S2, S2 = -S3, so S1 = S3. So S1, S2, S3 must be in the order +1, -1, +1 or -1, +1, -1.

Wait, so how many such states are there?

Each state must have S1 = -S2, S2 = -S3. So for example, S1 = +1 → S2 = -1 → S3 = +1.

Similarly, S1 = -1 → S2=+1 → S3=-1.

So two states here. So number of states with Q=-3 is 2.

Each contributes exp(-β E) → E = -J*(-3) = 3J. So -β E is -3Jβ.

So for each state, the exponent is exp(3Jβ), same as case 1.

Wait
