Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Because if it's a broad peak, it's probably hydrogen-bonded, so maybe a carbonyl group like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, 1700 is high, so that's probably a carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic C=C stretch, like in a conjugated system. Or maybe an amide, but since the options don't include N, probably not that. So maybe it's an ester group, which has two carbonyls? No, esters have one carbonyl. Wait, another possibility: maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or maybe a conjugated ester. Alternatively, 1650 could be a carbonyl with some conjugation, like an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Hmm.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has at least one double bond. Maybe it's an aromatic ring, but since the IR didn't show a strong absorption around 1500 that's typically for aromatic C-H, but that might not be the case here. Or perhaps it's an isolated double bond, like in an ester or ketone group with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion (m/z=91) is a benzene ring, but wait, 45 is the mass for something like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, no, acetone's molecular ion is 58. Hmm. Wait, the fragment at 45 could correspond to (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe a CH2O group. Alternatively, another thought: 45 is also the mass for the acylium ion, like RCO+ where R is something. Or maybe a ketene fragment?

Wait, let me think. The molecular formula options are all C6H... So the molecular weight would be:

C6H12O2: (12*6)+(1*12)+(16*2)=72+12+32=116.
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98.
C6H10O2:72+10+32=114.
C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

But wait, the mass spec shows m/z=45. So that's a fragment, not the molecular ion. So the molecular ion would be higher. So what could give a fragment of 45?

Another approach: the molecular formula options.

Looking at the options, the possible functional groups could be esters, ketones, alcohols, maybe acids.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests either an alcohol (OH) or a carboxylic acid (COOH). But the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1 complicate things. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H would be very broad. So that fits. Alternatively, an ester has a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and an ether (but that doesn't show up in IR as strong absorption). Wait, but in esters, the carbonyl is around 1720-1750. So 1700 is a bit lower, maybe indicating a conjugated carbonyl or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 peak might be an aromatic ring, like C=C stretch. If
