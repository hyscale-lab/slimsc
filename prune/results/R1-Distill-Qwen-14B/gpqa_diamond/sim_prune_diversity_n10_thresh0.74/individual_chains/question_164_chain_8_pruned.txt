Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, there are some radial velocity observations. For system_1, the stars have RV variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The masses are the sum of the two stars in each system.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The radial velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses and the orbital period. 

Wait, the formula I think is something like K = (v) is proportional to (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2), but I might be mixing up the details. Or maybe it's K = (2Ï€ G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i)/( (P (M1 + M2))^(2/3) )) or something like that. Also, I think the maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude) of each star depends on the mass of the other star and the system's total mass. 

Wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, right? So the star with the larger mass has a smaller velocity because it's moving less around the center of mass. So the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of that star. 

Let me think. For a binary system, each star's velocity is proportional to the mass of the other star divided by the total mass. So if M1 is the mass of star 1 and M2 is star 2, then the RV semi-amplitude K1 for star 1 would be proportional to (M2) / (M1 + M2), and K2 would be (M1)/(M1+M2). Wait, but that's when both stars have the
