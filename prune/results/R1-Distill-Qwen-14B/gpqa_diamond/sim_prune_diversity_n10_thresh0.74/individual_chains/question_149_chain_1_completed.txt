Okay, so I have this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that the 1H NMR of a crude peptidic compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So that suggests it's one proton but split into two signals. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, which usually causes splitting. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, in NMR, if a proton is split into multiple signals, it's usually due to coupling with neighboring nuclei. But if the splitting isn't from coupling, maybe it's something else. Oh, maybe it's because of a diastereomer or enantiomer. But how does that affect NMR?

If the compound is a racemic mixture, you'd have enantiomers. But enantiomers don't usually split NMR signals because they have the same environment. Unless maybe the coupling is to another chiral center, but the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not enantiomers.

Alternatively, diastereomers would have different environments, so their NMR signals would split. But wait, the integral adds up to 1H, which is the expected amount. So perhaps it's a pair of diastereomers where the alpha-proton is in a different environment but the same number of protons in each. So each diastereomer would contribute one peak, making two peaks in total.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests two different compounds with the same molecular weight. Since the MS is the same, they must have the same molecular formula, so they're isomers. Diastereomers would fit because they have same molecular formula but different physical properties, so would elute at different times in LC.

So the options are between B and D. B says enantiomers, D says diastereomers. But enantiomers have same MS, same retention time? Wait, no, in LC, chiral columns can separate enantiomers, but if the LC doesn't have a chiral column, they might co-elute. But the question says two peaks of equal intensity, so maybe the LC is a normal column that doesn't separate enantiomers. Hmm. Or maybe the compound itself has a chiral center causing it to have different retention times.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If the compound is a diastereomer, the environment would change. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would be in a different environment, leading to different chemical shifts. But wait, when you have diastereomers, each would have a set of protons, and if one is an alpha-proton in a different configuration, then you'd get two signals. But why would they be similar in shift and same integral? Maybe if the diastereomers are in a certain configuration where the alpha-proton is equivalent in each case. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the diastereomers have the same coupling environment for that proton, but that's unlikely.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is that the compound hasn't fully formed, and there's some byproduct. The MS shows same mass, so same molecular weight. Another possibility is that it's a racemic mixture but the NMR is being observed in a solution that's not chiral. But no, racemic mixtures don't split the signals into two. They just give a single peak because the protons are in the same environment.

Alternatively, could it be a case of double coupling, like in an amide bond forming? The option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not as familiar with that. But if the amide bond forms, perhaps the proton is involved in more than one coupling, but the question already rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe that's not the case.

Another possibility is that the sample hasn't been purified, so there's a precursor and the desired product. The MS would show two peaks, each with same mass as each other but perhaps different from the product. But wait, the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So the two peaks are for the same mass, so same molecular formula. So it's not a precursor and product because the precursor would have a different mass (like higher, if it's a starting material that lost something to become the product). So option A is probably not the case.

So back to B and D. Let me think about diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC. Their NMR peaks would have different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks for the same proton have similar shifts. If the two diastereomers have the same environment for that alpha-proton, but I'm not sure that's possible. Or maybe each diastereomer has two alpha-protons that are equivalent, but that's not the case here because the question says the same alpha-proton. Hmm, maybe each diastereomer contributes one peak, so two peaks for the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer. But that doesn't quite fit because the integral adds to 1H. Maybe each diastereomer has a single alpha-proton but in different environments, leading to two peaks.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diastereomer mixture, so the NMR shows two peaks for that proton. The integral sums to 1H because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, each diastereomer has one proton, and in the mixture, each is present in equal amount, so each contributes a peak adding up to 1H.

But in that case, the NMR would show two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H, but the question says that each has roughly equal integrals and together sum to 1H. So that fits. So the two peaks are each for 0.5H, but the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer.

So the reasoning is: the compound is a mixture of diastereomers (D), which explains the NMR (same proton in different environments, so two peaks) and LC-MS (peaks same mass, two diastereomers with same molecular formula, so same mass, but different retention times).


The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (summing to 1H), and no spin-spin coupling as a cause for the splitting. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):**  
   A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight, leading to distinct peaks in LC-MS. However, the question specifies that both peaks have the same mass, ruling out this explanation.

2. **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):**  
   Enantiomers have identical physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts, and would not produce separate peaks in LC-MS unless a chiral column is used. The question does not indicate the use of a chiral column, and the NMR data shows two distinct peaks, making this unlikely.

3. **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):**  
   While "double coupling" could theoretically cause two peaks, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. This makes this option implausible.

4. **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):**  
   Diastereomers have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR signals and different retention times in LC. The NMR data supports this explanation, as the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton in different environments (diastereomers), with integrals summing to 1H. The LC-MS data also aligns, as diastereomers have the same molecular formula and mass but different physical properties, causing two peaks of equal intensity.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, consistent with the NMR and LC-MS observations.
