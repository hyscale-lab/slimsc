Okay, so I've got this question here about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles equal too. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think it's calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices. The formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cosα) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosγ) ), but wait, wait, isn't there a different formula when the angles are all the same? Because in a rhombohedral system, a, b, c are equal, and alpha, beta, gamma are equal as well. So maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but for a rhombohedral, since the angles are not 90 degrees, it's a bit more complicated. Oh, right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d = (1/√( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )) ) * a

But wait, in rhombohedral, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So that simplifies things. Let me plug in the numbers.

The Miller indices here are (1,1,1). So h=1, k=1, l=1.

So let's compute the denominator first. Let's calculate h² +k² +l² which is 1+1+1=3.

Then the other terms: 2(hk cos γ) is 2*(1)(1)*cos(30 degrees). Cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.
