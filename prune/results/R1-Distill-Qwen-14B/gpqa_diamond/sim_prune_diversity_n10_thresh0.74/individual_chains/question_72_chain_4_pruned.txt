Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what each part does and figure out the final product's structure, then count the distinct hydrogens.

The question involves several reactions, so I'll go through each step one by one.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That bicyclo structure is like norbornene, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

This compound is then combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction because the starting material has a diene (bicyclo with two double bonds, so maybe the diene is the conjugated diene part?), and the other reactant is a dienophile. Wait, but the dienophile usually has a double bond, but this other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, so the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the diene, and the bicyclo compound must be the dienophile? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. The diene is conjugated, and the dienophile is something like a ketone, ester, or another diene. Wait, but both reactants have dienes. Maybe the bicyclo compound is acting as the dienophile here. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I don't think that's common under thermal conditions. Or perhaps it's a [2+4] between a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents on carbons 5 and 6â€”each is a dibromomethyl group. So that's CH2Br2 on each of those positions. Hmm, and the starting material is 7-(tert-buto
