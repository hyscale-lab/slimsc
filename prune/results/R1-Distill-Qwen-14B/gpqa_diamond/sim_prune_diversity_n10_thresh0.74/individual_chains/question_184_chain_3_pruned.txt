Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, in benzene rings, numbering starts such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, the arrangement must be such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in position 1, and nitro in position 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The numbering would be such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, if the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, that's the lowest. So, the structure must have the tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3, and ethoxy at position 1. But wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the order of reactions and where each group gets added. Because the order of substitution directs where the next group comes in.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, nitro. Let's think about their directing effects. Tert-butyl is a strong activating group (because it's an alkyl group) and is ortho/para directing. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group) and it's also ortho/para directing. Nitro is a deactivating, meta directing group.

Wait, but wait, the nitro group is meta directing because it's a strong deactivating (due to the -NO2 group). So, when adding substituents, their directing effects will influence where the next group goes.

But in our target molecule, the substituents are in specific positions. So, I need to plan the order of reactions so that each group is added in the correct position relative to the others.

Let me consider the possible steps. Starting with benzene. The possible reactions include nitration, sulfonation (which can be used as a protecting group sometimes), alkylation (like Friedel-Crafts), and elimination (like using H2SO4 and heat for dehydration, or using things like NaNO2 and HCl for diazotization, which is typically for substitution reactions, like in the Sandmeyer reaction or similar).

Wait, but the target has nitro, ethoxy, and tert-butyl. Let me think about the order in which these groups can be added. Let's think about whether the nitro group is added early or late.

If I add nitro first, then benzene would have a nitro group. Nitro is meta directing, so the next substituent would go in the meta position relative to it. Then, adding another group would go in another position.

Alternatively, adding the activating groups first might be better because they make the ring more reactive, making subsequent reactions easier.

Wait, but nitration is a strong deactivating step. If I nitrate benzene first, the ring becomes less reactive
