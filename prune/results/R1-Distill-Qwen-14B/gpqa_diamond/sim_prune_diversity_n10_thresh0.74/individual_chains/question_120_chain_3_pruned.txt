Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, what do I know about parallax? Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky relative to more distant stars when observed from different points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to distance: plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's farther away has a smaller parallax.

Now, the question says the stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space, so the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. So if you look at a certain volume of space, you'll find the same number of stars regardless of where that volume is located.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars fall into a small range of parallax values as that range changes. Let me rephrase: how does N, the number of stars, depend on the parallax plx when considering a small change in plx, say Δplx.

I think I need to relate the number of stars in a certain parallax range to their actual distances. Since parallax plx is 1/d, the distance d is 1/plx. So a range of parallax Δplx corresponds to a range of distances. Let me figure out how that translates.

Suppose I have a small change in parallax, Δplx. What does that mean for the corresponding change in distance? Let's think of plx as a function of distance, plx = 1/d. So if I increase plx by Δplx, the change in distance Δd can be found using calculus. Or maybe a simpler approach, considering that for small changes, plx is approximately 1/(d + Δd) ≈ 1/d - (Δd)/d². So the change in plx is Δplx ≈ (Δd)/d². Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this to find Δd in terms of Δplx and d. That would be Δd ≈ d² * Δplx. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So for a given plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. Now, a small change in plx (Δplx) would correspond to a small change in distance (Δd). Let's use differentials to relate Δplx and Δd. So, differentiating both sides, d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So Δplx ≈ - (1/d²) Δd. Hmm, but I'm looking for the relationship between the ranges, not the differentials. But perhaps using calculus can help express the number distribution.

So, the number of stars in a given distance range depends on the volume of a spherical shell of radius d and thickness Δd. The volume of such a shell is 4πd² Δd. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. So N ∝ 4πd² Δd. 

But since we want to express this in terms of parallax, which is 1/d, let's substitute d = 1/plx. Then d² would be (1/plx)^2, and Δd would be the change in distance corresponding to a change in plx. Wait, but earlier I found that Δd ≈ d² Δplx. Because from plx ≈ 1/(d + Δd) ≈ 1/d - Δd/(d²), so Δplx ≈ - Δd/(d²) → Δd ≈ -d² Δplx. But since we're dealing with absolute changes, I can ignore the sign for now.

So Δd ≈ d² Δplx. Substituting d = 1/plx, Δd
