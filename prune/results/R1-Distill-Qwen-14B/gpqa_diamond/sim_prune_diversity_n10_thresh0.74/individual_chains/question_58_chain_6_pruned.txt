Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when energy levels are high. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite quantities that pop up in calculations. So regularization helps make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff, for example. But which theories don't need this?

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. String theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's a candidate for a theory that unites quantum mechanics with general relativity. Since it's a theory that includes gravity, maybe it doesn't have the same kinds of divergences as other quantum field theories? Or does it? Wait, superstring theory incorporates supersymmetry and strings, so I think it predicts that all forces are unified. But does it require regularization? I'm not too sure. Maybe it doesn't because it's a theory that's supposed to be finite, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small. So perturbative methods work well there. But even so, when you do calculations in QCD, especially in lower energies, you might get divergences. So they probably use regularization methods like lattice regularization or others to handle these infinities. So B requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has been very successful, but it does have issues with divergences. For example, when calculating the self-energy of an electron, you get infinities. So they use regularization techniques, like the Pauli-Villars method or dimensional regularization. So C requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical means it doesn't include quantum mechanics. So in the classical realm, do we have divergences? Like, in the classical theory, when you calculate things like the electric field of a point charge, you get infinities at the origin. But in classical physics, how do they handle that? Well
