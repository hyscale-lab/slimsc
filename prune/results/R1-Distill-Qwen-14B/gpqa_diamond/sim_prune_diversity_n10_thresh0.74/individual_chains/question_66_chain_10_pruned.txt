Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, what do I remember about SMEFT? It's a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale. These operators are organized by their dimensionality, starting from dimension six. But why are symmetries important here?

I know that the Standard Model (SM) itself respects certain symmetries. The SMEFT should respect the same symmetries as the SM because it's an effective theory that incorporates the SM as the low-energy limit. So whatever symmetries the SM has, SMEFT must preserve in its operators.

Wait, but wait. The SM doesn't include gravity, so it doesn't really have Poincare symmetry as a fundamental symmetry? Or does it? Hmm, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely something the SM respects. So SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry as well.

What about Poincare symmetry (option 2)? Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations. The SM's Lagrangian is invariant under Poincare symmetry because it's a local symmetry. Wait, noâ€”wait. The SM includes terms like the gauge fields, which have kinetic terms that are Lorentz-invariant, and the matter fields also transform properly. But does the SM Lagrangian include all the necessary terms to make the entire theory Poincare invariant? I think so because the action is Poincare invariant, meaning the integrals over spacetime are invariant under these transformations. So SMEFT operators should also respect Poincare symmetry. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Next, CP symmetry (option 3). The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. For example, CP violation is observed in the kaon system. So if the SM doesn't have CP symmetry, then the SMEFT doesn't have to either. In fact, operators in SMEFT can violate CP, which is why they can be used to model beyond the SM physics like CP violation in processes where the SM doesn't provide it. So I don't think CP symmetry is a must for SMEFT operators. So option 3 is not a required symmetry; the operators don't have to respect it. So 3 is out.

What about CPT symmetry (option 4)? CPT is a big one. I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories that are Lorentz invariant must also respect CPT symmetry. Because of the way the symmetries interact, especially in a relativistic QFT. For example, the spin-statistics theorem comes into play here, and without CPT, you might have issues. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT. So option 4 is a must.

So putting it all together, which symmetries are required? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a minute. I thought Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So do I have to include both 1 and 2, or just 2?

Wait, the question is asking which "must be respected by all operators". Poincare is a larger symmetry, so if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is asking which symmetries must be respected. So perhaps the correct approach is to think which symmetries are individually required, regardless of each other.

Wait, but SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because it's built upon the SM, which is Lorentz-invariant. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But is Poincare symmetry required? Because Poincare includes both translations and Lorentz. The SM and SMEFT are formulated in a way that the action is Poincare-invariant. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So are both 1 and 2 required, or only 2?

Wait, I think that in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed in such a way that the entire Lagrangian is Poincare-invariant. So each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, meaning it must transform correctly under both Lorentz and translations. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. But if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. So in the question, if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. But the problem is whether the operators
