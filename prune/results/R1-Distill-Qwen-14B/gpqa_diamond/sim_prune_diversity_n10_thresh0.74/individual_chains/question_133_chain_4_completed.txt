Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. Oh wait, cm³ is the same as mL, right? So the volume is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4●2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is room temperature, so standard conditions probably apply.

The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution. The options are all in the order of 1e-7 M, so it's a pretty dilute solution.

I remember that orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, and the acid forms are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The solution here probably involves a buffer because we have two different phosphate salts. Since the solution contains both KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^- when dissolved) and Na2HPO4 (which is HPO4^2-), they must form a buffer solution. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, and they are usually made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

The key thing for buffers is to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates pH to the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and the acid. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), where A^- is the conjugate base and HA is the acid.

In this case, the relevant pKa would be the one that corresponds to the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- pair. Looking at the given Ka values for H3PO4:

Ka1 = 7.5e-3 (H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+)
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 (H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+)
Ka3 = 1.8e-12 (HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+)

So, the second dissociation is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. Therefore, the pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is approximately 7.207 (since pKa = -log(Ka)). Wait, let me calculate that: log(6.2e-8) is about 7.207 (because 1e-7 is 7, 1e-8 is 8, so 6.2e-8 would be 7.207).

Wait, no, wait. pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 6.2e-8 is log as 8 - 0.792 = 7.208? No, wait. Wait, the log of 6.2e-8 is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.792 + (-8) = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, I don't know the pH yet. Hmm, that's a problem. The question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. Oh, wait, but in a buffer solution, the concentrations are determined by the amounts of the acid and conjugate base.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- because I know the moles of each from the masses given.

Let me think about that. First, compute the moles of each component.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molecular weight. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 136.09 is approximately 136.1. 1/136.1 is about 0.00733 moles. Let me compute it more accurately.

136.09 is 136.09, so 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.007334 moles. Let me double-check: 136 * 0.007333 is about 1.00. So, approximately 0.007334 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4●2H2O: the mass is 1.00 g, molecular weight 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005608 mol.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. 177.99 is approximately 178. So 1/178 is about 0.005618. Hmm, but let's get precise.

177.99 is 177.99. Let me compute 1 / 177.99. Let's see, 177.99 is about 178, so 1/178 ≈ 0.005618. So 1.00 g is 0.005618 moles.

So, moles of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) is 0.007334 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) is 0.005618 mol.

But wait, since these are in the same solution, the concentrations will be based on the volume. The volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 liters.

So, concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007334 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

Wait, but that's without considering any reactions. Since the solution is a buffer, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium, but the concentrations are determined by the initial amounts because the buffer solution is based on that.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But I don't know the pH. Wait, but I don't think I need the pH to find the concentration of HPO4^2-. Let me think. Wait, the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, but wait. If the solution is a buffer, the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in equilibrium, and the ratio is determined by the pH, which in turn depends on the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations. But perhaps I can find the pH from the given information and then use that to find the concentration ratio.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the pH. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the buffer equation to find the ratio of the concentrations, and then find HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is giving the moles of each, and the volume, so the concentrations are already known. But then why would the pKa be given?

Wait, perhaps the solution is more complicated. Let's think about the dissociation of H3PO4.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+. The third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+.

In the solution, we have both H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So if I know the pH, I can compute the ratio. But I don't know the pH. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the pH using the initial concentrations, but that would require knowing the concentrations of H+ ions, which depends on the buffer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH based on the given concentrations because the solution is a buffer, and then use that to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], which is given by the moles of each divided by the same volume, so their ratio is (moles HPO4^2-)/(moles H2PO4^-).

Wait, moles HPO4^2- is 0.005618, H2PO4^- is 0.007334. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.005618 / 0.007334 ≈ 0.766.

So log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So, pH = pKa2 + (-0.114) = 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but how does that help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, actually, the concentrations are already determined based on the moles and volume. Because for H2PO4^-: 0.007334 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

HPO4^2-: 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.02809 M. But wait, the options are on the order of 1e-7 M, which is much lower. So something's wrong here.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. 0.028 M is much larger than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, but perhaps under the conditions, some of it dissociates further.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't a buffer because the amounts of the two salts are different. Or perhaps I'm misapplying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH first and then see if that affects the concentration. Let me try that.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] as 0.02809 and 0.03667, respectively.

So their ratio is 0.02809 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766, as before.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

But then, what's the concentration of HPO4^2-? Well, it's 0.02809 M, which is way higher than any option's 1e-7 M.

Wait, that can't be right, so I must be missing something. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility. The problem is about orthophosphate ions, which can refer to both HPO4^2- and PO4^3-, but the main species in solution would be HPO4^2- because it's a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, maybe the solution requires considering the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions. Because, in solution, HPO4^2- can react with water, dissociating into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, because HPO4^2- is a weak base, it can accept protons. The third dissociation step is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+; the Ka for that is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- would produce some PO4^3- and H+.

So, when considering the concentration of HPO4^2-, I need to account for the fact that it partially dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, so maybe the HPO4^2- is in equilibrium with PO4^3- and H+.

So perhaps the solution is, in fact, a buffer between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-? No, because the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-, but if it's in solution, it can dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again.

We have a solution with KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4 (and its water of crystallization) dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

These two can form a buffer, so the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but perhaps the solution's pH is such that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the problem statement says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, so the question is about [HPO4^2-].

But if the solution's pH is lower than the pKa3 of HPO4^2- (which is 12, roughly), then HPO4^2- will be the dominant species, and PO4^3- will be negligible. But wait, the pKa3 is 12, so if the solution's pH is around 7, which it would be because pKa2 is around 7.2, then HPO4^2- is in a buffer with H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the [HPO4^2-] is given by the ratio of the amounts. So in that case, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M, but that's way higher than any of the options given.

So I must be missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me redo that.

First, KH2PO4: 1.00 g. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.007334 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Wait, but wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O. The formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, yes, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005618 mol.

So in 200 mL (0.2 L), the concentrations are:

H2PO4^-: 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

HPO4^2-: 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.766) → 7.208 + (-0.114) = 7.094.

But the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is 0.028 M, but the answer options are in 1e-7 M. So this suggests that perhaps I'm miscalculating something, or the approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the solution is not just a buffer, but that the HPO4^2- itself can dissociate, thus reducing its concentration. Because even though the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, some of the HPO4^2- might dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So, to account for this, I need to consider the third dissociation step as well. The equation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka for this is 1.8e-12, which is very small. So the extent of dissociation would be small, but maybe it's enough to affect the concentration.

So, let's model this. Let me denote:

Let the initial concentration of HPO4^2- be C. We'll call this initial concentration as 0.02809 M. But some of it dissociates into PO4^3- and H+.

Let x be the concentration of HPO4^2- that dissociates. So, the change would be:

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 - x.

[PO4^3-] = x.

[H+] = x (since only one H+ is released per HPO4^2-).

The Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So, (x)(x)/(0.02809 - x) = 1.8e-12.

Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02809, we can approximate 0.02809 - x ≈ 0.02809.

So, x² ≈ 1.8e-12 * 0.02809 → x² ≈ 5.056e-14 → x ≈ sqrt(5.056e-14) ≈ 7.11e-7 M.

So, [PO4^3-] is 7.11e-7 M.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So, if some HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-, then the actual [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 - x. But x is 7.11e-7, which is negligible compared to 0.02809 (since 7e-7 is much smaller than 0.028). So, the concentration of HPO4^2- remains approximately 0.02809 M. But this is still way higher than the options given, so something's wrong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. What's the correct approach here?

Alternative approach: Maybe the solution is not a buffer. Wait, no, because we have two different phosphate species. So buffer is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is considering only the dissociation of HPO4^2- without considering the buffer. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not a buffer because of the presence of other factors. Or maybe I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3-, but the question says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the fact that the phosphate species exist in multiple forms, and the problem requires me to find the total concentration of HPO4^2-, taking into account the dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution is at the second dissociation step, and that the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH of the solution, which is determined by the buffer.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but the options are on the order of 1e-7 M. So, that's way off. So, I'm definitely missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of the phosphate ions in the solution, considering that both the initial phosphate species (KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4) are in solution, but perhaps they form a different equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is considering the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions in a way that the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the Ka3 value.

Wait, let me think again. The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which means the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But in solution, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8), and HPO4^2- can lose another proton to form PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).

But in this case, the solution's pH is determined by the buffer formed by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the initial approach gave [HPO4^2-] as 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the pH of the solution.

Wait, maybe I should compute the pH of the solution using the buffer equation, then compute the concentration of HPO4^2- under that pH.

Wait, the buffer equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We have the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- from the initial amounts, so we can compute the pH as I did earlier, approximately 7.094.

Now, considering the third dissociation step, HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+, with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

So, at pH 7.094, what is the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, the pH is lower than the pKa3 (which is around 12), so HPO4^2- will mainly be present, and PO4^3- will be minimal. So, the concentration of HPO4^2- should be approximately 0.028 M, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3- instead? But the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution where both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O are present, and the solution is at pH where HPO4^2- is the major species, but the concentration is determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because the initial calculation gives [HPO4^2-] much higher than the options, so perhaps I'm calculating the moles incorrectly.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the given masses are in milligrams, but the question says grams. Let me check.

No, the problem says 1.00 g each. So 1 gram each.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the molar masses:

KH2PO4: K is ~39.1, H2 is ~2.02, P is ~30.97, O4 is 16*4=64. So total is 39.1 + 2.02 +30.97 +64= 136.09 g/mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is ~22.99 each, so 2*22.99 =45.98. HPO4^2- is H (1), P (30.97), O4 (64) → HPO4 is 95.97 g/mol. But wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So the molar mass is (2*22.99) + (95.97) + (2*(2*1.008 + 16)) ) → 45.98 +95.97 + (2*(18))= 45.98 +95.97 +36= 178. So the given 177.99 g/mol is correct.

So, moles are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-? But the question says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total concentration of all phosphate species, but that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, and then the orthophosphate comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

Wait, that's possible. Let me think.

In solution, H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+ via the Ka2 value.

So, the initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M, and HPO4^2- is 0.02809 M.

But when the solution is made, these are the concentrations, and any further dissociation would be minimal because they form a buffer.

Wait, but the initial concentrations are based on the moles, so the concentrations are determined by the buffer. Therefore, the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028 M, which is not matching any of the options.

I'm confused. Perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- due to the dissociation of H2PO4^- in the solution, but I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- already in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the solution after mixing, and the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4, but the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 can react with water to form HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in that case, the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would change.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not a buffer. Let me think of it as a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, but not considering them as a buffer.

But that can't be right because they are in a buffer relationship.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the solution is not a buffer because the amounts are such that the pH is determined by another factor. But I don't see any other information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the total concentration of phosphate (sum of all species), but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Another thought: I'm mixing up the initial moles and concentrations. Wait, wait. When you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, you get H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. The total concentration of phosphate is the sum of all species (H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-), but the question is only about HPO4^2-.

But the initial concentrations are 0.03667 M H2PO4^- and 0.02809 M HPO4^2-.

But in the presence of these two, the solution is a buffer, and the pH is around 7.09. Under this pH, perhaps some of the HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

Wait, but the concentration would be very small. Let me calculate it.

At pH 7.09, the concentration of H+ is 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

The third dissociation of HPO4^2- is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/[H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M,

[H+] = 8.2e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809)/(8.2e-8) ≈ (5.056e-14)/(8.2e-8) ≈ 6.166e-7 M.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈6.166e-7 M.

But the question is asking for [HPO4^2-], which is 0.02809 M (not considering this dissociation, but it's negligible).

Wait, but the problem's options are in the order of 1e-7 M, so 6.166e-7 is option A: 6.24e-7. But wait, the calculation gives 6.17e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7. Close enough, considering rounding errors.

But wait, why is the problem asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions when the calculation for PO4^3- is around 6e-7 M? Because orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-. But the question says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the [HPO4^2-] when considering the buffer.

Wait, maybe the solution is not a buffer because the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is 1:1 or something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in pure solution without considering the buffer. But that doesn't make sense because the buffer will affect the concentration.

Wait, another approach: Since the solution is a buffer, the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the buffer equation.

We have pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But we don't know the pH; however, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and if we calculate the concentration based on that pH, considering the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-, then we can find [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but that seems circular. Let me try.

Let me denote:

Let [HPO4^2-] = x.

[H2PO4^-] = y.

We know that x = (some function) based on the buffer equation and the solution pH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, leading to a certain pH, and HPO4^2- then dissociates into PO4^3-.

But then, the concentration of HPO4^2- would be determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, let me think about this step-by-step.

1. Calculate the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

2. Use the buffer equation to find the pH.

3. Use this pH to find the dissociation of HPO4^2- into PO4^3-.

4. The [HPO4^2-] after dissociation is what we need.

But in this case, the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, which is much higher than the [PO4^3-] that comes from this dissociation. So the [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02809 M, but the problem's options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the solution as a buffer and then calculating the concentration of HPO4^2- as it is in the buffer, not considering any further dissociation.

Then, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, but again, the options are way off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of phosphate ions, considering all forms, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have me calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the buffer equation without considering the initial moles, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.00 g KH2PO4: 136.09 g/mol → moles = 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol.

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol → 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^-: 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2-: 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M.

So, the ratio is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.766) → 7.208 + (-0.114) = 7.094.

Now, using Ka3, let's compute the concentration of PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

[H+] is 1e-7.094 ≈ 8.2e-8.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2- ]) / [H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.2e-8)

≈ (5.056e-14) / (8.2e-8)

≈ 6.166e-7 M.

But again, the question is about [HPO4^2-], which is 0.02809 M, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the intended approach is different.

Alternative approach: Maybe the solution isn't a buffer and that the phosphate comes from the dissociation of the initial phosphate species.

Wait, but that can't be right because the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in a buffer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- instead, but the question says orthophosphate.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of the phosphate ions in the solution considering the hydrolysis of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it comes from both the Na2HPO4 and the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but that's not the case. The initial solution already has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the hydrolysis of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

So, let's model that.

The initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M.

But H2PO4^- can lose a proton to form HPO4^2-.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka for this is 6.2e-8.

So, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 - x.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 + x.

[H+] = x.

But wait, the solution is buffered, so the [H+] is determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, but perhaps I should set up the equation based on Ka2.

Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-] = 6.2e-8.

Let me rearrange this:

[H+] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/[HPO4^2-]

But from the buffer equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Which gives [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Wait, but I don't know pH yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of the concentrations.

Wait, but without knowing pH, I can't proceed this way.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently.

The solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

We have the concentrations as 0.03667 M H2PO4^- and 0.02809 M HPO4^2-.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log(0.02809 / 0.03667) → 7.208 + log(0.766) → 7.208 - 0.114 =7.094.

Now, knowing the pH, we can find [H+] = 1e-7.094 ≈8.2e-8.

Now, considering the third dissociation step:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

The equilibrium expression is Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

= (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.2e-8)

≈ (5.056e-14) / (8.2e-8) ≈6.166e-7 M.

But again, the question is about [HPO4^2-], which is 0.02809 M.

Wait, but all the options are around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the intended answer is the concentration of PO4^3-, which is around 6.17e-7 M, matching option A:6.24e-7.

But the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly, and it's actually asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it dissociates into PO4^3-, thus reducing the [HPO4^2-].

But earlier calculation shows that the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, and [PO4^3-] is 6.17e-7 M.

So the [HPO4^2-] is much higher than the options. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to find [PO4^3-], which is around 6e-7 M, matching option A.

But the question clearly says "orthophosphate ions", which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where only Na2HPO4 is dissolved. Let me check that.

If only Na2HPO4 is present, then the concentration would be moles / volume.

But the problem states both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are present.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the solution after all possible dissociations, and the [HPO4^2-] is determined by the buffer.

But again, I'm stuck because the buffer approach gives [HPO4^2-] as 0.028 M, which isn't matching the options.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the problem considers the phosphate ions as coming from the dissociation of the salts, but I'm considering the initial concentrations as the actual concentrations, whereas in reality, the solution has more complex equilibria.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentrations are the total concentrations of the species, considering all equilibria. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the given Ka values and the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the buffer.

But I don't see how that would change the [HPO4^2-], which is determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the buffer without considering the initial moles. No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the pH. Let me compute it more accurately.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02809 / 0.03667 = approx 0.766.

So log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.2076 -0.114 =7.0936.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0936) ≈ 8.17e-8.

Now, using this [H+], the [PO4^3-] is (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / (8.17e-8) = (5.056e-14)/(8.17e-8) ≈6.185e-7 M.

But again, the question is about [HPO4^2-], which is 0.02809 M, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the solution is a buffer and using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio, then using that ratio to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But without knowing the pH, I can't proceed that way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have me find the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the buffer, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the solution's pH is such that the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the pH and the buffer equation. But without knowing the pH, I can't find the concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have me find the concentration of HPO4^2- from the solution's pH, which is determined by the buffer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of phosphate ions in the solution considering all possible equilibria, but I'm not seeing how.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total phosphate concentration, which is the sum of all species, but the problem specifically asks for orthophosphate (HPO4^2-).

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is the same as the concentration from Na2HPO4, which is 0.02809 M. But that's not an option.

Wait, another angle: Perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution without considering the buffer. That is, considering only the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

So, the initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M.

The dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 =6.2e-8.

Assuming that x is the concentration of HPO4^2- formed, then:

Ka2 = x^2 / (0.03667 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.03667, since x is small compared to 0.03667.

So, x^2 ≈ 0.03667 *6.2e-8 → x^2 ≈ 2.266e-9 → x ≈ 4.76e-5 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] would be approximately 4.76e-5 M, which is 4.76e-5, but the options are 1e-7, so this isn't matching either.

Wait, but that's without considering the buffer effect. So this can't be the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2- and H+ and not considering the Na2HPO4's contribution. But that would be incorrect because the solution already contains HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.

I think I'm stuck. The initial approach gives [HPO4^2-] as 0.028 M, which is way higher than any option. The only way to get an answer matching the options is to consider the PO4^3- concentration, which is around 6e-7 M. So perhaps the intended answer is option A:6.24e-7 M.

But the problem says orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-. So I'm confused. Unless the problem has a typo, and it's actually asking for PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- after taking into account the dissociation of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that would require solving a system of equations.

Let me try.

Let me denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a.

Let [HPO4^2-] = b.

Let [PO4^3-] = c.

Initial concentrations:

a_initial = 0.03667 M.

b_initial = 0.02809 M.

c_initial = 0.

But due to dissociation, some H2PO4^- becomes HPO4^2- and H+:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+ → let x be the increase in [HPO4^2-] from H2PO4^- dissociation.

Similarly, HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+ → let y be the increase in [PO4^3-] from HPO4^2- dissociation.

So,

a = a_initial - x.

b = b_initial + x - y.

c = y.

But this is getting complicated. Also, the [H+] would be from both sources: x and y.

This is probably beyond the intended scope of the problem, but let me try.

The Ka2 = [HPO4^2-][H+]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] =1.8e-12.

We have three variables: x, y, [H+].

Additionally, from the buffer equation, the pH is determined by the ratio of b and a. But since this is a buffer, the pH is determined by the initial concentrations, so I'm back to the original problem.

Given the time I've spent and the options given, I think the intended answer is option A:6.24e-7 M, which matches the [PO4^3-] I calculated earlier. But the question is about orthophosphate, so this is conflicting.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, we analyze the given data and equilibria. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided:  
- \( K_a1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \)  
- \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \)  
- \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations
The total volume is 0.2 L, so:  
- \([H₂PO₄⁻] = \frac{0.007334}{0.2} \approx 0.03667 \, \text{M}\),  
- \([HPO₄²⁻] = \frac{0.005618}{0.2} \approx 0.02809 \, \text{M}\).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The relevant equilibrium is between \( \text{H₂PO₄⁻} \) and \( \text{HPO₄²⁻} \), with \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). The pKa is:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(K_a2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
\]
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄²⁻]}{[H₂PO₄⁻]}\right).
\]
Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log\left(\frac{0.02809}{0.03667}\right) \approx 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094.
\]

### Step 4: Account for dissociation of HPO₄²⁻
The third dissociation of \( \text{HPO₄²⁻} \) is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}, \quad K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]
At pH 7.094, \([H⁺] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[H⁺]} = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.02809)}{8.2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Address the question
The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (\(\text{HPO₄²⁻}\)). However, the calculated concentration of \(\text{HPO₄²⁻}\) from the buffer is approximately \(0.02809 \, \text{M}\), which is much larger than the options provided. The only value matching the options is the concentration of \(\text{PO₄³⁻}\), which is approximately \(6.17 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). This suggests the problem may have intended to ask for \(\text{PO₄³⁻}\) instead of \(\text{HPO₄²⁻}\).

### Final Answer:
Given the options and the calculations, the closest match is:  
**Answer: A**
