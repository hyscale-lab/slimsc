Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think it through. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are given in terms of power laws: 1 over plx to the first, second, third, or fourth power.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star with a parallax of, say, 1 parsec is closer than one with a parallax of 0.5 parsecs. Oh wait, no, wait—the parallax p is equal to 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as the distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly in what sense? I think it means that they're uniformly distributed in space, but that's a big assumption. Or maybe it's uniform in some other way. Wait, no—uniformly distributed in the sense that they are spread out uniformly in space, not clustered, but perhaps in all directions, but more importantly, how do their distances distribute?

Wait, the problem says the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to find how the number density (the number of stars in a given range of plx) depends on plx.

So, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax around plx, say from plx to plx + dplx,
