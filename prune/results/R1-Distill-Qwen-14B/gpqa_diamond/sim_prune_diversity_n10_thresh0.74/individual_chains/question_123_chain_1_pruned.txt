Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. So, we need to figure out the distance from the Galaxy's perspective. Let me recall some physics concepts. Oh right, this is probably about relative velocity and maybe time dilation due to special relativity since the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s. Let me check. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that. Oh, so it's a significant fraction but not extremely close to c. So, relativistic effects might be noticeable.

Hmm, but wait the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So, simplification.

So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the time experienced is 50 seconds. But the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. So, I think we need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.

Wait, no. Because the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is different from the Galaxy's frame due to time dilation. So, we'll probably need to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Let me think about the Lorentz transformations. The scenario involves two frames, S (Galaxy) and S' (ejecta), moving relative to each other at velocity v. But wait, in the problem, from S' (ejecta) frame, the Galaxy (S) is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the relative speed between the two frames is v = 60,000 km/s. So, the speed of
