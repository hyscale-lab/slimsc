Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm. So, the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities of objects and light, especially in different frames, we might have to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. But wait, is the glass's velocity v significant enough that we need to apply relativistic effects? Because usually, for velocities much smaller than the speed of light, we can ignore them, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem doesn't specify, but the options involve terms with v, so I guess I can't ignore it.

Let me think. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass. The index of refraction n tells us that the speed of light in the glass is v_glass = c/n. Wait, but wait, that's the speed in the glass when the glass is at rest relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving.
