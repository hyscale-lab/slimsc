Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus were given to mice orally. Then, they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. So, what process is happening here?

Wait, so what's happening when they tag the inner capsid proteins? Rotavirus is a virus that infects the gut, right? The inner capsid is the part that's probably involved in the immune response. When they're tagged with GFP, maybe the proteins are being used as antigens.

The mice received them via oral gavageâ€”so the stomach and intestines would process them. Stomach acid would break down some proteins, which explains why some fluorescence was destroyed. But some made it through and got to the Peyer patches. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're sites where antigens are sampled, especially for oral vaccines.

In the Peyer patches, the antigens would be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, maybe dendritic cells or M cells. Then, these antigens would activate B cells. The B cells would then proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells or memory cells.

Now, when they isolate the proliferating cells and sequence their variable heavy chain genes, high variability suggests that each cell has a slightly different sequence. How does that happen?

I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes. One is somatic hypermutation, which introduces mutations into the variable regions of the B cell receptors. This increases the diversity of the antibodies produced. So, if each B cell's variable region is a bit different, it's probably due to somatic hypermutation.

Other options: Complement activation is more about lysis of pathogens, not about gene variability. Class switching is about changing the antibody's isotype (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions. VDJ recombination happens during the initial formation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, which sets the initial diversity. But in this question, the process is happening after the B cells have already been activated, so it's probably not VDJ.

So, the process that leads to high variability in the variable regions after antigen exposure is somatic hypermutation. That must be option A.


The question involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches were identified, and the proliferating cell population was isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability, which suggests a process that increases diversity in the B cell receptor repertoire.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors after antigen exposure, increasing diversity. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system lysing pathogens and is unrelated to the observed variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process generates initial diversity in B cell receptors during their development in the bone marrow, but it occurs before antigen exposure and does not explain the observed variability in this context.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen exposure and during the immune response. This process is consistent with the observed results in the experiment.

Answer: A
