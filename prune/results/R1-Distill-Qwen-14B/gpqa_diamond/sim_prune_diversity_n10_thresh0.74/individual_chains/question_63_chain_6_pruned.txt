Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations, but wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, non-rigid rotor allows for some stretching of the bond, so it's a bit more complex.

The question is about when the molecule is in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Fundamental state probably means the lowest vibrational state, right? So like, the ground state of both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. So for the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (I guess J=0 or J=1? Oh wait, for diatomic molecules, the rotational state starts at J=0, but in some cases selection rules might apply).

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So that's the ground state, which is v=0 and J=0? Or maybe J=1? No, J can be 0,1,2,... So the fundamental state would be the lowest possible state, which is v=0 and J=0.

Now, the molecule absorbs a photon. The photon has energy E_photon = h*f, and momentum p_photon = E/c. But since photons are massless particles, their momentum is related to their energy by p = E/c. So if we can find the energy difference between the states, we can find the photon's momentum.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So after absorbing a photon, the molecule moves to the next lowest state. So what's the next state after the fundamental state?

In quantum mechanics, molecules can change their state either by changing vibrational or rotational quantum numbers. The selection rules for diatomic molecules are usually Δv = ±1 (for vibration) and ΔJ = ±1 (for rotation), but sometimes ΔJ can be ±2 or 0 depending on the transition. But wait, since the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0. To go to the next lowest energy state, it would probably have to change either v or J.

Wait, the next lowest energy could be either the next vibrational state (v=1)
