Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, given the information. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and periods. But the goal is to choose which one has a higher probability of transiting. 

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the star's orbit. Oh wait, actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's the area of the planet relative to the star. But wait, no, maybe that's the depth of the transit. The probability of a transit occurring is a different thing. Oh right, the probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, I think the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align with our line of sight. So the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Let me think. The formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_* / a)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, is it (R_* / (a))? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Wait, I think the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by some function, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a), but
