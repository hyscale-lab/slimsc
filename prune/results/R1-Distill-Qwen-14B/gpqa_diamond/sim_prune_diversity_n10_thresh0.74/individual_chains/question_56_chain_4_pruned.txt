Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. The question is about a specific decay from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability.

Let me think. The standard notation is |n, l, m>, right? So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which means it's an s orbital), m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the electron is dropping from n=3 to n=1 in two steps.

Wait, transitions in hydrogen happen due to the emission or absorption of photons. Dipole transitions are those allowed by the dipole selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1, right? So for each transition, the change in l must be ±1, and m can change by 0 or ±1.

Wait, but in this case, the electron is going from n=3, l=0 to n=1, l=0. So in two dipole transitions, each transition must follow the selection rules. So the first step is from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then from there to n=1, l=0.

So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1 because Δl can be +1. Because if it goes to l=1, then the next transition can have Δl = -1 to reach l=0. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So possible intermediate states would have n=2 or maybe n=2 again? Because the electron can't jump more than a certain amount in a single transition. Wait, but the question says it's a two-step decay, so the first step could be from n=3 to n=2, since that's a Δn of -1, which is allowed.

Wait, can Δn be any value? Or are there specific selection rules for n? I remember that for hydrogen, the selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but in practice, the allowed transitions are those where l changes by ±1. So the n can vary as needed as long as the l changes properly.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to something with l=1. So the possible states are n=2, l=1. Because m can change by 0, +1, or -1.

So the possible m values for the first transition would be m=0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>.

Then, from this intermediate state, the next transition must go to n=1, l=0. So the second transition must have Δl = -1 (since l goes from 1 to 0). So that's allowed.

Now, what about the m values? Let's see. The initial state has m=0. So the first transition can change m by ±1 or 0. Suppose
