Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is a way to determine the degree of unsaturation in a molecule. Each degree of unsaturation represents either a ring or a double bond or a triple bond. The formula to calculate it is Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. Oh, but in this case, the product might have some changes after reaction, so I need to figure out what the product looks like first.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene would be a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering is 3-en, so the double bond is between C3 and C4 (since cyclohexene is usually between C1 and C2, but in this case, it's different). Then, there's a formyl group (CHO) at position 2. Also, at position 5, there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). And a carboxylic acid group is at position, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, I think, because in the numbering, the carboxylic acid is usually given the lowest possible number. So cyclohexene with substituents at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid at position 1.

Wait, cyclohexene's double bond is at position 3. So the ring is 6-membered, with substituents at 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- so the substituent is a vinyl group, which is a CH₂=CH- group attached at position 5.

So the molecule has several double bonds. Let me count them. The cyclohexene has one double bond. Then, the vinyl group has another double bond (CH₂=CH-). And the formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl (double bond). So that's three double bonds in the starting material.

But wait, when reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? I think that's a reaction where the triple bonds or double bonds are being opened. Wait, wait, no. Red phosphorus with HI is typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Or wait, no. Another possibility: maybe it's a reaction where the carbonyl groups undergo some reaction.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's usually for ketones and aldehydes to eliminate the carbonyl group, replacing it with a methylene group. But wait, the Wolff-Kishner usually involves heating with a strong base and the phosphorus. Alternatively, another reaction: the reaction of alkenes with HI might involve addition, but with excess HI, maybe it's more of a hydration or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI could be involved in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but I'm not sure. Or another reaction: maybe the opening of epoxides, but that's usually with H2SO4 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with the formyl group.

Wait, another angle: the formyl group is a CHO group. Reacting this with HI in presence of red phosphorus. I think that maybe this is a reaction where the carbonyl group is being converted into a CH₂ group. Because I remember that when a carbonyl group (like aldehyde or ketone) reacts with HI in presence of a reducing agent, like red phosphorus, it can get reduced. For example, aldehydes can be reduced to alkanes.

Wait, but wait—what's the exact reaction? The reaction of aldehydes or ketones with HX (like HI) in the presence of a reducing agent. Oh, right, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. But maybe under different conditions, like with HI and red phosphorus, something else happens.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into CH₂I. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of HI, the aldehyde group
