Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So, the question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

Looking at the NMR data for the anhydride: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. The 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Wait, 165 is probably an carbonyl, maybe from the anhydride. The 137 could be a carbonyl adjacent carbon or maybe a double bond carbon.

So, the starting anhydride is probably a cyclic anhydride because it has a single peak in the 1H NMR. A cyclic anhydride would have symmetry, so all the protons might be equivalent. Maybe something like a five-membered ring, as those are more stable.

The reaction is between this anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. I think that's a diene. So, this looks like a Diels-Alder reaction. The anhydride is a dienophile, reacting with the diene.

Wait, but the major and minor products come from this reaction. Diels-Alder can form endo and exo products, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here. Or maybe there's some regiochemistry involved.

Wait, the tetramethyl cyclopentadiene has four methyl groups, which probably make it more substituted. So, when the Diels-Alder happens, the diene (the cyclopentadiene) would attack the dienophile (the anhydride). The reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents.

After the Diels-Alder, the products would have two substituents from the dienophile and the four methyl groups from the diene. But wait, the molecular formula is C13H16O3. Let me check the starting materials.

The anhydride comes from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, the acid has a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, the dicarboxylic acid has a cis double bond. So perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So the structure of the anhydride would be cyclic, probably a five-membered ring with the two carbonyl groups connected by the former double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is a bicyclic anhydride? Or maybe a maleic anhydride analog. Wait, maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride with an oxygen bridge. But in this case, the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid, so the anhydride would have the structure where the two CO groups are connected via a four-membered ring? Or maybe a five-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a maleic-type structure. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2CH2)-C=O, but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: maleic anhydride is cyclic with two double bonds, but perhaps in this case, the anhydride is formed by the dehydration of cis-dicarboxylic acid, so it would have a structure like
