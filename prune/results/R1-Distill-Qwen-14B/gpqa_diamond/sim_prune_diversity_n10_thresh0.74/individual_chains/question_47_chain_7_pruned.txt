Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. The molecular weight would be 9*12 + 11*1 +14 +16*2 = 108 +11 +14 +32 = 165 g/mol. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let me think about the functional groups and structure.

The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching, maybe from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, or amide. Since it's a strong band, likely an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group, so an ethyl group.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe an NH2 group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Hmm. Could it be an NH adjacent to something else? Or perhaps an OCH2 group? Not sure yet.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. The quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Since the ethyl is at 1.20 (t), maybe this is the OCH2 part. Like in an ester group, where the ethyl is OCH2CH3. The quartet at 4.5 could be the OCH2 protons next to the carbonyl.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like para-substituted benzene. For example, two substituents in the para positions, each causing the aromatic protons to split into doublets.

Putting this together, the molecule likely has a benzene ring with substituents that cause the aromatic protons to be at around 7 and 8 ppm. The substituents could be electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro or carbonyl, or electron-donating groups like methoxy or amino.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But wait, benzamide has the amide group adjacent to the benzene. The substituents would be ethoxy and amide. The IR shows amide N-H stretches, which would be around 3400-3500, which fits. The carbonyl would be around 1650 cm-1 for amide, but the IR given is 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or ketone. So maybe this is less likely.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide has a structure R-NH-C=O. The substituents are 4-ethoxy (so ethoxy at para position), and the formamide would have the NH adjacent to the carbonyl. The IR would show N-H (amide) stretches around 3420, 3325, which fits. The carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches the IR. So the formamide's carbonyl would be around 1700-1750. The NMR: The ethoxy would be at 1.20 (t,3H), the OCH2 would be around 4.5 (maybe the quartet for the OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl). Wait, but the OCH2 in ethoxy would be a triplet or a quartet? No, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3. In the NMR, the OCH2 would be as a quartet if adjacent to the CH3. But in the options, the quartet is at 4.5, which is higher than usual for OCH2 in ethoxy. Wait, ethoxy groups typically have OCH2CH3 as a quartet around 4.1 ppm for the OCH2 and triplet at 1.2 for CH3. But in this case, the OCH2 is at 4.5, which is higher, maybe because it's next to an electronegative group like a carbonyl.

The aromatic protons in para-substituted benzene would be two doublets, which matches the NMR. So this could be a possibility. The amide NH would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Wait, that's 2H. If this is an amide, the NH would be a singlet as NH in amide is usually a broad peak, but the integration is 2H. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 in some other structure.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3 groups. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is 3 carbons. So the substituents would be NH2 at para and propiono at another position.

IR: The NH2 would have strong N-H stretches, which matches. The carbonyl (ester) would be around 1720, which matches. NMR: The ethyl (CH2CH3) group would be at 1.20 (t,3H). The propionate would have an OCH2CH2CH3 group. The OCH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split into a quartet. Wait, in propionate, the structure is CH2CH2COO-. So the OCH2 would be adjacent to the COO- group. So the OCH2 would be at around 3.6-4.0 as a quartet. But in the NMR, the 4.5 is a quartet for 2H. Hmm, maybe not. Also, the amine would be a broad peak. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would have an NH2 group. The NMR would have a peak for the NH2, but in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a 2H broad singlet. That doesn't quite fit because NH2 would be a triplet of peaks (two protons), but perhaps this is a different scenario.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is benzoate ester with ethyl group and an amino group at the para position. So the substituents on benzene are -NH2 and -COOEt. IR: The amide (or amine) N-H would show strong peaks at 3420 and 3325. The carbonyl (ester) would be around 1720, which matches. NMR: The ethyl group would be at 1.20 (t,3H). The OCH2 from the ester would be around 4.5 ppm as a quartet (since it's next to the CH3). So the quartet at 4.5 (2H) matches. The aromatic protons: if the substituents are at para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. So in the NMR, 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a para substitution. But wait, if there's an amino group and a carbonyl group (like benzoate), the amino group is a strong activating group, so the ring would be activated, and the meta positions would have higher electron density. Hmm, but the NMR shows two doublets, which would suggest two sets of equivalent protons, so a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but that would make them not para). Wait, no, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, that's para. So the substituents are at para positions, making the aromatic protons as two doublets. So the aromatic region fits.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) in the NMR. What could that be? In ethyl benzoate, the OCH2 is at 4.5. But the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe that's the NH2 group? Wait, an NH2 group would show up as a broad signal. But in the case of an amine, the protons would split into a broad peak. But the integration is 2H, which makes sense for an NH2. However, amines can exchange protons and sometimes don't show up clearly, but in this case, it's at 4.0 ppm, which is a bit high for an NH2. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not deprotonated but is in a different environment. Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH group in an amide, but in option D, it's 4-aminobenzoate, so it's an amine, not an amide.

Wait, but in option D, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the benzoate ester (COOEt) and an amino group (NH2) in the para position. The amino group is -NH2. In the NMR, the NH2 would typically appear as a broad peak, but in this data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. So that fits. So the 4.0
