Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. Calculate the net potential energy of this system. Then there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, right. Grounded conducting sphere. So I remember that when a conductor is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential. Also, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. So, when you have a charge placed near such a sphere, I think the sphere will induce some charges.

Wait, but the charge q is outside the sphere, right? Because d is the distance from the center, and the sphere's radius is R. So if d is larger than R, then q is outside. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether d is greater than R or not. Hmm, but if it's a conducting sphere, probably d is greater. Because if q were inside, the sphere's behavior might be different.

So, the setup is: a point charge q is at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere with radius R, and the sphere is grounded. I need to find the potential energy of the system.

Potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges from infinity to their positions. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges might complicate things.

Let me think. When a charge is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will develop an induced charge. The induced charge will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same everywhere, right? Because in electrostatics, the potential on the surface of a conductor is uniform.

But wait, the sphere is grounded. That means it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential. So any induced charges on the sphere will adjust until the potential of the sphere is zero.

So, the presence of the charge q will induce a charge on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere must be zero. So the induced charges will adjust to make that happen.

Let me think about the method to calculate this. I remember that when a charge is placed near a grounded conductor, the potential energy can be found by considering the work done to bring the charge q to its position and the work done in inducing charges on the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere. So the induced charge
