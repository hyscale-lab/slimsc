Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a particular spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's written as a column vector, right? So the state vector is |ψ> = [3i; 4], or in components, ψ₁ = 3i and ψ₂ =4. Oh wait, electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so their states are two-dimensional. Got it.

The question is about the expectation value of S_y. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is the operator in question. So I'll need to apply this to S_y.

Wait, but what's S_y in terms of the Pauli matrices? Oh right, the spin operators are given by S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, and S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix, which is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So first, I need to write down the operator S_y. That would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. Let me write that out:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = [[0, -iħ/2], [iħ/2, 0]]

But wait, actually, to compute the expectation value, I don't need to expand S_y yet. Maybe it's better to compute <S_y> = <ψ| (ħ/2 σ_y) |ψ> .

Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value as (ħ/2) times <σ_y>, because σ_y is the Pauli matrix and the expectation value is just proportional to that.

So breaking it down, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * [ψ† σ_y ψ], where ψ is the state vector.

Wait, ψ is the column vector [3i, 4], right? So ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ], because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait no, wait. Wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. Its complex conjugate is -3i. Wait, no: 3i is 3 multiplied by i, so the complex conjugate is 3*(-i) = -3i. But wait, no, wait: if ψ is [3i,4], then ψ† is [3i*, 4*]. So 3i's conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now I need to compute ψ† σ_y ψ. So let's compute that.

First, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's compute σ_y multiplied by ψ.

Wait, no: the order is (ψ†) multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ. So let me write this out step by step.

So ψ is a column vector [3i; 4], and ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me do the matrix multiplication.

First row of ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] and we multiply by the columns of σ_y.

Wait, no: ψ† is a 1x2 matrix, and σ_y is 2x2. So their product is a 1x2 matrix.

Let me compute each element:

First element: (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) ) = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) ) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(−1) )= -3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me do this again.

Wait, matrix multiplication: [a b] * [[c d], [e f]] = [ac + be, ad + bf].

So ψ† σ_y = [ (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) , (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) ]

So:

First element: 0 + 4i → 4i.

Second element: (-3i)(-i) +0 → 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Then, multiply this by ψ, which is [3i;4]. Because [4i, -3] is a row vector, and ψ is a column vector. So the product is a scalar.

So:

(4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = ?

Compute each term:

4i *3i = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

-3 *4 = -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. The product is [4i, -3] multiplied by [3i; 4].

So matrix multiplication is [4i * 3i + (-3)*4].

Wait, 4i *3i is 12 i² = -12.

(-3) *4 is -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) )= -24.

So the expectation value <σ_y> is -24.

So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24) )= -12 ħ.

Wait, but the options are fractions. Hmm, I must have gone wrong somewhere because the options don't include -12 ħ. Let me recheck.

Wait, am I missing a factor? Let me think again.

Wait, the state vector: is it normalized? Because the expectation value calculation assumes that the state is normalized. So I should check whether the state is normalized.

The state is [3i,4]. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, that's a problem.

So the expectation value I calculated was assuming the state is normalized. If it's not, then I need to normalize it.

So the correct expectation value would be [ψ† S_y ψ] divided by [ψ† ψ].

Wait, yes. Because the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the state vector is |ψ>, and the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by <ψ|ψ> if it's not normalized. Or wait, no, because normalization is part of the state vector.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized, meaning <ψ|ψ> =1. If the state is given as [3i;4], then it's not normalized. So I should normalize it before proceeding.

So first, compute the norm squared: |3i|² + |4|² = (3)^2 +4^2 =9+16=25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is (1/5) [3i,4].

So the correct approach is to first normalize the state. Then compute the expectation value.

So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/5)(3i, 4)^T.

So ψ = [3i;4]/5.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I computed <σ_y> as -24, which was for the unnormalized state. So to get the expectation value correctly, I should compute (ψ† σ_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

Wait, ψ† σ_y ψ is -24, and ψ† ψ is 25, because |3i|^2 + |4|^2 is 25.

So <σ_y> = (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )= (-24)/25.

But wait, no: because the state is [3i;4], and ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

So ψ† ψ is [ -3i,4 ] * [3i;4 ] = (-3i)(3i) + 4*4.

That's (-9i²) +16 → (-9*(-1)) +16 →9+16=25.

So yes, the denominator is 25.

So <σ_y> = (-24)/25.

Then, S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-24 ħ)/(50) → simplifies to (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, that's option A. The options are:

A) -12 ħ/25

B) 12 ħ/25

C)25 ħ/2

D) -25 ħ/2.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait: wait another thing. Did I compute σ_y correctly?

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the standard formula.

The expectation value of S_y is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by (ψ† σ_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ).

Wait, but let me think again. The expectation value is <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, in this case, we have:

ψ† σ_y ψ = [ -3i,4 ] * σ_y * [3i;4 ].

Wait, let me compute this again.

Compute σ_y * ψ first. So σ_y is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Multiplying by ψ = [3i;4], so:

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, ψ† (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So: (-3i)(-4i) +4*(-3) = (12 i²) + (-12) → 12*(-1) = -12, plus -12 → total -24.

So yes, that's the same as before. So (ψ† σ_y ψ) is -24, and ψ† ψ is 25. So <σ_y> is -24/25.

Thus, <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12 ħ /25. Which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the State**:  
   The norm squared of the state is:  
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]  
   Since the norm is 5, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Matrix for \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:  
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
   \]  
   where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

3. **Expectation Value Formula**:  
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]  
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), which is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

4. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**:  
   First, compute \( \sigma_y \psi \):  
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Then, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

5. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \)**:  
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

6. **Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**:  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
