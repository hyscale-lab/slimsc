Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin 1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there's a spin 1/2 particle whose magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The initial state is probably an eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian, and when the field changes, the system is no longer in an eigenstate, leading to time evolution and oscillations.

Let me outline the steps. Initially, the system is in a magnetic field B along Z. The Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu·B. Since mu = gamma * S_z, this becomes H_initial = -gamma * B * S_z.

Because the particle is spin 1/2, the eigenvalues of S_z are ħ/2 and -ħ/2 (but wait, actually in units where ħ=1, S_z can be ±1/2). So the energy levels are E_+ = -gamma * B * (1/2) and E_- = gamma * B * (1/2). Wait, no, because mu is proportional to S_z, and H = -mu · B, so H_initial = -gamma B S_z. So when S_z is +1/2, H is -gamma B (1/2), and when S_z is -1/2, H is gamma B (1/2).

So the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial. But then the field is turned off and a new field B along Y is turned on. The new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B_new. B_new is along Y, so H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so I think the Hamiltonian should be H = -mu · B. Since B is along Y, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, S_y has different eigenvalues compared to S_z. The eigenstates of S_y are different, so after the field change, the system is in a state that's no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the
