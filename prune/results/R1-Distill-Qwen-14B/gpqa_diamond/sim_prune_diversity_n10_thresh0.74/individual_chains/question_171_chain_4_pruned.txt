Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile—like Br2—to either the ortho, meta, or para positions. The substituents also affect the reactivity of the ring, but the question here is about the para-isomer's weight fraction yield. Oh wait, the question is about the order of increasing para-isomer yield. So I need to figure out each substituent's directing effect and activation or deactivation.

The substances are 1 to 6:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methylbenzene, toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (benzoyloxy ethylbenzene? Wait, no, wait. Structure is benzene with a COOEt group. So that's an ester group attached to the benzene ring. So the group is O-CO-OEt? Or wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, no, wait. The formula is written as C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, wait, that's benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or perhaps it's the benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group connected to an ethyl ester. So it's a group like O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the substituent is O-CO-OEt? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. Structure-wise, it's benzene ring connected to a carbonyl (CO) group, which is connected to an ethoxy (OEt) group. So the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the actual structure is a benzene ring with a COOEt group. So the substituent is a carbonyloxyethyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So that's a meta director.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
Wait, Cl is attached directly to the benzene. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group due to its electronegativity. But wait, Cl is an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. Because despite being electron-withdrawing by induction, the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance, which directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. So Cl is a meta director? No, no, wait. Wait, for halogens, they're ortho/para directors but deactivating. So Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So in electrophilic substitution, the incoming electrophile will go to ortho and para positions more than meta. So for substitution, the major product would be ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So in substitution reactions, the incoming group would go to the meta position. So in this case, the para isomer would be less, because the substituent directs meta. So the para-isomer's yield would be lower.

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
This is a benzene ring with an ethyl group attached. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the incoming electrophile will go to ortho and para positions. The para isomer is one of the major products along with the ortho. So in this case, the para yield would be higher than groups that are meta directors but lower than groups that are strongly activating.

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)
The substituent is a carboxylic acid group. The COOH group is a strong deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carboxyl group) and is meta-directing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the COOH group is a meta director. Because it's a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions. So the para-isomer would be less in this case.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the substituents can affect the position of substitution. So for each substituent, the para isomer's yield depends on whether they are ortho/para or meta directors.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer will form. For meta directors, the para isomer would not form as much.

Wait, no, actually, it's more about the relative amounts. For example, in nitro groups (meta), the para isomer would be minor, maybe not formed at all? Or is it that the substituent directs the incoming group to the meta positions, so the incoming group is more likely to add meta to the substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In electrophilic substitution, substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming group to specific positions.

Groups that are activating (like -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3) are ortho/para directors. So the incoming group can go to ortho, para, and sometimes meta, but more ortho and para.

Groups that are deactivating can be either meta or ortho/para directors. For example, nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. Halogens are deactivating but ortho/para directors because of their resonance effects.

So for each substituent, their directing
