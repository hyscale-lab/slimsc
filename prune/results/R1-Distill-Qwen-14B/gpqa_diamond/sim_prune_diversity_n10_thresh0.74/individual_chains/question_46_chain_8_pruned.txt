Okay, so I need to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, and I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in alkene metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually for olefin metathesis. So in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, wait. Let me draw the structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. 1-ene is between C1 and C2. So 3-methyl would be on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me count again.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, that can't be. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons, double bond at position 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-
