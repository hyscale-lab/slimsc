Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, right, reactions with ketones and nitriles, I think.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when that reacts with NaCN, what happens? Oh, I remember that in the presence of a strong acid, a ketone can undergo a nucleophilic addition. NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's an acid-catalyzed addition.

In the first step, the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with H+ from the acid (since A is probably an acid). The H+ would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. Then the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an addition product where the oxygen becomes an alcohol and the carbon gets the CN group. So that would explain why the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile because the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol adjacent to the nitrile.

So for the first reaction, A should be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and HSO3^- ions. It's a weaker acid than H3O+ maybe? Or perhaps in this context, the first reaction requires H3O+ as the acid because NaHSO3 might not be strong enough or might not act the same way.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. There are two main ways: under acidic conditions or basic conditions.
