Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let me read the problem again carefully.

So, the reaction scheme is as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided. 

The first hint is about compound A reacting with a phosphorous ylide. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction, right? So this reaction is a Wittig reaction, where the ylide adds to a carbonyl group to form an alkene. 

So, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me try to visualize that structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached.

Wait, a propan-2-ylidene group would be like CH2-C(CH3)=. So the structure would be cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 that's a propenyl group attached via the central carbon (so the double bond is between C2 and C3 of that substituent).

Since the Wittig reaction forms alkenes, compound A must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) that reacts with the ylide. So, when the ylide attacks the carbonyl, the oxygen leaves as phosphate, and the double bond forms.

Let me think about the structure of compound A. If the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that means the starting carbonyl must have been cyclopentanone or something similar, but where the carbonyl is replaced by the double bond.

Wait, wait. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl O with a CH2 group. So, if the product has a substituent like CH2-C(CH3)=, that suggests the carbonyl in compound A was adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound A is cyclopentanone with some substituents. Let me try to draw this.

Suppose compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Let's imagine that the carbonyl is at position 1. Then, the Wittig reaction would add a group to the adjacent position. Wait, but in the product, we have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to consider the structure of the Wittig product. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-
