Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N, where N is the normalization constant. Phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The non-Gaussianity (nG) is to be calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the state in question.

Wait, so the relative entropy measure here is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state and that of the reference Gaussian state. But wait, no, more precisely, it's the relative entropy which is the difference of the two entropies, but I think in this context, it's being used to measure how non-Gaussian a state is by comparing it to a Gaussian state.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I need to compute this nG for these values.

But wait, how to approach this? Let's think about each part.

First, let's write down the state more clearly. The state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, normalized by N. N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

Given phi is -pi/4, let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi would be -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha^2) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Therefore, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Wait, but wait, the normalization has to be correct. Because the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. So I need to make sure the state is normalized, i.e., <psi|psi>=1.

But perhaps it's given that N is correct, so I can proceed.

Next, I need to find the density matrix rho for |psi>. That would be |psi><psi|. But the problem is that the state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, so the state |psi> is a superposition of two Gaussians. When you have a superposition of coherent states, the resulting state is non-Gaussian because it's a cat state.

But to compute the relative entropy, I need to compare rho (the state's density matrix) to a reference Gaussian state tau. The relative entropy del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. Wait, no, the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Or is it the other way? Wait, wait, the formula given here is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit unusual because usually relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, the formula seems to be S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But wait, that doesn't quite make sense because the relative entropy is typically asymmetric. Oh, wait, the given formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) − trace(tau ln tau)]. So that would be S(rho) − S(tau). So it's the difference in the von Neumann entropies of the state and the reference Gaussian.
