Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm kind of new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So I think the first thing I need to figure out is what the possible complexes are and which one is the blue dithiocyanato. I remember that in coordination chemistry, different ligands and their numbers can change the color of the complex. Dithiocyanato probably means it's a complex with two SCN- ions attached.

Wait, the stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. I think stability constants (β) represent the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+? Because β1=9. Then β2=40 would be [Co(SCN)2], but wait, what about the charges? Let me think.

Actually, the general formula for the stability constant is β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^(charge)] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). So for each n, it's the formation of the complex with n SCN ligands.

So the possible complexes are:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^(2+ -1?) Wait, Co^2+ with one SCN^- would be [Co(SCN)]^+. Because 2+ + (-1) = +1. So the charge would be +1, and β1=9.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So neutral complex. β2=40.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^2-? Because 2+ + 3*(-1) = -1? Wait, 2+ plus 3*(-1) is -1, but the β3 is 63. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for n=1: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1). n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (charge 0). n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^–1. But that would be a negative charge. Wait, but β3 is 63, which is higher than β2, so that complex is more stable.

Wait, but wait, maybe the highest β is for the most stable complex, which is n=3.
