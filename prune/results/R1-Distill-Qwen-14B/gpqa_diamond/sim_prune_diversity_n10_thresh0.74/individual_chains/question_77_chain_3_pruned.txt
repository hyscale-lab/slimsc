Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two different rearrangements. The first one is a reaction starting with ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it undergoes treatment with BuLi followed by H+. Then the product A is formed. The second part involves a complex molecule being heated, leading to product B. We have to choose the correct major products from the options given.

First, I'll tackle the first part of the reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with an OCH2 group attached. The O is connected to a CH2, which in turn is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Breaking down the substituent: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. That's a four-carbon chain. The double bond is between C2 and C3 (but-2-en), and there's a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is actually CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, wait, but the numbering. For but-2-en-1-yl, the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but since it's but-2-en-1-yl,
