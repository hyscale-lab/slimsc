Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and ending up with product 4. I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4.

Let me start by breaking down the reaction steps.

The first compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta... is a norbornene structure. So it's a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So that's a bulky substituent attached to the bridge.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me visualize that. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, and at positions 5 and 6, there are dibromomethyl groups. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group attached, I think.

Sodium iodide (NaI) is a good nucleophile, especially in the context of elimination or substitution reactions. Also, when you have dibromides, sometimes it's about displacement reactions. Oh, wait, but the reaction is at elevated temperature. So maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two CH2Br2 groups. So each of those is a good leaving group. When treated with NaI, perhaps an SN2 reaction occurs. But SN2 on a cyclohexane ring? Hmm, but I think more likely, this is a coupling reaction. Oh, maybe it's a ring-opening of the norbornene structure.

Wait, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) is a strained molecule. When you have a diene, like the norbornene, and you have a dienophile, they can undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But here, the other compound is 5,6
