Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it slow.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, it's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have carbonyl (C=O) which usually absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a clue that the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's see what each signal corresponds to. 

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in different positions which affect the number of distinct aromatic protons. If the substituents are para, there would be two sets of aromatic protons—maybe two doublets each, but in this case, two signals. Maybe it's a meta substitution? Wait, no, di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. Let me think. For para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent H environments, giving two sets. For example, if substituents are both in para positions, the ring H would split into two sets: perhaps two doublets. So in the NMR, two signals for aromatic H.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH-. So, maybe there's a substituent with a vinyl group attached. The doublet might be from a CH₂ group next to a double bond, and the quartet perhaps from a group adjacent to that. Or maybe a substituent like an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, vinyl-H would be the protons on a double bond.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene could be ester groups. Since the IR shows an ester, maybe one of the substituents is an ester group. But wait, the substituents are two, so perhaps one is an ester and the other is something else, maybe a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. No, wait, the molecular formula options have O2. So the ester group is OCO, so each ester would contribute two oxygens. But wait, the formula is C?H?O2, so maybe the substituents are an ester and another group with oxygen, but maybe not. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the NMR also shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two methyl groups in the molecule. And no –CH2 groups. So where would these methyls be?

Let me consider possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Maybe one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other substituent could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent like a vinyl ester.

Wait, the NMR indicates vinyl-H, so there's probably a vinyl group attached. Maybe the substituents are ester groups attached through a vinyl chain. Like, perhaps one substituent is an
