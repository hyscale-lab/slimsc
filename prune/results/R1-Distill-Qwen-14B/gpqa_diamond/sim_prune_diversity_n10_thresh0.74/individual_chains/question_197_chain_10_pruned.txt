Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500, which is a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, the other significant IR peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. But wait, the 1610 cm-1 is around where aromatic C=C stretches appear, and the 1450 might be C-O stretching or another aromatic mode. Hmm.

Then, the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm, a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Or maybe a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they're deshielded and might be a sharp peak, not broad. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually broad because they exchange with water. So the 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid -OH proton. Or maybe an aldehyde?

Then, there's a peak at 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d) with 2H. Another at 7.2 ppm, also a doublet with 2H. Those are typical for an aromatic ring with substituents causing splitting. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm might indicate a para-substituted benzene. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are usually split into two doublets. So that's possibly a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm, a multiplet for 1H. That seems like a CH group adjacent to something.
