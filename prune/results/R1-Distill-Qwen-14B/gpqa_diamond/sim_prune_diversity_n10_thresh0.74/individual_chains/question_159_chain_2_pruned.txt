Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think this has to do with redshift. Right, because quasars are very distant objects, their light gets redshifted.

Wait, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth in a universe defined by the Lambda-CDM model. The parameters given are Hubble constant of 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density (Omega_m) is 0.3, dark energy (Omega_lambda) is 0.7, and it's flat. So the universe is flat, meaning Omega_total is 1 (since 0.3 + 0.7 = 1, yeah).

The options are A to D, all around 6-9 Gpc. I'm trying to remember how comoving distance relates to redshift. Oh right, the comoving distance is a way to measure distance in an expanding universe. It's calculated using the integral of 1/(H(z)) dz, where H(z) is the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift.

But wait, I don't have the redshift here. The question gives a peak wavelength of 790 nm. I think that's the observed wavelength. So the emitted wavelength must be shorter because of redshift. Let's think about how to get the redshift from that.

The peak is at 790 nm. If it's in the optical or near-infrared, maybe the emitted wavelength is in the optical. Let me think: the Balmer series in hydrogen has lines in the optical. Or maybe it's the Lyman-alpha line? Wait, Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm, so when redshifted to 790, that's a z of (790 / 121) -1. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 790 divided by 121 is about 6.528. So z would be 5.528. But wait, if the emitted wavelength is in the near-infrared or optical, perhaps it's more like the H-alpha line, which is around 656 nm. Then observed at 790, so z = (790/656) -1 ≈ 1.2. Hmm, but the problem says that the flux drops significantly below 790 nm. So maybe the peak is in the near-infrared, but the rest frame is optical. So the emission line is in the optical, but observed in the infrared because of redshift.

Wait, another approach: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared. So if this is a broad emission line, like Lyman-alpha, but observed in IR, that would suggest high redshift. Alternatively, if the peak is in the rest-frame optical, but observed in IR, then lower redshift.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the peak. If the peak is in the near-infrared (NIR) as observed, but in the rest frame of the quasar it's in the optical (maybe H-alpha at 656 nm). So then, the observed wavelength is longer because of redshift. So the redshift z would be (observed - emitted)/emitted. Let's compute that.

So if emitted is 656 nm (H-alpha), observed is 790. So z = (790 -656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z is about 0.2. Wait, but the flux drops at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, which would be bluer. So if the peak is at 790, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths, that implies that the blue side is less flux, which could be due to the fact that the spectrum is being observed in a particular band. Or maybe it's because the light is redshifted and we're seeing the rest-frame optical moving into the observed infrared. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if the peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that, maybe that's the Lyman limit. Wait, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm. But if the quasar's light is redshifted so that the Lyman limit is observed at 790 nm, that would mean a redshift of z = 790 / 91 ≈ 8.68. That's a very high redshift. But is that possible? I mean, quasars at z ~8 are observed, but that's rare.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman-alpha emission line. Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. So if it's observed at 790, z is (790/121) -1
