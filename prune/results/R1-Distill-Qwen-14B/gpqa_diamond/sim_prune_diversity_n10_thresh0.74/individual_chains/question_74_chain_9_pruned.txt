Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after some time has already passed without it decaying.

So, the setup is that we have an atom, and we know that the probability it decays within 100 minutes is 32%. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it's decayed. That leaves a 68% chance it hasn't decayed yet. But wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So we're being asked about the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, next 150 after the 50? Or total 200 minutes? Oh, no, the way it's phrased, 50 minutes have passed, and we're looking from now for 150 minutes. So total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but no, the decay in question is about the next 150 minutes, which would take the total time to 200. But wait, maybe I should model this as an exponential decay process.

Wait, radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that the atom has not decayed by time t is given by e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but the question says that within 100 minutes, the probability is 32% (0.32). So we can use that to find λ.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Solving for λ.

So e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately... ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Let's see: 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857. So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me get the exact value. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is:

Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but I know that ln(2) is about 0.693, so maybe ln(0.68) is around -0.385.

So λ is approximately 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless.
