Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups typically have carbonyl (C=O) absorption around 1700 cm^-1. So that's a big clue—there's an ester functional group in the molecule.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me break them down. Two signals for aromatic protons. Hmm, so on the aromatic ring, the substituents are causing the H's to split into two different environments. Since it's di-substituted, maybe the positions are para, meta, or ortho. Wait, for an aromatic ring, di-substituted usually has certain symmetry. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, but wait, the question says two signals—so maybe each substituent is causing the ring to have two different sets of aromatic Hs. Or perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two distinct sets of Hs, like in a meta substitution or maybe one substituent is large, creating two different environments.

Then, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond, like in an alkene or maybe an aromatic substituent. Wait, the ester group has an oxygen, so maybe the substituents on the benzene are an ester and another group.

Wait, the two vinyl-H signals. Let's think: vinyl groups are CH2=CH– or similar. But in the NMR, they're split into two. So perhaps there's a substituent with a vinyl group, maybe a CH2-CH2-O structure? Or maybe it's part of an ester. Wait, esters usually have R-O-CO-O-R structures or something else. No, wait, an ester is RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups.

Wait, if one substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, maybe the other substituent is something else. Let me think: the aromatic ring has two substituents, one being an ester group. What else? Maybe a methyl group, another substituent, like a CH2CH2 group? Or another ester group? No, because it's di-substituted.

Wait, the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. A vinyl group usually has two protons, but if they're in different environments, maybe they split into different signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent with more than one vinyl group, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the two vinyl-H signals could be from a group like CH2=CH– attached to something. But why two different signals? Maybe the substituent has a structure where the vinyl protons are adjacent to different groups, causing different splitting.

Also, in the NMR, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two different methyl groups. No –CH2 signals, which suggests that there are no methylene (CH2) groups in the molecule. So the structure must consist only of CH3, CH, and aromatic C.

Wait, putting this together. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group – maybe something like OCOOR. The other substituent could be something else. Let's think about the substituents.

Ester group: RCOOR'. So for example, if the substituent is an ethyl ester, like OCOOCH2CH3, but that would have a CH2CH3 group, which has -CH2- and -CH3. But wait, the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 signals, only –CH3. So maybe the ester is a methyl ester, OCOOCH3. That would contribute a –CH3 group, which is one of the two –CH3 signals in the NMR.

What's the other substituent?
