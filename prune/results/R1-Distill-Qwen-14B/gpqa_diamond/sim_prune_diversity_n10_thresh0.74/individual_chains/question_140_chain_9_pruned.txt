Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I'll try to identify what X, Y, W, G, and B could be.

Starting with the reaction between X and Y. The fact that X incorporates a heavier isotope suggests that X might be a compound where one of its elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass. But wait, maybe X is an element, not a compound? Like, perhaps a diatomic element that's used as a reagent. Oh, wait, the substance X and its analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents are things like NaOH, HCl, perhaps? Wait, no, HCl is a liquid, but maybe X is something else.

Wait, the reaction releases gas W whose molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So, let's think about what gases have molecules where protons equal neutrons. Let's think about possible gases:

- H2: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So, for H2, each molecule has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But that's not equal. So each H has 1p and 0n; so per molecule, 2p and 0n. So not same. So H2 is unlikely.

Wait, wait, perhaps gas W is CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 protons in total (C:6, O:8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22). Number of neutrons in CO2 would vary based on isotopes, but the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So protons are 22, so neutrons must also be 22. But in reality, each O is 16O (8 protons, 8 neutrons), C is 12C (6 p,6 n). So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2=22. Oh wait, that's exactly it! So W is CO2.

Wait, but wait, in CO2, each O is 16O and C is 12C. So each CO2 molecule has 6+16*2 = 22 protons. The number of neutrons would be 6 (from C) + 8*2 (from O) = 22. So yes, same number of neutrons and protons. So W is CO2.

But wait, wait, the reaction is X reacting with Y to produce CO2. So, what's Y? Y is liquid. So, liquid Y could be water? Or maybe something else. Let me think about reactions that produce CO2. For example, carbonate reacting with acid? Or maybe something like a metal carbonate reacting with an acid.

Wait, but what's the precipitate G? When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So perhaps it's a double displacement reaction. For example, if Y is an acid (but it's a liquid), then X might be a carbonate reacting with a strong acid to produce CO2, water, and a precipitate. Or perhaps X is a metal sulfide reacting with an acid.

Wait, but if W is CO2, then perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. So the reaction would be X (carbonate) + acid Y â†’ CO2 + water + precipitate. But then, carbonate reacting with acid would produce CO2 and H2O, but if there's a precipitate, maybe it's a salt? Or perhaps Y is something
