Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, two reactions are performed, and then the products are combined and analyzed via HPLC. I need to figure out how many peaks they'll see in both types of chromatograms.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones. So the starting material is a ketone. Structure-wise, hexan-3-one means a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3. The 5-methoxy substituent is a methoxy group on carbon 5.

So, the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it properly. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO-(CH2)3. So positions 1 to 6: carbons 1, 2, 3 (C=O), 4,5,6. 5-methoxy means on carbon 5, a methoxy group. So, structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count. Hexane is six carbons. The ketone is on carbon 3, so numbering from left to right: 1,2,3 (CO), 4,5,6. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2
