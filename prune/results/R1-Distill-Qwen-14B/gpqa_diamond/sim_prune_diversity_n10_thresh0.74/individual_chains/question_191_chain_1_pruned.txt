Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then, through several steps, it goes through different reagents and conditions, and we need to find out what the final product looks like. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, let me break down each step. There are four main steps, so I'll tackle them one by one.

Step 1: The starting material is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Hmm. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent, typically an electrophile. So maybe this is an alkylation or some kind of substitution.

Looking at the starting molecule: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Its structure has a cyclohexanone ring with substituents. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an allyl group attached via the middle carbon, right? So that's CH2-C=CH2 attached to the ring.

So when sodium hydride is added, it's likely deprotonating something. Where? Maybe the hydroxymethyl's OH is acidic. Sodium hydride would deprotonate the OH, turning it into an O-.

Then, benzyl bromide (which is BrCH2Ph) would react. Since we have an O- after deprotonation, it's a good nucleophile. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide in an SN2 reaction. So we'd get an ether linkage: the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl-OCH2- group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is cyclohexanone with a hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) at C3. When we deprotonate that, the oxygen becomes negatively charged. Then, benzyl bromide (which is PhCH2Br) would provide a benzyl group. So the O- attacks the benzyl bromide, leading to an ether: the -CH2-O-PhCH2- group? Wait no, wait. Benzyl bromide is PhCH2Br, so when the O- attacks, it would form O-CH2-PhCH2-..., but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: the benzyl bromide is Ph-CH2-Br. So when O- attacks the benzyl bromide, it displaces Br- and forms O-CH2-Ph-CH2-... Wait, no, the structure would be O-CH2-Ph because the benzyl group is Ph-CH2-. So maybe the product is OCH2Ph attached where the OH was.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The starting material has a -CH2OH group. Sodium hydride deprotonates the -OH to form -CH2O^- Na+. Then, benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) would react with the O^-.

The mechanism would be: O^- attacks the benzyl bromide's carbon, leading to PhCH2-O-CH2... Wait, no, wait. The structure would be O-CH2Ph? Or O-PhCH2?

Wait, when we deprotonate the -CH2OH, we get -CH2O^- Na+. Then, benzyl bromide is Ph-CH2-Br. So when O^- attacks the adjacent carbon (the CH2 in benzyl bromide), the Br leaves. So the product would be Ph-CH2-O-CH2- attached where it was before. So in the cyclohexanone ring, the substituent at C3 would be OCH2Ph. So that's an ether group: the hydroxymethyl becomes a benzyl ether.

So product 1 is 3-(benzyloxy)methylcyclohexanone, but wait, wait. Let me think again. The starting group is -CH2OH. After deprotonation and alkylation, it becomes -CH2-O-CH2Ph. Or perhaps I should write it as -OCH2Ph attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, no. When the O^- attacks, it attacks the benzyl bromide's CH2Br. So the oxygen would have two CH2 groups attached? Let me draw it mentally.

The initial group is CH2OH. When deprotonated, it's CH2O^- Na+. Then, benzyl bromide (PhCH2Br) reacts: the O^- attacks the benzyl's carbon (CH2Br), so the product would be
