Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances, and I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance. Hmm, I've learned a bit about particle physics, but I need to think through this step by step.

The question gives me some data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And the options are all in terms of meters, so I'm guessing it's about how far the meson travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right! The uncertainty principle comes into play here. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (which is related to the width Γ) to the time uncertainty (the lifetime τ). The formula is something like ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

Wait, more accurately, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, since Γ is the energy width. Oh yeah, because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should make sure about the units. Let me think. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh, right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck's constant is in J·s, but I think the commonly used value in particle physics is in GeV·s.

So, Γ is given in MeV, which I need to convert to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

But wait, another thought. The decay length isn't just based on the lifetime. The particle is moving, so the decay distance is its speed multiplied by the
