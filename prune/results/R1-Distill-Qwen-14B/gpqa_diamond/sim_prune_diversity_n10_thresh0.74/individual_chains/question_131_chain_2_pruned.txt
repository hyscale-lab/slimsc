Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The problem says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride has some specific NMR spectra. Then, it reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.

First, let's break down the information.

Starting with the dicarboxylic acid. It has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would be based on the starting acid. Since the starting acid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride with a double bond.

Now, looking at the NMR data for the anhydride. Its 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons usually appear, but wait, anhydrides typically don't have aromatic protons. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated system or an alpha, beta-unsaturated anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkenyl proton. Another thought: maybe the 7 ppm peak is from a carbonyl group. No, wait, that's more like 170 ppm in 13C. Oh wait, 7 ppm is for protons, perhaps an olefinic proton. But the question says the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. So maybe it's a symmetrical system where all equivalent protons are showing a single peak.

In the 13C NMR, there are two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyls are usually around 170-220, but anhydride carbonyls are typically around 165-175. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon attached to a double bond, like a spÂ² carbon. So, the anhydride has two carbonyl carbons? Or maybe one carbonyl and another from the double bond.

Wait, the anhydride from a cis-diacid would have a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected via a double bond. For example, if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis-alkene. No, wait, the starting molecule is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, so after dehydration, it would lose water and form an an
