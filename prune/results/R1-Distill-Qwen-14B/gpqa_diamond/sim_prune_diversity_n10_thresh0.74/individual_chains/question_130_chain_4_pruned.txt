Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength. I remember that Lyman alpha is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range.

So, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, redshift... I think redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the z, the farther away the object is.

Wait, the Lyman alpha absorption happens at 1216 Angstroms. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see that wavelength because the Earth's atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light. So, the absorbed light must be redshifted into the optical range for us to detect it.

Right, so if the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but we observe it at a longer wavelength because of redshift. The formula I remember is observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z).

So, we need the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. What's the optical range? I think it's roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Converting that to Angstroms because the rest wavelength is given in Angstroms. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

But wait, the quasars are background objects, so their light is passing through the hydrogen clouds. The hydrogen absorbs at the rest wavelength (1216 Angstroms), but because of the quasar's redshift, the hydrogen's absorption feature would be observed at a longer wavelength. So, for the absorption to be in the optical, the observed wavelength should be less than 7000 Angstroms (700 nm).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The quasar emits light at various wavelengths, including Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, its emitted light is redshifted. So the Lyman alpha line we observe would be at 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms. 

But wait, the question is about the absorption. So the hydrogen cloud is in front of the quasar, so its own redshift would cause the absorption line to be at a certain wavelength. Or is it the quasar's redshift that matters?

Wait, no. The hydrogen clouds are the ones causing the absorption. So the quasar's light passes through these clouds, and the clouds' hydrogen absorbs at their own rest wavelength, but this absorption feature is then redshifted due to the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, but the quasar itself is at a certain redshift. If the cloud is in front of the quasar, the cloud's redshift would be lower than the quasar's. So, wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify: when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at a wavelength determined by the cloud's redshift.

So, the cloud must have a redshift such that the Lyman alpha absorption is shifted into the optical range, detectable by ground-based telescopes. Because if it's in the UV, the atmosphere blocks it, so we can't observe it from the ground.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength should be less than 7000 Angstroms (700 nm). So:

1216 * (1 + z) â‰¤ 7000

Wait, but the maximum wavelength we can
