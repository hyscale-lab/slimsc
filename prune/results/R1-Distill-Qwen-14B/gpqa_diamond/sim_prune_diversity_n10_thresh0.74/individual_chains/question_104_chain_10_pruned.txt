Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each hosting a planet similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shift in the spectral lines is given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, right? So the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us. The formula for K involves the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Oh, right, the formula is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) * ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) )) )) ... but wait, maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, since both stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass. So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the denominator would simplify, and the sin i is about 1 because the orbit is edge-on (but I don't know if that's given; the problem says circular orbits, but doesn't specify inclination. Oh, but the RV method usually measures the maximum velocity, so if the orbits are edge-on, sin i is 1. But maybe in this problem, we can assume that both have the same inclination, so the effect cancels out when comparing the two. So the ratio depends on other factors.

Let me think. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) ) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and M_p/M_* is negligible. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1)
