Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The next part talks about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. So, the question is about which two resonances are connected in the major product's NMR.

Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like based on the NMR data.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. Aromatic protons usually show up around there, but wait, it's a singlet. If it's a dienophile, maybe it's a substituted compound with equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with equivalent protons. Another thought: perhaps it's a symmetrical structure. So, the anhydride might have two equivalent groups.

Looking at the 13C NMR: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyl carbons are usually around 165-220 ppm. The 137 is likely a carbon with double bonds. So, the 165 is probably a carbonyl group, maybe an anhydride or ester. The 137 could be a carbon adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would likely be a cyclic anhydride because the starting acid has two carboxylic groups. For a cis-dicarboxylic acid, dehydration would form a bicyclic anhydride? Or maybe a maleic anhydride-like structure.

Wait, maleic anhydride has a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons, with a double bond between them. So, maybe that's what we have here. But wait, maleic anhydride's protons on the double bond are as a singlet? Let me think. The protons on the double bond in maleic anhydride are on adjacent carbons. But in cis structure, the protons would be on the same side. But wait, in maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The protons on the double bond (the two CH groups) would be split. Wait no, in maleic anhydride, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O
   ||
    C=C
   ||
O-C-O
     O

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The actual structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure with two double bonds. The structure is:

O
||
C-O-C-O
  |   |
  C   C
  ||   ||
  O   O

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw it mentally. The anhydride would have two carbonyl groups connected via an oxygen bridge. So, if the starting acid is cis, the resulting anhydride would have the two carbony
