Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4), and I remember that this is a two-component spinor, right? So it's a column vector in the Hilbert space for spin-½ particles.

Wait, the options are in terms of ħ, the reduced Planck's constant. And the expectation value formula involves the spin operator. I think the spin operator S_y for a spin-½ particle is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh right, the problem even gives σ_y as a matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) * σ_y. Yeah, that's right because S = ħ/2 σ for each component.

The state vector is (3i, 4). But wait, I should make sure it's normalized. Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2. The modulus of 3i is 3, so squared is 9. The modulus of 4 is 4, squared is 16. Adding them gives 25. So the norm is 5, so the state vector is (3i, 4)/5, because normalization requires dividing by the norm.

Wait, the given state is (3i,4), but when calculating expectation values, I should use the normalized vector. So the actual
