Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get tricky. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what it's asking.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. 

Next, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to get product 4, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Alright, let's break this down. I think it's a multi-step synthesis problem, so I need to figure out each step to find the structure of the final product.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornene structure. So the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

Reaction 1: Combining this with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide.

Hmm, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. This sounds like an elimination or substitution reaction.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons (since it's 5 and 6 positions). When sodium iodide is present, perhaps an SN2 substitution occurs. But wait, each of the dibromomethyl groups might undergo substitution with iodide.

Wait, but wait, sodium iodide (NaI) is a source of I- ions. So, perhaps each of the 5,6-dibromomethyl groups in the cyclohexadiene undergo substitution with iodide. So each Br would be replaced by I. But wait, if it's 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), that means each of the 5 and 6 positions has two Br atoms on a CH2 group. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2 after substitution?

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each CH2Br2 would have two Brs. If we have two equivalents of the diene, perhaps each diene molecule is reacting twice.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. When reacted with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, perhaps it's a [4+2] cyclo
