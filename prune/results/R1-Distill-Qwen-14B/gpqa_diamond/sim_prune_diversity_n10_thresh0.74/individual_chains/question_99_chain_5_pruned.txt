Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectra.

First, I'll look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Since carboxylic acids have both a C=O and an O-H, that fits. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The description says several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, which makes sense if it's a carboxylic acid. The NMR has two specific signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complicated, but let's think about splitting patterns.

Splitting in NMR occurs due to neighboring protons. A doublet of triplets suggests a proton next to two different sets of protons. Maybe each neighboring group has two or more protons. The first signal being a doublet of triplets of quartets sounds like a proton that's next to groups with multiple hydrogens, leading to more splitting.

Wait, the options all have similar structures. Let me look at them:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all of them seem to have a chain leading to a carboxylic acid. Let me visualize each structure.

Option D is CH3CH2-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups each attached to a CH3 and a C connected to COOH. So the structure is something like CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, more accurately, the backbone is CH2CH2-C(C H3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structures mentally.

Looking at each option:

Option A: The carboxylic acid is at the end, attached to a CH2. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle carbons has two substituents: a CH3 and a C2H5 group? Or wait, no, the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)... I think that each of the middle carbons is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So each of the two middle carbons has two substituents: CH3 and C2H5, and two Hs. So the structure is symmetrical? Like, maybe the two middle carbons each have CH3 and C2H5 groups and two Hs.

Wait, perhaps each of those middle carbons is attached to CH3, C2H5, and two Hs. So each is CH(CH3)(C2H5). Hmm, but in that case, the structure would be more like:

CH3-CH2-C(CH3)(C2H5)-CH(CH3)(C2H5)-COOH? No, wait the formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So it's CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the backbone is CH2-CH2-C...? Wait, no. Let me parse the formula correctly.

The formula for option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the backbone is CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So that's a four-carbon chain: the first is CH3, then CH2, then two middle carbons each with a H, a C2H5, and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps each middle carbon is CH(CH2CH3). So each is attached to
