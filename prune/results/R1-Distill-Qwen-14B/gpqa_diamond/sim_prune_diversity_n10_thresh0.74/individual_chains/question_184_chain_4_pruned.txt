Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of reaction steps. Hmm, I need to think this through carefully.

First, let's visualize the target molecule. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a hexagon, so numbering starts from one substituent. Let me draw this mentally. Position 1 has ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has tert-butyl (t-Bu), and position 3 has nitro (-NO2). So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene can be numbered such that the substituents are in the right positions. Alternatively, perhaps the correct numbering would have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 as meta to each other. Wait, no, benzene is symmetrical, but the substituents are at adjacent positions. Wait, 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So, the substituents are at ortho and meta positions. Hmm, but I'm more concerned about the order of reactions to get each substituent in the correct position.

So, the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Now, I need to think about the order in which these groups are introduced because the order affects the positions due to directing effects.

Benzene is the starting material. So, the first substitution will be introducing one group, then the next substitution will occur based on the directing effect of the first group, and so on.

Each substituent can be either activating or deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Nitro is a deactivating, meta director. tert-Butyl is a bulky, activating, but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director as well, but might have steric hindrance.

Wait, but when we're doing substitution reactions, the substituents that are already present on the ring will direct the incoming
