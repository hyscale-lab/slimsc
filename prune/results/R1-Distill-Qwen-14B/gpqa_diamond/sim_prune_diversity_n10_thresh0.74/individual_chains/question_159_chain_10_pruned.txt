Okay, so I have this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me think. The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm and a drop below that. I remember that the peak in the spectrum could relate to the Lyman-alpha forest or something else, but wait, the drop at shorter wavelengths—that's probably because of the Lyman-alpha forest. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines blueward of the Lyman-alpha emission line at 121.6 nm. But wait, the observed wavelength is much longer than that. Oh right, because of redshift.

So, the quasar's emission line is at 121.6 nm, but we observe it at 790 nm. That means the wavelength is stretched by a factor. Let me calculate the redshift. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, the rest is 121.6 nm. So the ratio is 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So the redshift z is approximately 5.5. Wait, because z = (observed - rest) / rest. So 790 - 121.6 = 668.4, divided by 121.6 gives about 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance is the distance to an object at redshift z, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = c * ∫(dz) / H(z), from 0 to z. But wait, because we're using the standard Lambda-CDM model with given parameters—H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m is 0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ is 0.7, and the universe is flat.

I think for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1, which it does here (0.3 +0.7=1). So, the comoving distance can be calculated using the integrals involving these parameters. But calculating the integral exactly would require some computation. I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance relates to the age of the universe and the Hubble parameter.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I
