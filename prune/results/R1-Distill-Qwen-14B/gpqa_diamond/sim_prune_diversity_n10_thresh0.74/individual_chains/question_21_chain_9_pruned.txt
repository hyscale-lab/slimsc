Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus is on two parts: determining which compound doesn't show tautomerism (part A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (part B).

The compounds given are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A, and for part B, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

So I need to break this down. First, I'll tackle part A: which of the two compounds does not exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism, as I remember, occurs when there's a shift of a hydrogen atom and the accompanying shift of a double bond from one position to another, resulting in different isomers. This typically happens in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups or in situations where such shifts are possible. For example, in compounds like o-phenylenediamine or in sugars, where keto-enol tautomerism occurs.

Looking at the two compounds in part A:

1. Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a quinone, which is a cyclic di-ketone. It has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Quinones can have different structures depending on the position of the ketones. Benzoquinone can exist as para-quinone (like 1,4-benzoquinone) or ortho-quinone (like 1,2-benzoquinone). But wait, does that relate to tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism is more about the movement of a hydrogen and a double bond. Benzoquinone, being a di-ketone, might not have the necessary adjacent groups for keto-enol tautomerism. Because for keto-enol, you usually have a carbonyl and an -OH or -NH group nearby. Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the structure allows for enol formation.

Wait, no, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have an -OH group, so it can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. It's a conjugated di-ketone. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let me think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring, at positions 1,3,5. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with three O=C-O groups. Wait, no, trione would have three ketone groups. So the molecule is O=C-C-O-C-C-O in a ring. Hmm, or maybe more accurately, each of the three alternate carbons has a ketone.

Wait, does the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione allow for enol tautomerism? I'm trying to remember. Enol tautomerism requires adjacent carbonyl groups because the hydrogen can shift from one carbon to another. So in a molecule with multiple carbonyl groups, like o-
