Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector in three-dimensional space, I think. Then there are two observables, P and Q, represented by their respective matrices.

The operator matrix for P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). And the Q matrix has first row (1, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). 

The question is about measuring P and then Q, specifically the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I need to find the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

Hmm, I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. So the process involves finding the eigenvalues of P and Q, then figuring out the probabilities.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix for P is 3x3. Let me write it out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But that might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns or symmetries. Let me think. The matrix P looks symmetric, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Looking at P, it's a tridiagonal matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1/sqrt(2) on the off-diagonal except for the corners. Wait, no, the first row middle element is 1/sqrt(2), same as others, but the second row has 1/sqrt(2) in the first and third positions.

Wait, another approach: sometimes such matrices have simple eigenvalues, maybe like 1 and -1, or something else. Let me compute the trace. The trace of P is 0 (since all diagonal elements are zero). So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

But maybe it's easier to compute the eigenvalues by finding eigenvectors. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry that allows it to be broken down into blocks or have known eigenvectors.

Wait, thinking about the structure, perhaps the eigenvectors are symmetric in some way. Let me consider if there's an eigenvector where all components are equal. Let’s say v = (a, a, a). Then P*v would be:

First component: 0*a + (1/√2)*a + 0*a = a/√2
Second component: (1/√2)*a + 0*a + (1/√2)*a = (2a)/√2 = a√2
Third component: 0*a + (1/√2)*a + 0*a = a/√2

So if we set that equal to λ*v, which would be (λ a, λ a, λ a), we get:

a/√2 = λ a → λ = 1/√2, provided a ≠ 0. But for the second component, a√2 = λ a → λ = √2. But √2 isn't equal to 1/√2, so that can't be. So that vector isn't an eigenvector.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. Suppose that λ is an eigenvalue, then the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) =0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant is:

| P - λ I | = -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row:

= -λ * det [ [ -λ, 1/√2 ], [1/√2, -λ ] ] 
- (1/√2) * det [ [1/√2, 1/√2 ], [0, -λ ] ] 
+ 0 * something

So first term: -λ [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - ( (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ] = - (1/√2) * [ -λ/(√2) ] = - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (λ)/(2)

So the determinant becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2 = 0

Expanding:

-λ³ + (λ)(1/2) + λ/2 = 0 → -λ³ + λ (1/2 + 1/2 ) = -λ³ + λ = 0.

So the equation is -λ³ + λ =0 → λ ( -λ² +1 )=0 → λ (1 - λ² )=0 → λ =0, λ=1, λ= -1.

Ah! So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1. That's much simpler than I thought. So the possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, -1.

Similarly, for Q, the matrix is diagonal: [[1,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues for Q are 1, 0, -1. Wait, no, the diagonal elements are 1, 0, -1. So yeah, the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. So first, when we measure P, we get 0, which means the state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to P=0. Then, in that new state, measure Q, and find the probability of getting -1.

So the process is:

1. Find
