Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the question is about mutations in a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound in barley. We need to figure out which mutation would eliminate this compound.

First, I remember that the gene is made up of exons and introns. The problem says there are five exons and four introns, but I'm not sure if that's crucial here. The key is probably looking at the mutations in the target gene.

The intact gene sequence is provided, along with four mutants. The goal is to find which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the compound.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have some changes in the first exon area. So, the first exon must be where the mutations occurred. But how do these mutations affect the gene?

I think about how mutations can disrupt a gene. Nonsense mutations (stop codons) or frameshifts would likely cause a nonfunctional protein. But in this case, all the mutations are point mutations because each line shows a single change in the sequence. So, maybe one of these changes creates a premature stop codon.

Let's look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATG TTT CTG CGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …TGA-3'

Wait, the starting is ATG, which is the start codon. Then, the next codon is TTT (Phe), then CTG (Leu), etc.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …TGA-3'

Wait, let me parse the sequences. Let me write them out in triplets to see the codons.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTG CGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …

Wait, but in the given sequences, each line is written as such. Let me see the exact positions.

Mutant 1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... I think I need to compare each spot. Let's see.

Looking at the first part of the wild type:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTG CGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ...

Wait, perhaps I should write out each codon.

Wait, in the wild type, the first few codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTG (Leu), CGG (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TTCT (but that's 4 bases, maybe I should group into triplets). Wait, perhaps the initial part is:

Wild type: 5’-ATG TTT CTG CGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …TGA-3’

So, the fourth codon is CGG (Arg), fifth TAC (Tyr), sixth TT
