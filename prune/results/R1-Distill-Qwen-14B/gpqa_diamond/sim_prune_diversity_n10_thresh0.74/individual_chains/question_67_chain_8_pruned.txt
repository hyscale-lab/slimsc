Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to think it through step by step. So the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum states are represented by quantum numbers, and when you have multiple particles, you have to consider the combined state.

The problem says the coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So I think that's |l1, l2, l, m>. Here, l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Each p orbital has l=1, so that makes sense since both are p orbitals. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, so when you combine two l=1's, you can get l=2,1,0. That's how angular momentum addition works, right? So the total state is |l=2, m= -1>.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. Wait, L1z and L2z are the individual orbital angular momentum components for each electron. Each Lz has eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. So for each electron, since l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So the eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

So the measurement we're considering is both electrons having Lz eigenvalues of -ħ. That is, m1 = m2 = -1. Then, what is the probability of this?

But wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, but to find the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1, I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis (i.e., the product of individual states with definite m1 and m2).

So the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is expressed as a combination of |m1, m2> states. The expansion coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right? Or maybe it's easier to think about how the total state can be broken down into all possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to m = -1.

Wait, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = m = -
