Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

So, the problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. Right, so when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their rest frames are important here.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so higher gamma means higher speed.

But wait, the rest masses are the same for both. An electron and a positron have the same mass, so their rest energies are equal. The electron's gamma is 4, so its total energy is gamma * m c², and the positron's is 2 * m c². Because they're moving towards each other, their momenta will be opposite in direction but depend on their gamma and velocity.

So when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the problem says both photons have the same energy, that might help in figuring out their directions and the angle between them.

Wait, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis. The angle between them would be the angle each makes with the x-axis multiplied by two, perhaps?

Let me think about conservation of momentum and energy. The initial system has the electron and positron moving. Let's set up the coordinate system with the origin at the point of collision. The x-axis is the horizontal direction they're moving along. The y-axis is vertical.

So, before collision, the electron is moving to the right (since it's going from left to right) with gamma_e =4, and the positron is moving to the left (from right) with gamma_p =2.

Wait, no, wait. The electron is moving along the horizontal from the left, so its velocity is positive
