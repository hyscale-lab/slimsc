Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

Hmm, the spin state given is (3i, 4). I think this is a column vector representing the quantum state, so it's written as a two-component spinor. So the state vector is χ = [3i; 4]. Wait, yeah, because electrons are spin-1/2 particles, their spin states are two-dimensional.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨χ| A |χ⟩, where A is the operator in question. In this case, A is S_y, the spin operator along the y-axis.

I remember that the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle are given in terms of the Pauli matrices, multiplied by ħ/2. So the Pauli matrix σ_y is given in the note. Let me write that down:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. Therefore, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, to find the expectation value, I need to compute χ† S_y χ. Let's break this down.

First, let's compute χ†. Since χ is [3i; 4], the conjugate transpose (dagger) of χ, χ†, would be [ -3, 4 ] because I take the complex conjugate of each element and transpose the vector into a row vector.

So χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Next, I'll compute the product χ† multiplied by σ_y. Let me write that out as a matrix multiplication.

σ_y is a 2x2 matrix, and χ is a 2x1 vector. So when I multiply χ† (which is 1x2) by σ_y (2x2), I get a 1x2 vector.

Let me compute each element of the resulting vector.

First element (row 1, column 1 of the product):
(-3)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element (row 1, column 2 of the product):
(-3)(-i) + (4)(0) = 3i + 0 = 3i.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Actually, the multiplication is χ† * σ_y. χ† is a row vector, and σ_y is a 2x2 matrix. So the multiplication is [a b] * [[c d],[e f]] which becomes [a c + b e, a d + b f].

Wait, let me correct the calculation. σ_y is:

0   -i
i    0

So χ† is [ -3, 4 ].

Multiply each element of χ† with each column of σ_y.

First element (row 1, column 1 of the product):
(-3) * 0 + 4 * i = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element (row 1, column 2):
(-3) * (-i) + 4 * 0 = 3i + 0 = 3i.

So the product χ† σ_y is [4i, 3i].

Then, I need to multiply this resulting row vector by χ, which is [3i; 4]. So it's a 1x2 multiplied by a 2x1, giving a scalar (the expectation value).

So the multiplication is (4i)*(3i) + (3i)*(4).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (4i)*(3i) = 12 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (3i)*(4) = 12i.

So the total is (-12) + 12i. Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because the expectation value should be a
