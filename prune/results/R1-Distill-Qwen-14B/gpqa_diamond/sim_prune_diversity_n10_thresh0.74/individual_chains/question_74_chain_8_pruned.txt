Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that we have a single atom, and we want to observe its decay. We obtained it, maybe from a beta decay of another atom, and started monitoring right away. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. The question is asking, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, wait. So, it's been 50 minutes, and the atom is still there. Now, we're looking at the next 150 minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial probability given is for 100 minutes, 32% chance. I think I need to find the probability over 200 minutes, but considering that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by P = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The decay probability is 1 - P.

Wait, so the decay probability in a certain time is 32% for 100 minutes. Let me relate that. So, the given probability is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Then, taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So, λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate that. Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately... Hmm, ln(1)=0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, and 0.68 is close to 0.7. ln(0.7) is about -0.356. So, ln(0.68) is even more negative, maybe around -0.400? Let me check with calculator steps. Alternatively, I can just proceed symbolically.

So, λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100. Wait, because ln(0.68) is negative, so when I take negative, it becomes positive. So, λ = ln(1/0.68)/100. Wait, 1/0.68 is approximately 1.47. So ln(1.47) is about 0.385. So λ ≈ 0.385 / 100 = 0.00385 per minute.

Now, the question is about the probability after the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have already passed without decay. So, the total time would be 200 minutes, but I think the key is that the decay is memoryless. Oh right, radioactive decay has the memoryless property. So, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed for t' minutes, is the same as if it just started.

Wait, so the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next 150. Because each moment is independent. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we started fresh and are looking at 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. The given data is for 100 minutes being 32% decay. But the question is, what's the probability for 150 minutes, considering that 50 are already over.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the decay constant
