Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic NMR, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Also, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethyl compound. So, the possible answers are options A, B, C, D.

Alright, let me break this down.

First, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check each option's molecular formula. All the tetramethylbenzenes would have 4 methyl groups, so the formula is C8H10 plus 4*(CH3) which is C8+4= C12? Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, wait each methyl is C1, so benzene is C6. So for tetramethylbenzene, it's C6 +4 C's = C10. And each methyl adds 3 H each, so 4*3=12 H. Benzene has 6 H normally, but when substituted, it depends on substitution pattern.

Wait, but the molecular formula given is C10H14. So let me calculate: Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3, so adding one methyl would make C7H7. Wait, no, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl adds a CH3. So for tetramethylbenzene, the formula would be C6 +4C= C10, and H: 6 (from benzene) minus 4*1 (for each substitution) plus 4*3 (from methyl groups). Wait, substitution replaces a H. So each methyl substitution replaces one H. So the general formula for monosubstituted benzene is C7H8. Wait, but wait, benzene has 6 H, so when you substitute with a methyl, you have 5 H on the ring. So, C6H5-CH3 is C7H8, correct. So for each substitution
