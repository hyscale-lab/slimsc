Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t for a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along some trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at a later time t, which is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. 

Wait, so I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But for potentials, I think we have expressions that take into account the time delay because the fields propagate at the speed of light. Oh right, that's due to the retarded time concept.

The scalar potential, V, and vector potential, A, are usually given by certain integrals involving the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. Right, the potentials are functions of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time, which is the time when the charge was at a position such that the emitted fields would just reach the observation point r at time t.

So the standard formula for the scalar potential when a charge is stationary is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, the potential still depends on the charge's position at the retarded time, but I think the formula remains somewhat similar, but with adjustments for the velocity.

Wait, no. Let's recall the exact expressions. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V(r, t) = q/(4πε₀) * (1/|r' - d|), where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time, or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the displacement vector d.

Wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So that would make d = r - r(tr), where r(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr. But wait, the problem states that d is from the field generating point to r, so d = r - r(tr).

Wait, but when I look at the options, some have terms like (dc - d·v). Oh, because when the charge is moving, the denominator involves the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position to the observation point. So the denominator will include factors of the velocity of the charge.

So the expression for the scalar potential would involve some denominator that accounts for the displacement due to the charge's motion. Let me think: the time delay τ is such that t = tr + |d|/c, since the field takes time |d|/c to reach from the charge's position at tr to the point r. But wait, actually, if the charge is moving, the time delay isn't just |d|/c because the charge might have moved closer or further away. So the correct way to model this is using the displacement d and the velocity v.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to write down the general expressions. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is:

V(r, t) = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 /
