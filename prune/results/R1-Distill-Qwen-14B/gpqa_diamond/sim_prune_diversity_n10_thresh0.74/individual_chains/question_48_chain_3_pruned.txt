Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's break it down.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine, which is Br2. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has the carbonyl group. When you add bromine to a ketone, it's probably a dibromination at the alpha positions. Oh right! The alpha positions are the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons, each with two H's. But wait, no, wait: cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone on one carbon. So the alpha carbons are the two adjacent to the carbonyl, each having two H's. So when bromine is added, it's an alpha bromination. But wait, in this case, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So adding Br2 with, I think, a peroxide or something would lead to allylic bromination, but that's for alkenes. Hmm. Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm mixing reactions. Alternatively, bromine could be adding across the carbonyl group, but that's not common with ketones. Oh wait, maybe it's a different kind of addition. Wait
