Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me think this through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to check each one for the possibility of optical activity. Optical activity occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Alternatively, some compounds might have planes or centers of symmetry that make them achiral despite having stereogenic elements. So, I'll go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Let me draw the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, C1 has a Cl and a double bond to C2, which has a methyl group and another substituent.

   Structure: Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond at position 1. Wait, that can't be right. Let me get this straight. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would substitute a Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl on C1 would give Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but the substituents on the double bond are the Cl and the methyl group.

   Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused about the structure. Let's think again: the formula is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group and another substituent. So the groups attached to C2 are CH(CH3), and perhaps a CH2 from one side.

   Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl–C(=CH2)–CH(CH3). Hmm, that might not be right. Maybe better to think in terms of substituents. For a double bond, each carbon can have two substituents. So in this case, at C1 (the first carbon), the substituents are Cl and the double bond. At C2, the substituents are CH(CH3) and another CH2 group.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the actual structure. The molecule is 1-chloro
