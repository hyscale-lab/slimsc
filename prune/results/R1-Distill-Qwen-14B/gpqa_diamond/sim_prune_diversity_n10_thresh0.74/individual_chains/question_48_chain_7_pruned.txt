Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Let me start by breaking down each step to see what's happening.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. So, the first step is treating it with bromine. Hmm, what reaction does bromine typically do with ketones? Oh wait, it's probably the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but wait, that's for α bromination of carboxylic acids. Or wait, no—bromine adds to ketones in a different way. Oh, right, the benzilic acid rearrangement? Or maybe it's more straightforward. Oh wait, maybe it's just an addition of bromine across the carbonyl group, but wait, ketones don't usually add bromine like alkenes do. Wait, maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, another thought: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent, it might undergo a bromination at the alpha position. Oh! The alpha bromination. So, cyclohexanone, when treated with Br2, would form a brominated cyclohexanone. But wait, how does that happen? I think it's the acid-catalyzed bromination where the carbonyl becomes a better leaving group. So, cyclohexanone would form a bromo derivative at the alpha position
