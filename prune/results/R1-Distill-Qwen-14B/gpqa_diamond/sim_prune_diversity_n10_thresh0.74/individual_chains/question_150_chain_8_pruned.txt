Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted with a series of reagents, and I need to determine the final product from the options given. Hmm.

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking that down, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be from a ring and some double bonds or triple bonds. Since the NMR shows aromatic protons, probably a benzene ring is involved. So maybe that's one ring (3 degrees), and then perhaps two double bonds or another ring and a double bond.

Now the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) integrating for 1H. High upfield, around 9.7. Wait, that's a bit high, but maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So that would suggest an aldehyde group. Then a tripletâ€”so two neighboring protons. Hmm, but aldehydes have only one proton. Oh wait, but if it's part of a conjugated system, maybe coupling with two protons on adjacent carbons? Or perhaps it's a coupling with two other protons elsewhere.

Next, the rest of the NMR: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating for two protons. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but it's 2H each. So perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but in such a way that each substituent is ortho or para. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with two groups attached.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests maybe some exchange or coupling with multiple protons, or perhaps it's near an electron-withdrawing group. Singlet implies no neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe an aromatic ring with two substituents in a way that those protons are isolated.

3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet for two protons. That suggests two protons adjacent to a group that splits them into a doublet. Maybe an OCH2 group? Because OCH2 would have two protons next to an electronegative atom, causing splitting. So maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen.

Putting this all together. Let's imagine the structure. The aldehyde (from 9.72 ppm) is at one end. Then perhaps a chain with some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let's say the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring. But the formula doesn't add up. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Our compound is C8H9NO. Hmm, perhaps a substituted benzaldehyde with an amine or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 9.72 (1H), maybe the aldehyde proton. Then perhaps a CH2 group next to it. So the structure could be something like R-CHO with R having substituents.

Wait, another approach: look at the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. Aqueous KOH, Heat

NaNO
