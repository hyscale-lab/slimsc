Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm.

Wait, in our universe, magnets naturally have both poles; you can't have just a single pole. But the question says in this parallel universe, you can have isolated North or South poles. That probably means that the concept of magnetic monopoles exists here. Oh right, magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that act as isolated north or south magnetic poles.

Now, Maxwell's equations as we know them are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall what each one says.

The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε ∂E/∂t

In our universe, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, holds because there are no magnetic monopoles. It states that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero, implying that the magnetic field lines form closed loops with no beginning or end. So, if we had magnetic monopoles, this equation would change, right?

If there are isolated monopoles, like individual north or south poles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, ∇·B would equal some function related to the monopole density. So equation 2 would change.

But wait, the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different in this scenario. So equation 2 is definitely different. Are any others affected?

Let me think about the other equations. The first equation deals with electric charges and the electric field, so monopoles are about magnetism, not electricity. So equation 1 remains the same.

Equation 3, Faraday's Law, deals with how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields. Since the existence of monopoles doesn't directly affect this law, because Faraday's Law is about how B changes over time, maybe this equation remains the same. Unless there's some change in how B behaves, but I think Faraday's Law is about the curl of E, so it's more about how B changes, not the sources of B.

Equation 4 is Ampère's Law, which relates the curl of the magnetic field to current and displacement current. If the sources of B are different (monop
