Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in parsecs. So d = 1/p. Oh wait, right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond. So if p is in arcseconds, d in parsecs is 1/p.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. That probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars per volume is constant. But wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It's asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/dp) changes with p.

Wait, so we need to find dN/dp, the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let me think. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. But how does that translate into parallax?

Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d. The volume of this shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², and the thickness is dr. So volume element is 4πd² dr.

The number of stars in this shell would be N = n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

Now, parallax p is 1/d. So d = 1/p. Let's see, if I change variables from d to p, I need to express dr in terms of dp.

Since d = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as d increases, p decreases. But for our purposes, I think we can just take the absolute value, so dr = (1/p²) dp.

So substituting d = 1/p into the number of stars in the shell:

N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp)

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. d is 1/p, so d
