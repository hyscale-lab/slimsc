Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so what gases have equal protons and neutrons? Well, a molecule with same number of p and n—so for example, if it's a diatomic gas, like O2, but wait, O has 8 protons. The neutrons would have to be 8 as well, making the isotope O-16. O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would be O-O, each with 8n and 8p. Wait, no, each molecule would have 16 neutrons because each O has 8, so two atoms make 16. But the problem states that the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule has 2*8=16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, O2 would fit. But another possibility is H2O? No, because H2O is a triatomic molecule. Wait, but the problem says gas W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think—if the molecule is O2, that would have 16p and 16n, so same. That fits. Another option is NH3? No, that's a liquid at some temps but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? Let's see: each CO2 has 1 C (6p, 6n) and 2 O's (8p each, 8n each). So total for CO2: 6+16 =22p, 6+16=22n. So same number. So that could also be a possibility. Wait, but CO2 is a gas but under standard conditions, it's a liquid or gas? I think CO2 is a gas at standard conditions. So which one is more likely?

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like CH4? No, because CH4 has 6p (C) + 4(1p) =10p, and C has 6n, each H has 1n. So 6 +4(1) =10n. So same. That would fit as well. So the molecule would be CH4, which has 10p and 10n. So that also fits. So possible options are O2, CO2, CH4, etc.

Wait, the problem says the gas is released when X reacts with Y. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is 4°C). So B has a melting point around 4°C. What substances have that melting point? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is a different product.
