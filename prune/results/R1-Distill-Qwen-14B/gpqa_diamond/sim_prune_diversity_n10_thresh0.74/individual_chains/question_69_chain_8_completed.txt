Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember from my classes that particle physics involves a lot of calculations with lifetimes, speeds, and such. Let me try to think through this.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is 8e-16 seconds. They want the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the question exactly asking? They're talking about the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the spatial resolution of the Bubble Chamber. Because when particles decay, they leave tracks, and the chamber has to be able to detect these tracks clearly. So the resolution probably needs to be small enough to capture the decay products within a certain length so that they can be observed.

I remember something about the lifetime of a particle affecting how far it travels before decaying. The formula I think is the length L = gamma * c * tau_0. Gamma here is the Lorentz factor, which comes from special relativity because the particle is moving at a high speed, close to the speed of light.

Wait, gamma is calculated as gamma = E/(m c²), right? Because E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So if the energy E is much larger than the rest mass, gamma would be large.

Oh, wait, the mass is given in GeV, and the energy is 27 GeV. So E is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²) but in units where c=1, probably in GeV terms.

Wait, but in natural units (like when using GeV for mass and energy), c is 1, so the formula simplifies. So gamma would be E/m. So in this case, gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28, so approximately 8. That's a rough calculation, but it's about 7.92, approximately 8.

So gamma is about 8. Then, the lifetime in the lab frame (the frame of the bubble chamber) is gamma * tau_0. Because from the lab's perspective, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 8 * 8e-16 s = 6.4e-15 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Gamma is 8, tau_0 is 8e-16 s. So 8 * 8e-16 is 6.4e-15 seconds. But wait, no, wait, is that correct? Because tau_0 is the proper time, so yes, lab frame time is longer by gamma.

Once we have the lab frame lifetime, the particle can travel a distance L = gamma * c * tau_0. Because the speed v is approximately c, so L = v * tau_lab ≈ c * tau_lab.

Wait, but tau_lab is gamma * tau_0, so L = gamma * c * tau_0.

Let me compute that. Let's compute c in meters per second: c is about 3e8 m/s. Tau_0 is 8e-16 s. Gamma is 8.

So L = 8 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 8e-16 s is (3 * 8) * 1e8 * 1e-16 = 24 * 1e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Then multiply by gamma, which is 8: 8 * 2.4e-7 = 1.92e-6 meters. Hmm, that's 1.92e-6 meters, which is 1.92 micrometers.

Wait, but the question isn't about the average path length; it's about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, right, because not all particles decay within the chamber, but only a fraction. So the number of particles that decay in the chamber depends on how long they live in the lab frame and the length of the chamber.

Wait, no, the resolution is about the chamber's ability to detect the decay point. But perhaps the problem is about the requirement for the chamber's spatial resolution so that the decay products can be detected.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says, "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So, I think the number refers to the fraction of particles that decay within the chamber's ability to detect, meaning that the chamber must be able to pinpoint the decay point with enough precision.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So, if the decay length is L, then the probability that a particle decays within a certain length x is (x/L), assuming x is much less than L.

Wait, no, the decay probability is actually P = 1 - exp(-x/L), where x is the length the particle travels. But perhaps for small x compared to L, this approximates to P ≈ x/L.

Wait, but in this problem, we might be considering that the minimum decay path is such that a certain fraction (30%) of the decays are observed. So perhaps we want the decay length L such that 30% of the particles decay within a certain length, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, another approach: the number of decays observed depends on the fraction that decay within the Bubble Chamber's volume. But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum spatial separation needed to distinguish the decay vertex from the interaction point, so that the decay can be observed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum measurement resolution (delta) such that the decay can be resolved. The resolution (delta) refers to the precision with which the decay position can be determined. The decay length L must be larger than delta for it to be observed. So perhaps the minimum delta is 30% of L. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the maximum length the particle travels before decaying, and the resolution must be better than a certain fraction of that length to capture the decay.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the average decay length and the required resolution. Let me think.

Wait, let's compute the decay length L as I did earlier. L = gamma * c * tau_0.

Gamma is 8, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 8 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Wait, let me compute that. 8 * 3e8 is 2.4e9. Multiply by 8e-16 gives (2.4e9) * (8e-16) = 19.2e-7 m = 1.92e-6 m, which is 1.92 micrometers.

So the average decay length is about 1.92e-6 meters. Now, to observe 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution needs to be such that we can detect a displacement of at least 30% of the decay length. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the number refers to the fraction of particles that decay within a certain path length, which depends on the resolution. The resolution is the smallest displacement the chamber can detect. So if the resolution is delta, then the fraction of particles decaying within delta is (delta/L), assuming that delta is much smaller than L.

Wait, but the question says "at least 30%". So we need P >= 0.3. So (delta / L) >= 0.3, so delta >= 0.3 * L.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Because the decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-x/L), where x is the length the particle travels. So for x = delta, the probability is P = 1 - exp(-delta/L).

But if delta is much smaller than L, then exp(-delta/L) ≈ 1 - delta/L. So P ≈ delta/L. So if we have delta/L = 0.3, then P ≈ 0.3. So delta = 0.3 L.

But wait, let's compute L first.

L = gamma * c * tau_0.

Gamma is 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 7.9178 ≈ 8.

So L = 8 * (3e8 m/s) * (8e-16 s).

Calculate that: 8 * 8 = 64. 3e8 * 8e-16 = 3 * 8 * 1e8 * 1e-16 = 24 * 1e-8 = 2.4e-7 m. Then multiply by 8: 64 * 2.4e-7 = 1.536e-5 m? Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, L is gamma * c * tau_0.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9178.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 7.9178 * 3e8 * 8e-16.

Multiplying 3e8 by 8e-16 gives 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9178: 7.9178 * 2.4e-7 ≈ 19.003e-7 m ≈ 1.9003e-6 m.

So L ≈ 1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9 micrometers.

So if the resolution delta is 30% of L, then delta = 0.3 * 1.9e-6 = 5.7e-7 m, which is 0.57 micrometers. But looking at the options, the closest is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A. Wait, but that's larger than my calculation here.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution being the mean path length multiplied by some factor.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution is such that the particle's decay path is at least 30% of the mean path length. So the resolution must be at least 0.3 * L.

Wait, but L is 1.9e-6 m. 0.3 * L is 5.7e-7 m, which is 0.57e-6 m, or 570 nm. But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a step. Because the lifetime is given as 8e-16 s, but if gamma is about 8, then the lab lifetime is 8 * 8e-16 = 6.4e-15 s. The decay length L is c * tau_lab, because in the lab frame, the particle moves at speed v ≈ c for high energies.

So L = c * tau_lab = (3e8 m/s) * 6.4e-15 s = (3e8) * (6.4e-15) = 1.92e-6 m, which is 1.92 micrometers. So that's the same result as before.

So the mean decay length is about 1.92 micrometers. So if the resolution is 30% of that, the minimum delta is 0.3 * 1.92e-6 = 5.76e-7 m, which is 0.576e-6 m, or 576 nm. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the requirement that the chamber's resolution must be smaller than a certain value so that it can detect the decay. So if the decay length is L, the resolution delta must be less than L to be able to detect the decay. But that doesn't directly tie into the 30% part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum path length that ensures that 30% of the particles decay within the chamber's observation length. So if the chamber has a certain length, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution, but no, the question is about spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum angular resolution, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another thought: the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The decay length L is gamma c tau_0. So if the chamber's resolution is delta, then the fraction of decays observed would be (delta/L). To observe at least 30%, delta must be at least 0.3 * L.

So delta = 0.3 * L = 0.3 * 1.92e-6 m = 5.76e-7 m. But the options are 2.08e-6 m (A), 2.08e-9 m (B), 2.08e-1 m (C), etc. So none of the options match 5.76e-7 m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps 30% is the efficiency, so perhaps the required delta is 30% of the mean decay length. But that would give 0.576e-6 m, which is 5.76e-7 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the decay length again. Gamma is 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let's compute that accurately.

27 / 3.41. Let's compute:

3.41 * 7 = 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 * 8 = 27.28, which is more than 27. So 27/3.41 ≈ 7.915.

So gamma ≈7.915.

Then L = gamma * c * tau_0.

c = 3e8 m/s.

Tau_0 =8e-16 s.

So L = 7.915 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.915: 2.4e-7 *7.915 ≈ 1.90e-6 m. So L≈1.9e-6 m.

Wait, so 1.9e-6 m is 1.9 micrometers.

Now, 30% of that is 0.57 micrometers, or 5.7e-7 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is looking for the minimum resolution in terms of the mean path length, not a percentage.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. That's close to the mean decay length I calculated (1.9e-6 m). So perhaps the minimum resolution needed is of the order of the decay length.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays." So if the chamber can't resolve a displacement smaller than 2 micrometers, then perhaps it can't detect the decay in a significant number of cases. But that's just a guess.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers, a bit larger than the L I calculated. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV again. 27 / 3.41 = approximately 7.9178.

So gamma is 7.9178.

Then L = gamma * c * tau_0.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 =8e-16 s.

So L =7.9178 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 first: 24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9178: 2.4e-7 *7.9178 ≈ 1.9003e-6 m.

So 1.9003e-6 m is 1.9003 micrometers.

The options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m.

So the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, but why would the answer be that?

Perhaps because the formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Wait, I think I might have missed the beta factor here. Because the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. But the length L is v * tau_lab. Since v = beta c, L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which simplifies to gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot to include the beta factor. So earlier I used L = gamma * c tau_0. But perhaps I should have used beta * gamma * c tau_0.

Wait, because the lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0, and the speed is beta c, so the length is v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau_0 = gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, but then I need to find beta.

Beta is v/c. And from gamma, we can find beta.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1-beta²).

So gamma^2 = 1/(1-beta²) → 1 - beta² = 1/gamma² → beta² = 1-1/gamma^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Given gamma is 7.9178, so 1/gamma² ≈ 1/62.7 ≈ 0.016.

So beta² is 1 - 0.016 = 0.984 → beta ≈ sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992.

So beta is about 0.992.

So then, L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

So substituting, L =7.9178 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.9178 *0.992 ≈ 7.864.

Then 3e8 *8e-16 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.864: 2.4e-7 *7.864 ≈1.9e-6 m. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, so including beta doesn't change the result much, as beta is close to 1.

So perhaps the calculation is correct as before.

So the decay length is about 1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9 micrometers. So the minimum resolution should be on the order of that. But the options have option A as 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Close enough.

But why is the answer option A? Because 2.08e-6 m is approximately the decay length. So the minimum resolution needed is about the same as the mean decay length, to be able to observe the decay in a significant number of cases.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the fraction is 30%, so maybe the delta should be 0.3 * L. But that gives 0.57e-6 m, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's requirement.

Wait, another approach: the number of decays observed depends on the decay length and the chamber's dimensions. But perhaps the question is about the minimum spatial resolution (delta) that allows the decay products to be distinguished from the original particle's path. So the resolution must be at least such that the decay vertex can be resolved.

If the decay length is L, and the resolution is delta, then perhaps the minimum delta required is such that the decay products are at least delta away from the original track. So as long as delta is less than L, you can see the decay. But how does the 30% come into play?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution such that 30% of the particles decay within a displacement that is greater than the resolution, so the chamber can detect them. So the probability that a decay occurs within delta is P = (delta)/(gamma c tau_0).

So P >=0.3 → delta >=0.3 * L.

But L is 1.9e-6 m, so delta >= 0.3 *1.9e-6 = 5.7e-7 m. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the mean path length being L = c tau_0 gamma, and the minimum delta is 30% of that. But that's what I did earlier.

Given that the options don't match 5.7e-7, but option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 1.9e-6 m, perhaps the question intended to have that as the answer, neglecting the 30% part and just asking for the decay length.

But the question says "at least 30% of the decays". Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The proper lifetime is tau_0, and in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. The average distance traveled is c * gamma tau_0.

But to have 30% of the decays observed, perhaps the minimum delta is the length such that the probability of the decay being within delta is 30%, which is P = 0.3 = (1 - exp(-delta/(c gamma tau_0))).

But solving for delta would require some approximation. Let's make an approximation for small delta compared to L.

Assume delta << L → exp(-delta/L) ≈ 1 - delta/L.

So P ≈ delta/L.

Set P=0.3 → delta=0.3 L.

Which is what I thought earlier.

So delta is 0.3 * (gamma c tau_0) = 0.3 * L.

So delta =0.3 * 1.9e-6 m =5.7e-7 m.

But again, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is being done with gamma=8, which would make L=8 *3e8 *8e-16.

Let me compute that: 8 *3e8 =2.4e9; 8e-16 *2.4e9 = 2.4e9 *8e-16 =1.92e-6 m. So with gamma=8, L is 1.92e-6 m.

So delta=0.3 *1.92e-6 =5.76e-7 m. Still not matching any option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Which is 2080e-9 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

E =27 GeV =27 *1e9 eV.

m=3.41 GeV =3.41 *1e9 eV.

So gamma = E/(m c²). But in units where c=1 and E and m are in the same units (like GeV), gamma = E/(m) →27/3.41 ≈7.917.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the energy E is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh, wait, that's a possibility I might have missed. Because sometimes when energy is given as 'energy of the particle', it could refer to the kinetic energy. If that's the case, then the total energy would be E_total = K + m c².

But the problem says, "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. So perhaps E is the total energy.

Alternatively, if E is the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be E_total = m c² + K = 3.41 GeV +27 GeV =30.41 GeV.

Then gamma = E_total / (m c²) =30.41 /3.41 ≈8.9.

Hmm, that would change the gamma value a bit.

Let me compute that. 30.41 divided by 3.41:

3.41 *8 =27.28.

3.41 *8.9= 3.41*(8 +0.9) =27.28 +3.069=30.349, which is about 30.35, very close to 30.41. So gamma is approximately 8.9 in that case.

So then L =gamma * beta * c tau_0.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma=8.9 → 1/gamma²≈1/79.21≈0.01262.

So beta²=1-0.01262=0.98738 → beta≈0.9936.

So L=8.9 *0.9936 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 8.9 *0.9936 ≈8.845.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.845: 8.845 *2.4e-7 ≈2.1228e-6 m.

So L≈2.1228e-6 m, which is 2.1228 micrometers.

So delta=0.3 * L= 0.3 *2.1228e-6 ≈6.368e-7 m.

Hmm, that's about 0.637 micrometers. Still not matching any option.

But wait, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. Which is close to the L when gamma is 8.9.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to compute the mean decay length and take that as the resolution. So the minimum resolution needed is the mean decay length, which is L=2.12e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is very close.

So perhaps the problem expects us to take gamma as 8 (for simplification), leading to L=1.92e-6 m, but the options have 2.08e-6, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation used gamma as (27 GeV)/(3 GeV) =9, leading to L=9 *3e8 *8e-16 = 2.16e-6 m. Which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, 27 GeV /3 GeV=9. So if the mass was taken as 3 GeV instead of 3.41, gamma would be 9.

So L=9 *3e8 *8e-16 = 9 *2.4e-7 m =2.16e-6 m, which is 2.16 micrometers. So option A is 2.08e-6, which is close to 2.16e-6.

So perhaps the problem uses gamma=8, but the calculation ends up as 2.08e-6 m. Let me check.

Wait, if gamma=8, then L=8 *3e8 *8e-16 = 8 *2.4e-7 =1.92e-6 m.

But 1.92e-6 is 1.92 micrometers, which isn't an option. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Gamma is 27 /3.41 =7.9178.

So L=7.9178 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m.

7.9178 *2.4e-7 = approx 7 *2.4e-7 is 1.68e-6, plus 0.9178 *2.4e-7 ≈ 2.2e-7 → total approx 1.9e-6 m.

Hmm. So I'm getting stuck because the options don't have 1.9e-6, which is what I calculate, but option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum delta so that the number of decays observed is 30% of the total. So the number of decays N is given by N = N0 (1 - exp(-x/L)), where x is the length over which the chamber is observing.

But if the chamber's length is large, x >> L, then N ≈ N0 (x/L). To have N=0.3 N0, x must be 0.3 L.

But if the chamber has a finite length, say longer than L, then all particles will decay, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the ability to measure the decay point within a certain precision.

Wait, perhaps the minimum delta is such that the decay can be seen as a separate track. So the delta must be less than L. But again, I'm not sure.

Given that the options don't match the 0.3*L calculation, and the closest option to the L calculation is A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers, perhaps that's the intended answer.

So perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the mean decay length without considering the 30% part, and that's option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we start by calculating the decay length \( L \), which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The decay length is given by:

\[
L = \gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \) is the proper lifetime of \( X^0 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy of the particle, and \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass of \( X^0 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9178
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
Substituting \( \gamma \), \( c \), and \( \tau_0 \) into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = 7.9178 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16})
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} = 24 \times 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]

Now multiply by \( 7.9178 \):

\[
L = 7.9178 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.9003 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the decay length is approximately:

\[
L \approx 1.90 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Minimum resolution for 30% of decays
To observe at least 30% of the decays, the resolution \( \delta \) must be such that the probability of detecting a decay is at least 30%. The probability of a decay occurring within a distance \( \delta \) is approximately:

\[
P = \frac{\delta}{L}
\]

Setting \( P = 0.3 \):

\[
\delta = 0.3 \cdot L
\]

Substitute \( L \approx 1.90 \, \mu\text{m} \):

\[
\delta = 0.3 \cdot 1.90 \, \mu\text{m} \approx 0.57 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

However, the options provided do not include this value. Instead, the closest option to the calculated decay length \( L \) is:

\[
\delta \approx 2.08 \, \mu\text{m}
\]

This suggests that the problem may be asking for the minimum resolution corresponding to the mean decay length rather than the 30% threshold.

### Final Answer
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is approximately \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \), which matches option A.
