Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question asks which exoplanet has the highest density among the four options. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to the letters a to d.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. But wait, the volume of a planet depends on its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if a planet has a larger radius, its volume increases quite a bit.

Looking at each option:

Option a: Earth mass and Earth radius. So, same as our planet. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density ~5.5 g/cm³. Wait, if the density is given, why are we even considering? Oh, maybe the question is asking if this option's density is the same as Earth, but their mass is higher. But the question is about which has the highest density. So option b has a density of 5.5. So, same as Earth. So same as option a.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. Same composition would mean same density, right? Because density is mass/volume, and if composition is same, then for the same size, but wait, if it's more massive, unless the radius scales in a certain way.

Wait, wait.
