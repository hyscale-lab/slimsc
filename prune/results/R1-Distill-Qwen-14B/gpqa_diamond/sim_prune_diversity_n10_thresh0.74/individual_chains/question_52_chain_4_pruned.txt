Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. The key points are about the star's effective temperature change and how that affects the population of these energy levels.

First, let's parse the question. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the star's temperature decreases because of the spots. 

The problem then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. This ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when spots are present, it's lower. We're to find the ratio of the original ratio (no spots) to the spot ratio.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. And we can assume Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the usual Boltzmann equation applies for population ratios.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: 

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where n is the number of atoms in each level, g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, we're considering the ratio when the star isn't spotted and when it is. So, we can write the ratio for both cases and find their ratio.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature drops. So the temperature T is lower when spots are present. The question is about the same transition in the same star, so maybe the energy difference E2 - E1 stays the same.

Let me denote the ratio as R = n2/n1.

When no spots: R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

When spots: R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

We need to find the factor by which R1 changes compared to R2, which would be R1 / R2.

So, the factor is (R1)/(R2) = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

The g factors cancel out, so it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Wait, let me make sure: 

Original numerator is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), denominator is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). So when you divide, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, no, let me re-calculate:

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) + (ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which factors out to exp( (ΔE/k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

So, ΔE is E2 - E1, but when you take the ratio, it's (E
