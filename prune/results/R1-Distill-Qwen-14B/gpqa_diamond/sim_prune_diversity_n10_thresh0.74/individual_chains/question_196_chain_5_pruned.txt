Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm. Let me see. I remember harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement, like a mass on a spring. But this one is relativistic, which probably means we have to consider special relativity effects, like how speeds approach the speed of light.

The problem gives me that the oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving c, k, A, m.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So in that case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so maybe that's not the right approach anymore.

In relativity, energy isn't just kinetic; you have to consider total energy which includes rest mass energy. The energy of a relativistic oscillator would involve relativistic expressions for kinetic energy. So the total mechanical energy E would be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. So at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the oscillator's velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At equilibrium position, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let me think. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, the oscillator's velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kx². At x = A, potential energy is (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at
