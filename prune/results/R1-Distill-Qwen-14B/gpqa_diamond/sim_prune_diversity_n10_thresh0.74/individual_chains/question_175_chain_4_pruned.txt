Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the form of f.

Wait, right. I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution and the polarization. Since this is spheroidal and symmetric along z, maybe it's like a dipole? Oh wait, a dipole would have a particular radiation pattern.

Dipole radiation... right. The power radiated by a dipole varies with the angle theta. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis) and has minima at theta = 0 and 180 degrees. So the power depends on sin(theta) or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, for a dipole, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (sin^2(theta))/(1 + cos^2(theta))^2, or something like that. Or maybe it's (sin^2(theta)) times some function. Alternatively, I think the radiated power pattern for a dipole has a maximum at 90 degrees. Let me try to recall.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with the dipole radiation pattern. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta) in the far field. Wait, no, that's the radiation pattern for an electric dipole. I think the formula is something like (sin^2 theta) times a factor, and the maximum is at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta). So when theta is 90 degrees, sin(theta) is 1, so that's the maximum. So at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so the intensity would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times the maximum.

Wait, but wait. The maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees, so the fraction at theta=30 would be (sin^2 30) / (sin^2 90) times the maximum. So sin 30 is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. The maximum is 1, so the fraction is 25% of A.

So the fraction would be 1/4. Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A) 1/2, lambda^-4

B) 1/4, lambda^-3

C) 1/4, lambda^-4

D) 3/4, lambda^-6

Hmm, so the fraction is 1/4, so possible options are B and C.

Now, what about the form of the function f, which is the radiated power per unit solid angle. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration perhaps, but in the far field, the intensity is proportional to 1/lambda^4. Because the radiated power depends on the square of the frequency (since power is like E^2, and E for EM waves is ~ c*acceleration / r), and frequency is c/lambda, so (1/lambda^2) squared gives 1/lambda^4.

Wait, another thought: the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to (omega^4) * (charge^2) etc., but in terms of lambda, since lambda = 2pi c / omega, omega is proportional to 1/lambda. So omega^4 is (1/lambda)^4, hence f would be proportional to 1/lambda^
