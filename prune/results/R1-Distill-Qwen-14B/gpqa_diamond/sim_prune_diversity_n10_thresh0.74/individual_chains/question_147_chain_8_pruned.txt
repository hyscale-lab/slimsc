Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. Hmm, annihilation usually involves particles and their antiparticles annihilating each other and producing other particles. Right.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So one proton and one antiproton are annihilating to produce two A+ and two A- particles. I think A must be some kind of meson or something similar, but maybe the specifics don't matter here.

The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, does that mean it's moving at a low velocity, like non-relativistic? Because if it's moving slowly, its kinetic energy might be much less than its rest energy. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the problem yet.

We're given m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the rest mass energy of particle A is 300 MeV. And the question is asking for the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the velocity of A, but each A comes from the annihilation. So I'm thinking about conservation of energy and momentum here. Because in any reaction, energy and momentum must be conserved.

Let's jot down the given data:

- Reaction: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻
- m_A c² =
