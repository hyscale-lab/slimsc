Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty of an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). But wait, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, then the expectation values of P_x might be straightforward, but P_z is different.

Wait, no. The state is in the basis of P_z. Because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the given state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because in that basis, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, no, wait. The state is given as a column vector in the P_z basis. So the components directly correspond to the expansion coefficients in terms of P_z eigenstates.

But the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not of P_z. So the state is a superposition of P_z eigenstates.

So to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, I just need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. But wait, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the state corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, let me think again.

The state is |ψ> = ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 )^T. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. Let me denote the eigenstates as |n>, where n=1,2,3. So |ψ> = a1 |1> + a2 |2> + a3 |3>, where a1 is -1/2, a2 is 1/√2, a3 is -1/2.

Each |n> has eigenvalues P_z |n> = p_n |n>, where p_n is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Looking at the matrix of P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ [ℏ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ℏ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The problem says the matrix of P_z has rows:

First row: (ℏ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ℏ)

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ. Because the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues when the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis. Oh, so the basis is arranged such that the first basis vector is the eigenstate with eigenvalue ℏ, the second with 0, and the third with -ℏ.

So the state |ψ> is a combination of these. So |ψ> = a1 |1> + a2 |2> + a3 |3> where |1> has eigenvalue ℏ, |2> has 0, |3> has -ℏ.

So, expectation value of P_z is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis, P_z acts diagonally. So:

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = |a1|² * ℏ + |a2|² * 0 + |a3|² * (-ℏ)

Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ = |a1|² * ℏ² + |a2|² * 0 + |a3|² * ℏ²

Because (P_z)^2 will have eigenvalues (ℏ)^2, 0, (ℏ)^2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the coefficients. The state is:

a1 = -1/2

a2 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071

a3 = -1/2

So the probabilities (squared magnitudes) are:

|a1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

|a2|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2

|a3|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ℏ = 0.

And ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)*(ℏ^2) + (1/2)*(0) + (1/4)*(ℏ^2) = (1/4 + 1/4)ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2)ℏ² - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) * ℏ. Which is ℏ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with expectation values, especially in eigenstates, the calculation could be more straightforward.

Alternatively, since the state is a superposition, another approach is to compute the expectation value directly using matrix multiplication.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩: ψ† P_z ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal, this is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding |amplitudes|².

Which is the same as what I did earlier.

So yes, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, and ⟨P_z²⟩ is ( ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ℏ^2 + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ℏ^2 ) ?

Wait, no, because the diagonal entries of P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So when you compute ψ† P_z ψ, it's:

( (-1/2)^2 ) * ℏ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ℏ) )

Which is (1/4)ℏ + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ℏ) ) = 0.

And ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum of |a_i|^2 * (eigenvalues of P_z squared).

So the eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. Squared, they're ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

So, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ℏ² ) - 0 ) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Looking back at the options:

Option B is ℏ/sqrt(2).

So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the given state vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state $|\psi\rangle$ is a linear combination of these eigenstates, with coefficients $a_1 = -1/2$, $a_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $a_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities (squared magnitudes of the coefficients) are:

\[
|a_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |a_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |a_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |a_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |a_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |a_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |a_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
