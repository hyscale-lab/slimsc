Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. If a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to check each for the possibility of optical isomerism. Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at one carbon, right? So each phenyl group is attached to the central carbon. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 and 6' and the other substituents are the carboxylate esters (methyl groups). Wait, so the central carbon is connected to two nitro groups, two methyl esters, and the two phenyl rings? No, wait. Biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the structure is like Ph-Ph, but each has substituents. For the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings), the substituents are two nitro groups (on each ring?), or wait, no. The numbering is 6 and 6'â€”so each ring has a nitro at position 6. Then the 2 and 2' positions have the dicarboxylate esters. So the central carbon is attached to two nitro groups (from each ring?), two ester groups, and two benzene rings? Wait, each ring's substituents are at 6 and 2. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (each ring) and what else? Each phenyl has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Wait, maybe the central
