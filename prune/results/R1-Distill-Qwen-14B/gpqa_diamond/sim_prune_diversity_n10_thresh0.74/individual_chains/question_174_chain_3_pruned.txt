Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The more massive fragment is twice as heavy as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about finding the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical, non-relativistic approximation.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear fission, the total energy should be conserved, including both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass: M, rest energy E_rest_initial = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: mass 2m and m (since one is twice as massive as the other).
- Sum of rest masses: 2m + m = 3m = 0.99 M. So M = 3m / 0.99 ≈ (3/0.99) m ≈ 3.0303 m. Hmm, but maybe I should keep it as 3m = 0.99 M for now.

Wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² = 300 GeV. Then the rest mass energy of the fragments is 2m c² + m c² = 3m c². But according to the problem, this sum is 99% of the initial mass's rest energy. So 3m c² = 0.99 * M c². Which makes sense because 3m = 0.99 M.

So 3m c² = 0.99 * (M c²) → 3m c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV → 3m c² = 297 GeV. So the rest mass energies of the two fragments are 198 GeV (2m) and 99 GeV (m), since 2m is twice the mass of m.

Now, when the nucleus splits, some mass is converted into kinetic energy. The total energy after fission is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total energy before was just 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is (3m c²) + (K1 + K2), where K1 and K2 are the kinetic energies of the two fragments.

So, 300 GeV = 3m c² + K1 + K2. Plugging in 3m c² as 297 GeV, we get:

300 = 297 + K1 + K2 → K1 + K2 = 3
