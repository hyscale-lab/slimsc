Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice via oral gavage. When they did in vivo imaging, some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They found the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Hmm. So I need to figure out which process is happening here.

First, I should recall what each part of the experiment entails. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? Peyer's patches are regions in the small intestine's mucosal lining that are part of the immune system, specifically the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're important for immune responses to pathogens entering through the digestive tract.

The GFP is used to track the rotavirus proteins. But some were destroyed by stomach acidâ€”probably because the stomach has a low pH which denatures proteins. So not all of the GFP-tagged proteins would survive the stomach. The others got stuck in the mucus, which makes sense because mucus can trap things, preventing them from moving further. But eventually, some must have reached the Peyer's patches.

Peyer's patches are where immune cells like dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells are present. When the rotavirus proteins (antigens) reach there, they would be taken up by these antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The APCs then present the antigens on their surface using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which then activate helper T cells. B cells, activated by these helper T cells, would start proliferating and differentiating into plasma cells and memory B cells.

Now, the question says that they isolated the proliferating cell population and looked at the variable heavy chain genes. High variability suggests that each cell's gene is different, which is typical when the immune system is generating diverse antibodies.

So what processes lead to variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains? I remember that during the immune response, especially in B cells, there are a few key processes: VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation, and class switching recombination.

VDJ recombination happens during the generation of B cell receptors in the bone marrow. It's the process where V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments are combined in different ways to create a vast array of possible antigen-binding sites. This happens during B cell development before they encounter an antigen.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell has been activated. It's a process where mutations are introduced into the variable region of the B cell receptor during the germinal center reaction. This process increases the diversity of the antibodies produced, allowing for more precise targeting of pathogens.

Class switching recombination (or isotype switching) changes the class of antibody produced (like from IgM to IgG or IgA). This doesn't affect the variable regions' diversity directly but changes the overall structure of the antibody.

In the question, the cells are proliferating, which suggests they are activated B cells undergoing division in a germinal center. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is most likely due to somatic hypermutation. Because each B cell has undergone different mutations, leading to different sequences in their variable regions.

Wait, but wait. VDJ recombination is during the initial formation, so if the cells were just naive, their variable regions would be set. But these cells are proliferating, which suggests they're activated and have undergone some process after antigen recognition. So it's more about somatic hypermutation.

So the process taking place would be somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer's patches. These patches, located in the small intestine, are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and play a key role in immune responses to pathogens entering through the digestive tract. The GFP-tagged proteins are likely taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the Peyer's patches, activating B cells and leading to proliferation.

The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population suggests a process that generates diversity in the immune response. VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, this process occurs before antigen exposure and does not explain the variability observed in this experiment.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, introduces mutations into the variable region of the B cell receptor during the germinal center reaction, increasing the diversity of antibodies produced. This process aligns with the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes and the proliferation of B cells in response to the rotavirus antigen.

Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) but does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions. Therefore, the process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
