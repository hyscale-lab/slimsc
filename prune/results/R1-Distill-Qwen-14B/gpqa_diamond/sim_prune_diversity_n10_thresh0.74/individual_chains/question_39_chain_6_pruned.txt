Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in a wave function. So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but I remember that wave functions in quantum mechanics are supposed to be normalized. Oh right, the normalization condition says that the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. So I need to normalize this wave function between x=1 and x=3 because the particles are only found there.

Wait, I should note that the wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that seems a bit odd. Because usually, wave functions are complex, but the real and imaginary parts are functions of x, not constants. Oh wait, maybe I misread it. Let me look again. Oh, no, the function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Oh, interesting. So ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but that's a bit strange because the imaginary part is a constant, not a function of x. But okay, perhaps that's the case. So when we calculate the normalization, we'll have to integrate the absolute square of ψ.

The absolute square is ψ*(x) ψ(x). So ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate, which would be [a/sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i. Multiplying that by ψ(x) gives [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) [from the cross terms]. Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, when you multiply (a + ib)(a - ib), you get a² + b². But in this case, ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i. So ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (-0.5)i, which is (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ* times ψ, it's [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5i
