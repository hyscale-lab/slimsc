Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I think that means they're the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles, right?

The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait. So that's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2, which has two states. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because for i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, and for i=j, it's 0. So this operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Wait, actually, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but here the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2 instead of 1. So this operator is actually (ħ/2) * σ_x. Because σ_x has those 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because the operator is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. Let me think about the eigenstates of σ_x. Oh, right, they are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. These states can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, I remember that:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring the system in these states.

But wait, the state |alpha> is given as proportional, so first I should normalize it. Let's calculate the normalization factor. |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Calculating each term: |1+i|² is (1² +1²)=2, and |2 -i|² is (2² + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7).

So the state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the system in |+x> and |-x>. Alternatively, since these are the eigenstates of operator A, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the amplitudes when |alpha> is expressed in the basis of |+x> and |-x>.

So, let's write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let me express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>, we get:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me combine the terms:

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> + ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) |-x> ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))

Simplify numerator:

(1+i + 2 -i) = 3, because 1+2 is 3 and i -i cancels.

( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

|alpha> = [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14), so denominator is sqrt(14).

So,

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1
