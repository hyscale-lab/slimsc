Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about stars with spots and how they affect brightness variations, and I need to compare it to an exoplanet's effect. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. Its effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness changes. And this looks like an exoplanet transit, but the question is asking what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change as the spots.

Wait, so if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve? Oh right, the amplitude here refers to the change in brightness when something passes in front of the star. For an exoplanet, it's the transit method where the planet blocks some light, causing a dip. For the star with spots, the spots are darker, so when they face us, the star's brightness decreases.

But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they're on the side facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. So the variation would be similar to a planet blocking part of the star, but maybe the calculation is a bit different because the spots are spread out and not a single point.

Wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet. So we need to find the planet radius that would cause the same change in brightness as the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if the planet's radius is Rp, the star's is Rstar, then the fractional brightness change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But wait, the spots are a bit different. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, but each spot is cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the total brightness dip. Wait, but the way the brightness changes is a bit more involved because it's not a single transit but a modulation over time as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's say Rstar is R_sun. The hemisphere is covered 20% by spots. So the area covered by spots on one hemisphere is 0.2 times the area of that hemisphere.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the spots cover (0.4πR²)/(4πR²) = 0.4/4 = 0.1 or 10% of the entire star's surface. Oh wait, no, because the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a 20% filling factor. So 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The entire star is 4πR², so the spots cover 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's brightness when the spots are on the side facing us would be lower. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, causing a dip. But the spots are cooler, so the flux from them is less than the surrounding areas.

Wait, so the brightness variation would involve the change in flux as the spots rotate into and out of view. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible. But wait, the star is rotating, so the spots are on a hemisphere, so as the star rotates, the spots come into view over time.

But for the purpose of comparing to an exoplanet, perhaps we can model the maximum dip caused by the spots as the same as the dip caused by a planet blocking a certain area.

Wait, but how does the temperature difference affect this? Oh, because the spots are cooler, their contribution to the star's total flux is less. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the total flux from the star is less than when the spots are on the other side.

So the star's brightness without spots would be based on the entire surface at 6000 K. The spots are at 5000 K (since Teff is 6000, spots are 1000 K cooler). So when a spot is facing us, it contributes less flux.

Wait, so the change in brightness depends on the difference in flux from the spots versus the rest of the star. Let me think.

The total flux from the star when a spot is facing us is the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the non-spotted area. Without spots, the flux is uniform. But with spots, when a spot is in view, the flux from that region is lower.

So the fractional change in flux when a spot is viewed is (Flux without spot - Flux with spot) / Flux without spot.

Wait, but each spot's area is a fraction of the star's disk. Let's model each spot as a small area with a lower temperature. But given that the spots are spread over a hemisphere with a 20% filling factor, perhaps we can model the overall effect as an average.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the dip caused by the spots as equivalent to a planet blocking a certain area. So the dip caused by the spots would be proportional to the area of the spots visible, multiplied by the difference in brightness per unit area.

Wait, the planet blocks some area, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. The spots, on the other hand, cause a dip because the spots are darker. So for each spot, the dip is (A_spot / A_star) * (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal.

Where A_spot is the area of the spot, A_star is the area of the star, F_normal is the flux per unit area when the spot isn't there, and F_spot is the flux when the spot is present.

So the total dip due to all spots is the sum over all spots of (A_spot / A_star) * (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal.

But wait, when the star is rotating, all the spots on one hemisphere come into view over time, but in the case of the planet, the planet blocks part of the star, which is a single event. So perhaps the maximum dip of the star due to the spots would be the combined effect of all the spots on that hemisphere.

Wait, but since the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, modulating the brightness over time. However, the question is about the amplitude of the variation, which is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, no, the problem states that the star's brightness variation due to spots can closely resemble that of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to that caused by the planet. Hence, we can model the dip due to the spots as similar to a planet transit.

So let me think, when a spot is visible, it reduces the flux. The maximum dip would be when the entire hemisphere's worth of spots is facing us. Wait, no, the star is a sphere. If the star is rotating and the spots are on one hemisphere, the maximum number of spots visible at any time would be when the center of that hemisphere is facing us. So the area of the spots visible would be 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But when the star is viewed from the side, we'd see a circle of radius R, so the area is πR². So the area of the spots visible is 0.4πR², but the area of the star's disk we see is πR². Wait, no, because the hemisphere is the surface area on the star. Wait, when the star rotates, the hemisphere is either facing us or not. Wait, no, the star is a sphere. When the hemisphere with the spots is facing us, the entire hemisphere is visible. But the hemisphere is half the star's surface. Wait, no, the hemisphere is half of the sphere. So when the star is viewed such that this hemisphere is facing us, we can see the entire hemisphere, which is 2πR² area.

So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the area of the spots is 0.4πR², and the area of the star's disk is πR² (since the star's radius is R, and the area we see is πR²).

Wait, no, the star's radius is R, so the area is 4πR² (as the surface area of a sphere). So when a hemisphere is facing us, we see half of the star's surface, which is 2πR². So of that, 20% is covered by spots. So the spots visible area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So when the star is in this orientation, the area of the spots visible is 0.4πR².

Wait, but the area of the star we're seeing is 2πR², so the area of the spots is 0.4πR². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4πR²)/(2πR²) = 0.2, so 20%.

But each spot's contribution to the overall flux is (F_spot - F_normal)/F_normal.

Flux per unit area is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So F_normal is sigma * (6000)^4, F_spot is sigma * (5000)^4.

So the fractional change per spot area is (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal = 1 - (5000/6000)^4.

Calculating that: (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 = ~0.6944, squared again is ~0.4823. So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Wait, that's approximately 51.77% decrease per spot area.

So the total fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is (Area_spots_visible / Area_visible) * (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal.

Which is (0.4πR² / 2πR²) * 0.5177.

Simplify: (0.4 / 2) * 0.5177 = 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035, or about 10.35% dip.

Wait, so the amplitude of the brightness variation is 10.35% when the spots are fully visible.

But wait, the question says that the star's brightness variation amplitude is the same as that of an exoplanet causing the same dip. So what is the planet's radius that would cause a 10.35% dip?

The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, wait, no. Because when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. The dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but only if the entire planet is in front of the star and the star's brightness is uniform. So if the star has spots, but we're comparing to a planet that doesn't—assuming the star's brightness is uniform (without spots), then the dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in our case, the star has spots, so the dip is approximately 10.35% as we calculated. So to get the same dip, the planet would have to cause a dip of 10.35%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Hence, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316. Wait, because sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. Hmm, but let's calculate it more accurately.

0.1035, so square root. Let me compute it:

0.32^2 = 0.1024,

0.32^2 = 0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024.

0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is very close to 0.1035. So sqrt(0.1035) is approximately 0.322.

So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.322, which is about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but the options provided are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So D is the closest.

Wait, but did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check.

Wait, the area of the spots visible is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The visible area is 2πR², so the fraction is 0.4πR² / 2πR² = 0.2.

The flux change per spot is (F_normal - F_spot)/F_normal = (6000^4 -5000^4)/(6000^4).

Calculating that:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12.

So the difference is 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

Divide by 1296e12: 671 / 1296 ≈ 0.5177, as I had before. So the factor is about 51.77% decrease per unit area.

So the total dip is 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035, so 10.35% dip.

So the planet's dip must be 10.35%, which requires (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322, which is about 0.32.

So option D is correct.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \) (\( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The spots cause a dip in brightness when they are visible. The fractional change in flux is proportional to the area of the spots and the temperature difference.
   - The total surface area of the star is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the visible area when one hemisphere is facing us is \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere, so the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - The fraction of the visible area covered by spots is \( \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2} = 0.2 \) (20%).

3. **Flux Change**:
   - The flux from a unit area of the star is proportional to \( T^4 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{normal}}}{F_{\text{spot}}} = \left(\frac{6000}{5000}\right)^4 \approx 1.907.
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux per unit area of a spot is:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{normal}} - F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 1 - \frac{1}{1.907} \approx 0.5177.
     \]
   - The total fractional change in brightness when the spots are fully visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.1035 \, (10.35\%).
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Comparison**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the radius ratio:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \Delta F.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This matches option **D**.
