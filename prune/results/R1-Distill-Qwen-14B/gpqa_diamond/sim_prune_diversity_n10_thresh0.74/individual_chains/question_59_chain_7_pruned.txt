Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me see... The problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a bit of a mix of acids and a base. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I should figure out how many moles of each acid and base we're dealing with. Moles are calculated by concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). But wait, the volumes are given in milliliters, so I need to convert those to liters by dividing by 1000.

Let's start with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid. So the moles would be 0.1 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L). Let me calculate that: 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Got it.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid. So, moles would be 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Right, because 400 mL is 0.4 L. So 0.2 times 0.4 is 0.08.

Now Ba(OH)2. Oh, that's barium hydroxide, a strong base. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. The formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻. So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH⁻. So the moles here would be 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives two OH- ions, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The problem is mixing an acid and a base. So I should probably find out if the moles of H+ from the acids are more than the OH- from the base, or vice versa. Because depending on the excess, the solution will be acidic or basic. And if it's neutral, then pH would be 7, but that's unlikely here.

So let's think about it. The total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Hmm, but in the presence of a strong acid like HCl, maybe the weak acid doesn't contribute much since HCl is a strong acid. Or is it? Wait, when you mix them, the H+ from HCl will dissociate completely, and the CH3COOH will also contribute some H+. But maybe the HCl's H+ will dominate, so perhaps I can consider the excess H+ or OH- after neutralization.

Wait, another approach: when you mix an acid and a base, they react. So, the H+ from all acids will react with
