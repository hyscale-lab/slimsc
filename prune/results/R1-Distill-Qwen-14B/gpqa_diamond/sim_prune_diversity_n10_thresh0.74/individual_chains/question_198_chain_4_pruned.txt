Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex... I remember that the dithiocyanato complex is probably the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ form. But first, I should figure out what each β represents. Stability constants (formation constants) are given for each complex step. So, β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)₂, β3 for Co(SCN)₃, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄? Or wait, sometimes the numbering is a bit different. Oh right, the stability constants are for each successive addition of SCN- to the metal ion.

So the complexes would be:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²+ (β1)

CoSCN²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂^0 (β2)

Co(SCN)_2^0 + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_3^- (β3)

Co(SCN)_3^- + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)_4^2- (β4) 

Wait, I'm not sure about the charges here. But for the sake of the problem, I think the exact charge might not matter because we're dealing with ratios.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 species. So that's the second complex, where n=2. So I need to find the fraction of all Co species that is this [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex.

To find this, I think I should use the concept of the distribution of metal complexes based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand. The general approach would involve calculating the fraction of each complex using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The formula I remember is that the fraction of each complex is given by the product of the stability constants up to that complex, multiplied by [SCN]^n, divided by the sum over all possible complexes of similar terms.

So, the general expression for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (sum over m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN]^m) )

Wait, but wait, what about the initial term when m=0? Because for m=0, it's just Co²+ with no ligands. So β0 would be 1, I suppose.

So for each complex, the numerator is the product of β1 to βn
