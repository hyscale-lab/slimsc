Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let me try to think this through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. It's oscillating, so it must radiate electromagnetic waves. The wavelength is λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also determine the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that when a dipole radiates, the radiation pattern is not isotropic. For a dipole antenna, the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole (so θ=90 degrees, I think). The intensity or power per unit solid angle depends on the angle θ.

Oh right! The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula I(θ) proportional to (sinθ)^2 or something similar. Wait, the exact expression I recall is that the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but that's for a different type of radiation—wait, no, that's for the dipole's radiation. Let me think again.

Oh, wait. The power radiated by a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) depends on the angle θ. The formula I think is that the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Or wait, maybe it's that the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but the power per unit solid angle is actually proportional to sin²θ. Because solid angle is 2π sinθ dθ, so the function f(θ) would be the intensity per steradian. Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle (which is the intensity) would be proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum would be when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees, but the question is about θ=30 degrees.

Wait, but the function f is given as a function of λ and θ, and the maximum power is A. So f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle. The total power A would be the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles, right?

Wait, no. The maximum power is A, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum value of f is A, perhaps? Or wait, no. Because when you integrate f over all solid angles, you get the total power radiated. So if the maximum value of f is A, that would mean that at some angle θ, f(θ) is A, and elsewhere it's lower.

But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So the maximum value of the function f is A, but wait, no. Because f is the power per unit solid angle. So integrating f over all solid angles gives the total power. The maximum value of f would be the maximum power per unit solid angle, which could be larger than the total power? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the total power is the integral of f over the entire sphere.

Wait, perhaps maximum power refers to the maximum value of f. Let me think. For a dipole, the radiation has a donut-shaped pattern around the z-axis. The intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees (equator), and zero at the poles (θ=0 and 180). So the function f would have its maximum at θ=90 degrees. The maximum value of f would be at that point.

So, for a dipole, the radiation is such that the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to sin²θ. But wait, wait, the intensity is actually (sinθ)^2 times some constants. So the power per unit solid angle, which is intensity multiplied by the area per solid angle, wait, no. Wait, power per unit solid angle is the intensity (in W/m²) multiplied by the area per solid angle? I'm getting a
