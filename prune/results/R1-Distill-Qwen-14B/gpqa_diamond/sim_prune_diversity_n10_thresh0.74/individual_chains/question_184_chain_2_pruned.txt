Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. Hmm, let me think about the structure of the target molecule. 

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me sketch the structure. Position 1: ethoxy group (-OEt). Position 2: tert-butyl group. Position 3: nitro group (-NO2). So, the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, but they can't all be meta to each other. Oh wait, benzene's substituents can be in ortho, meta, or para positions relative to each other. 

Wait, actually, in this molecule, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row. So, ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, the numbering could be different, but the relative positions are crucial.

When building such a molecule, the order of substituent addition is important because each substitution can direct the next. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, and the substituents added will direct incoming groups to specific positions.

So, I need to plan the
