Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem gives me the matrix forms of the operators Px, Py, and Pz. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which probably means that the states are in the z-basis. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of Pz in this state.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula:
ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²)

So I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

Wait, but since the state is given as a vector, maybe I can compute these expectation values directly using the matrix form of Pz and the state vector.

Let me write down the given state ψ as a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

The matrix Pz is given as:
Pz = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So to find ⟨Pz⟩, I compute ψ† Pz ψ.

Let me break that down. The conjugate transpose of ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] since all components are real here, I think. Wait, the operator Pz has real components, so no need to worry about complex conjugation?

So ψ† Pz would be the row vector [ (-1/2)*Pz[0][0], (1/√2)*Pz[1][1], (-1/2)*Pz[2][2] ] plus the other terms from multiplication? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe compute the matrix product Pz ψ first, then take the dot product with ψ.

So let's compute Pz ψ. Pz is a diagonal matrix, so applying it to ψ is straightforward. Each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So Pz ψ would be:
First component: (ħ)(-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2

So Pz ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is ψ† (Pz ψ).

ψ is [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2], so the dot product is:
(-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2
