Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about an electron traveling along the x-direction at a speed v, and we know the uncertainty in its position, Δx. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, right? But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

But wait, the electron's momentum is related to its velocity. Oh right, momentum p is mass times velocity, m*v. But since we have an uncertainty in position, the momentum is uncertain as well. So Δp would be... I think it's the uncertainty in momentum, which is related to the change in velocity, but wait, no, Δp is the uncertainty in the momentum, so maybe we can express Δp as m*Δv or m*v times something? Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the momentum spread due to the position uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the uncertainty principle for energy and time. Wait, but the question is about the uncertainty in energy, so perhaps I should use the relation between energy and momentum.

Wait, energy for a particle is given by E = p²/(2m), where p is momentum. So if we have an uncertainty in p, that would translate into an uncertainty in E. Let's see.

First, let's get the given values:

Δx = 0.1 nm. Oh, nanometers. Let's convert that to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters.

The speed v is 2e8 m/s. But wait, that's 2*10^8 m/s. Wait, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so this is about two-thirds the speed of light. Does that matter? Well, since the speed is a significant fraction of c, relativistic effects might come into play. But wait, the problem says to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy. Hmm, but maybe for the purposes of this problem, they're assuming non-relativistic speeds? Or perhaps the calculation can be made using classical formulas.

Wait, but electrons have rest mass around 9.1e-31 kg. Let me think about it.

So, using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So, Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Because Δx is given, and we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, so we can take Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

What's ħ? Planck's constant h-bar is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δp = 1.0545718e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 = approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the momentum as p = m*v, but since there's an uncertainty in x, we can relate that to the uncertainty in p via the uncertainty principle.

Wait, another approach: The momentum p is m*v. But the uncertainty in momentum Δp would relate to the uncertainty in velocity Δv through Δp = m*Δv. But wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps using the uncertainty in p directly from the position uncertainty.

So, using Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let's compute that.

So, Δx is 1e-10 m. So Δp = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but when we calculate the energy uncertainty, ΔE, it would come from the uncertainty in p, because E is p squared over 2m. So ΔE would be approximately ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m). Let me think.

Because E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is the change in E due to the change in p. So using differentials, dE = (2p/(2m)) * dp, which simplifies to (p/m) dp. Wait, but maybe a better approach is to consider the uncertainty in E as (Δp)^2/(2m), since E is proportional to p squared. So ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

So plugging in the numbers:

Δp is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

So (Δp)^2 = (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49 (kg^2 m²/s²).

Divide by 2m: m is 9.1e-31 kg. So 2m is 1.82e-30 kg.

So ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30.

Let me compute that: 2.756e-49 / 1.82e-30 = approximately (2.756 / 1.82) * 1e-19.

Calculating 2.756 / 1.82: 1.82 is about 1.8, so 2.756 / 1.8 ≈ 1.53.

So 1.53e-19 J. So approximately 1.5e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s.

Then (Δp)^2 is (5.272859e-25)^2 = (5.272859)^2 * 1e-50.

5.272859 squared is about 27.8 (since 5^2=25, 5.27^2≈ 27.8).

So (5.27e-25)^2 ≈ 27.8e-50 = 2.78e-49 (kg² m^4/s²).

Divide by 2m: 2 * 9.1e-31 kg = 1.82e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.78e-49) / (1.82e-30) = (2.78 / 1.82) * 1e-19.

2.78 / 1.82 ≈ 1.527.

So ΔE ≈ 1.53e-19 J. So approximately 1.5e-19 J. The options are:

A) ~1e-18 J → 10^-18 → 1e-18 is 10 times larger.

B) ~1e-17 → way larger.

C) ~1e-19 → this is close to our result of ~1.5e-19.

D) ~1e-16 → way too big.

So the closest option is C.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider relativistic corrections. Because the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 0.667c. So, the kinetic energy might not be accurately calculated using non-relativistic formulas. However, the uncertainty principle is a quantum mechanical concept and should still hold, but the relation between energy and momentum would involve relativistic considerations. Hmm.

Wait, the energy-momentum relation in relativity is E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). But since the particle's speed is significant compared to c, but the uncertainty might be small. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic formula because the speed is high but the uncertainty is small. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think: if v is 2e8 m/s, then the kinetic energy in non-relativistic terms is (1/2 mv^2) = 0.5 * 9.1e-31 kg * (4e16 m²/s²) = 0.5 * 9.1e-31 * 4e16 = 0.5 * 3.64e-14 = 1.82e-14 J. But that's the actual energy, not the uncertainty. Wait, but the uncertainty in energy is based on the uncertainty in momentum, so perhaps the approach remains the same regardless of the frame. Because the uncertainty in momentum is small compared to the total momentum.

Wait, the total momentum p = mv = 9.1e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.82e-22 kg·m/s.

The uncertainty in p is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So the ratio is about 5.27e-25 / 1.82e-22 ≈ 0.0029. So about 0.3% of the total momentum. Since it's a small uncertainty, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is acceptable for this estimation.

So, I think the initial approach is correct, and the answer is around 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again about how the energy uncertainty is calculated. Because E = p²/(2m), the uncertainty ΔE is (Δp)^2/(2m). So that's correct.

So, yes, the minimum uncertainty in energy would be approximately 1.5e-19 J, which is closest to option C's ~1e-19 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in its position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For the minimum uncertainty, we take the equality \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), so:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The energy \( E \) of a particle is related to its momentum \( p \) by \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), where \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is then given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.78 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg}^2 \, \text{m}^4/\text{s}^2,
\]

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( \sim 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \):** Too large by a factor of 10.
- **B) \( \sim 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \):** Far too large.
- **C) \( \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):** Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) \( \sim 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \):** Far too large.

The closest option is **C**, which is consistent with the calculated result.

Answer: C
