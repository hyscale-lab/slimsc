Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think about what I need to do. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. So, the initial moles of acetic acid would be volume multiplied by concentration. Let me calculate that.

The initial volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 liters. The concentration is 0.05 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So now the acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but in the next step, we're adding NaOH. The next thing to figure out is how much NaOH is added at 25% titration. For that, I need to know the equivalence point volume. 

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = moles / concentration. 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Because 10 cm³ total × 0.25 = 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but how does adding NaOH affect the solution? Acetic acid is a weak acid; NaOH is a strong base. They'll react as: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So at 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. That means 75% of the acetic acid remains, and 25% has become its conjugate base, acetate ion.

But wait,
