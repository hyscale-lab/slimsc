Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 3 and 5 are across from each other in a meta arrangement with the ketone group in the 1 position? Or wait, maybe I should number it correctly.

Wait, when you have a substituent on the benzene, like the ketone, that's the main group, so the numbering starts from there. So, the ketone is at position 1. Then, the bromo is at position 3, and nitro at position 5. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the ring has substituents at 1,3,5 positions? No, wait, the ketone is part of the ethan-1-one, which is a substituent on the benzene. So, benzene ring with three substituents: Br at position 3, nitro at position 5, and an acetyl group (CH3CO-) at position 1.

Wait, more accurately, the molecule is (3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl) attached to ethan-1-one, which is (CH2)COCH3? No, ethan-1-one is (CH2)CO, but wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-... No, ethan-1-one is acetone, so (CH3)2CO. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Let me think: ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-CH2-. Wait no, ethan-1-one is an acetone group, so it's (CH3)2CO. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone (COCH3) attached at position 1, a bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, but when substituting benzene, directing effects matter. The substituents can be meta or para directors. So, the sequence of adding substituents will determine the positions.

So, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Which would mean that the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1. So, all three are in a meta arrangement relative to each other.

But wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which is a meta director. So, when adding substituents, their positions would depend on the order in which they are introduced.

So, let's think about
