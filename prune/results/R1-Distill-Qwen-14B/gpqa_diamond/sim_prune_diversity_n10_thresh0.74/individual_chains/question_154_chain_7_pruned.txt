Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure corresponds to the spectral data given. Let me take it step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then there's a peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, wait, molecular ion peaks usually show the molecular weight. But sometimes, isotopic peaks come into play. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance, so maybe the molecule has a Cl atom. Let me think: Chlorine-35 is about 75% abundant, and Cl-37 is about 25%. So if the molecular weight is 156, then the possible isotope would be 37Cl. Let me calculate the possible molecular weight with Cl.

Wait, if the molecular ion is at 156, and the other peak is at 158, that's a difference of 2. So, that suggests one Cl atom, because Cl has two main isotopes, 35 and 37. The molecular formula would have one Cl, right? So the molecular weight is 156. Let me think about the formula. 

Looking at the options, let's see their molecular weights.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl makes it C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C is 12*7=84, H is 5, Cl is 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So that's a problem because 156.5 is higher. Hmm, maybe it's because the molecular weight is actually 156.5, but in the options, perhaps it's rounded down? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should check each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's C7H6ClO2. Let's calculate: C=84, H=6 (6*1=6), Cl=35.5, O=32 (2 O's). So 84+6=90+35.5=125.5 +32=157.5. So molecular weight would be around 157.5, but the given molecular ion is 156. So that's higher than 156. So maybe not A.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and COOH. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: (7*12)=84, Cl=35.5, O=32, H=5. So 84 +35.5=119.5 +32=151.5 +5=156.5. So the molecular ion should be at 156.5. But the given molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, perhaps the exact mass is 156.5, but the mass spec might show a peak at 156 and 158 due to Cl isotopes. Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 is the Cl isotope. So 156 is M (Cl-35?), and 158 would be M+2 (Cl-37). Wait, but the molecular ion is the major peak, so M would be the abundance at 156. So that would fit with a Cl atom in the molecule. So option B's molecular weight is 156.5,
