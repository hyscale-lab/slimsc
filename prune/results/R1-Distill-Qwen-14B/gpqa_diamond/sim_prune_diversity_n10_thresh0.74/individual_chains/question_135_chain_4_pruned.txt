Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this.

Alright, the problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ_f f̄ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I fully get this right now. But the main point is probably about what the boson X can decay into, based on its mass and the possible interactions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, I need to find all the possible pairs of fermions that X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

I remember that for a particle to decay into two particles, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Now, let's list the possible fermion pairs. Fermions include quarks and leptons. Let's think about the masses of these particles.

For quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But wait, top quark is really heavy, like around 173 GeV. So if X is only 6 GeV, it can't decay into top quarks because each top is 173 GeV, so 2 tops would be way beyond 6 GeV. So top quark pairs are out.

What about bottom quarks? The bottom quark mass is about 4.5 GeV (I think). So if X is 6 GeV, 2 bottom quarks would be about 9 GeV. That's more than 6, so X can't decay into b b̄. Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the mass of the quark is just the rest mass. But when considering pair production, the energy required is the sum of the rest masses. So 2*4.5 is 9 GeV. Which is larger than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄. So b quarks are out.
