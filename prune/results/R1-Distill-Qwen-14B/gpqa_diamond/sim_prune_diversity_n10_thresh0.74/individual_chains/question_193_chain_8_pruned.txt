Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Then the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So parallax (plx) is 1 over distance (r) in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/r. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem states that the number of stars, let's say N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, N would be proportional to (r)^5. Wait, because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, maybe it's asking about the density or the rate of change. Let me think. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in the region increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense because as you go further away, you can't have more stars in a unit distance. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is r^5. So as r increases, the number N increases as r^5. Wait, but that would mean the density is increasing with distance? That can't be right because in reality, the density of stars decreases with distance from the galaxy's center, but this is a specific region so maybe it's about some other distribution.

Wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, wait, per unit distance. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit shell. Let me think in terms of shells. Imagine shells at a distance r with thickness dr. The volume of such a shell is 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in each shell depends on r^something, then the number per unit distance would be that something over r.

Wait, let me restate: N is proportional to r^5. So if N is the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr, then the number per unit distance would be N/(dr) = constant * r^5. But wait, that would mean the number per unit distance increases with r^5, which is option B. But I'm a bit confused because higher r would mean each shell has more stars. But that might depend on how the distribution is set up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) is dN/dr. Wait, N is proportional to r^5, so dN/dr is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) increases as r^4. So the number is proportional to r^4. Oh, that's option C.

Wait, wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance r)". So perhaps it's asking for the rate of change, the derivative. Let me re-express.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ r^5.

So dN/dr is the rate of change of number with respect to r. So dN/dr = 5 * constant * r^4, which is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because if N is proportional to r^5, then for each additional distance dr, the number of stars added is proportional to r^5 * dr. So dN = (k r^5) dr, so dN/dr = k r^5, but wait that's not right. Wait, no, N is the total number up to radius r. Or wait, no, wait. Perhaps N is the number in a shell dr thick at radius r. So N_shell ∝ r^5 * dr. Then the number per unit distance is N_shell/dr =
