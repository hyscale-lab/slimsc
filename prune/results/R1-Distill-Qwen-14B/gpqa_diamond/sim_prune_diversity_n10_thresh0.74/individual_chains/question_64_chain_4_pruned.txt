Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on. 

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight of this mixture is 7.20 grams. Then, they heated this mixture to 200°C without air. So, heating in an environment without oxygen probably means it's a closed system, maybe under inert gas or vacuum? Not sure yet.

When heated, only a mixture of gases was formed. So, the salts probably decomposed into gases. Then, these gases were passed through several tubes. Let me break down what each tube does.

First tube (№1) is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So, when gases pass through it, if there's any water vapor, it'll absorb it. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. Wait, so that means the amount of water vapor absorbed is 3.60 g. Because Mg(ClO4)2 would gain H2O, increasing the tube's weight. So, the amount of H2O in the gases is 3.60 grams.

Second tube (№2) is filled with Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is slaked lime, which is used to absorb CO2. So, if the gas mixture has CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2, producing CaCO3 and water. But in this case, the weight of the second tube didn't change. Hmm, so no CO2 was present in the gases. Or maybe the amount of CO2 was zero. So, the gas mixture doesn't contain CO2.

Third tube (№3) has red-hot copper. Cu is a metal that reacts with certain gases. I know that CO reacts with hot Cu to form CuO and CO2. So, if CO is present, it would react with Cu, producing CuO and CO2. The weight of this tube increased by 0.80 grams. Since CuO is formed, the increase in weight is due to the oxygen from CO. 

Wait, but the initial gas mixture passed through the first tube (which absorbed water) and then the second (no change, so no CO2). Then, the third tube is where CO might be reacting. Let me think about the reactions.

After the first tube, the gases would have lost any water vapor. So, the remaining gases are probably CO and maybe some other gases like N2 or O2, but I don't think so. Because the problem states that the final gas is C, which is 2.24 liters under standard conditions (STP). So, gas C is probably CO2, N2, O2, or another gas.

Wait, but the third tube involved CO reacting with Cu. Let me think: the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So, for every 2 moles of CO, we get 1 mole of CO2 and 1 mole of CuO. The mass increase in the third tube is due to the oxygen from
