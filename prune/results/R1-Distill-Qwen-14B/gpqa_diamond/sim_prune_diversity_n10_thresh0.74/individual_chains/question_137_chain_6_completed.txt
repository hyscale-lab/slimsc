Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators that use magnetic fields to guide charged particles and electric fields to accelerate them. But wait, what's the difference between them? I think synchrocyclotrons are more advanced because they can handle particles with relativistic speeds, whereas cyclotrons work better for non-relativistic ones. Right, because as particles get faster, their mass increases, so the magnetic field needs to change to keep them in the same orbit. Synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field as needed.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0, and undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with U0=190 kV and Φ0=π/4.

Wait, so the problem is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A to D, so I need to calculate this number.

Let me think about the process. The proton starts with almost no kinetic energy and is accelerated by the applied voltage. Each time it goes around the synchrocyclotron, it gains some energy. The number of revolutions would relate to how much energy it gains each time and the total energy it needs to reach.

Wait, but in cyclotrons, particles move in a circular path, and the frequency of the applied electric field must match the rotation frequency of the particles as they spiral out. Oh right, because the particles gain energy each time they pass through the electric field. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, which varies the magnetic field, the cyclotron frequency changes as the proton's speed increases.

Wait, but the question gives the voltage as a function of time. Hmm, the voltage is alternating, so it's AC. The form is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. So the angular frequency is 2πν(α). But since it's a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν depends on the particle's momentum, which changes as it's accelerated.

Wait, but the proton is undergoing two accelerations? Or is it two steps? Wait, the question says "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator", but that's probably a translation issue. Maybe it's saying that the proton is accelerated twice, which might imply it goes around the ring twice. But that doesn't seem right because the answer options are in thousands.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied in a way that each cycle of the voltage corresponds to one revolution. Or maybe each time the proton completes a revolution, it's accelerated by the voltage. So the number of revolutions would be linked to the number of times the voltage goes through a cycle.

Wait, but the proton's velocity is increasing, so the time it takes for each revolution is changing. Because the cyclotron frequency depends on the mass and the magnetic field. But since the synchrocyclotron adjusts the magnetic field to keep the radius of the orbit proportional to the momentum, the frequency might stay roughly the same? Or does it change?

Wait, in a cyclotron, the frequency is determined by (qB)/(2m), which is fixed if B is fixed. So as the velocity increases, the radius increases, but the time for a revolution remains the same. Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied to keep the frequency matched. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but the question's setup might not require me to get into the detailed dynamics. Let me think about the energy gained.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and ends up at 950 MeV. So the total energy gained is 950 MeV. If each revolution gives a certain amount of energy, the number of revolutions would be the total energy divided by the energy per revolution.

But wait, the energy per revolution in an accelerator using a voltage U is typically q*U. Because each time the proton passes through the voltage, it gains energy equal to qU. But wait, in a cyclotron, the voltage is applied alternately in each of the two gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. Each time the proton goes around, it passes through each electrode once, so each revolution gives the proton 2qU. Or wait, maybe the voltage is applied across the gap, so each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains qU. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in a typical cyclotron, the potential difference is applied between the two gaps. The proton, moving in a circular path, alternately passes through regions of opposite potentials. So each half-revolution, it gains energy. So each full revolution, it gains 2qU. Because when it's at the first gap, it's accelerated, then on the other side, it's decelerated because the potential is opposite, but since it's moving, the next gap is the same as the first when it comes around. Hmm, maybe each full revolution gives it twice the potential energy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to approach this differently.

The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos(2πνt + Φ0). So the frequency of the voltage is ν. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν must match the proton's rotation frequency. Because when the proton completes a half-revolution, the voltage has changed phase, so that the next acceleration happens at the correct point in the cycle.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is adjusted as the proton's velocity changes to keep them in sync.

But perhaps for this problem, I can ignore the specifics of how the frequency ν(α) changes because it's not given. Hmm, but the question gives U(t) as a function of time, but does that help me directly?

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh wait, maybe that's a different aspect. So perhaps each time the proton goes through the electric field, it's accelerated. So each revolution might involve two acceleration steps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number of revolutions is given by how many times the proton can be accelerated by the voltage to reach the desired energy.

Wait, the energy gained per revolution might be equal to the voltage times the charge of the proton. Let me see: the kinetic energy gained would be equal to the work done on the proton by the electric field. Each time the proton passes through the electric field (each gap), it gains energy equal to qU, where U is the voltage. Wait, but in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the gaps, and the proton alternates between the two gaps, so each time it goes through one gap, it gains qU. So each full revolution would involve two such accelerations, so each revolution gives a total of 2qU.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The cyclotron has two D-shaped electrodes. The electric field alternates direction each half-cycle. So as the proton moves from one D to the other, the potential is such that it gains energy qU. Then, when it comes back, the other D is at a different potential so it can gain another qU. So each full revolution, the proton gains 2qU in energy. But wait, no, because when the proton moves into the first gap, it gains energy. Then when it moves into the second gap, which is the same as the first after a half-revolution, it gains another energy. So each full revolution, it gains twice the voltage times the charge.

Wait, but that would imply that each revolution gives a gain of 2eU, since for a proton, e is its charge. So if U is the peak voltage, U0, then each revolution would give 2eU0 energy.

But wait, the voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos(...). So the maximum voltage is U0. So the maximum energy gain per acceleration step is eU0. Wait, but in each revolution, how many times does the proton go through the accelerating gaps? Once per revolution? Or twice?

Wait, perhaps each revolution provides two energy gains. Because in a cyclotron, each time the proton passes through a gap, it's accelerated once. Since there are two gaps, each revolution would have two accelerations. So each revolution gives 2eU0 of energy. But wait, no, because the electric field alternates direction every half-period, so the potential difference alternates. So each time the proton passes a gap, it gains eU0. Then, when it goes through the other gap on the next half-circle, it gains another eU0. So each full revolution adds 2eU0 to the energy.

But wait, in reality, the voltage is applied with a certain frequency, and the cyclotron is designed so that the proton is accelerated once per revolution, but I might be getting this mixed up. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton has made one revolution. Let's think in terms of energy.

The total energy needed is 950 MeV. The energy per revolution is e multiplied by the voltage times some factor.

Wait, let's compute the energy per revolution. Each time the proton goes through the accelerating section, it gains energy. If each acceleration step is eU0, and each revolution involves two such steps (because the proton goes through two gaps each revolution), then each revolution provides 2eU0 of energy.

So the number of revolutions N would be the total energy divided by energy per revolution.

So N = (Total energy) / (Energy per revolution) = (950 MeV) / (2 * e * U0)

Wait, but wait, e is the proton charge in coulombs, but U0 is given in volts. So eU0 would be in eV. Let's compute it.

Wait, U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. So e * U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * 190e3 V = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = approx 3.044e-14 J. But wait, that's in joules, but we need to express the energy in eV.

Wait, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so e * U0 in eV is just U0 in volts. Because e * 1V = 1 eV. So e * U0 = 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV.

So each revolution gives 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. Wait, but wait, that's per revolution.

But the total energy needed is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. So N = 950,000 keV / 380 keV per rev = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500 revolutions.

Wait, but wait, 950,000 divided by 380. Let me compute that.

380 x 2500 = 950,000. Oh, exactly. So N=2500 revolutions.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the proton undergoes two accelerations. Maybe that's a different way of phrasing it. So perhaps each revolution involves two acceleration steps, meaning that each step is eU0, so each revolution gives 2eU0.

So, the total number of revolutions N is total energy / (2eU0) = 950 MeV / (2 * 190 keV) = 950,000 keV / (380 keV) = 2500. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the problem statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Does that mean that each revolution gives two accelerations, or that it took two steps? No, I think the 'two accelerations' is part of the setup, like the process involves two steps. But that might not affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration step is eU0, and the proton undergoes two such steps per revolution. So each revolution gives 2eU0. Then, the number of revolutions is N = 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV ) = 950000 / 380 = approx 2500.

Which matches option D.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives U(t) as a function of time. How does that tie into the calculation? Do we need to consider the time over which the acceleration occurs? Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we're assuming that each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton gains a fixed amount of energy. But in reality, the time taken for each revolution would change as the proton's speed increases, but the problem might be simplifying things.

Alternatively, since the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2πν(α)t + Φ0), the frequency ν(α) might be the same as the proton's rotation frequency. So the number of cycles is equal to the number of revolutions.

But then, how does this tie into the energy? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's not necessary for the calculation. The key seems to be the energy gained per revolution.

So, if each revolution provides 2eU0 of energy, then the total number of revolutions N is 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) = 2500. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. There's another thing. The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the initial velocity is very low. But as the proton gains energy, its speed increases, so each revolution doesn't take the same time. But since the question is asking for the number of revolutions, perhaps it's using the non-relativistic approach where the energy per revolution is constant, which might not be the case in reality. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe that's acceptable.

Another possible point of confusion is whether the voltage is applied in such a way that each revolution results in one acceleration step. For instance, maybe the voltage alternates each half-revolution, so each full revolution gives one acceleration. But that's conflicting with my earlier understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton goes through the accelerating gap, it's accelerated once. So each revolution would have two gaps, so two accelerations. So each revolution would add 2eU0 to the energy.

But let me think: in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied between the two D's, and the field alternates direction with each half-cycle. So as the proton moves from one D to the other, the potential difference is such that the proton gains energy. Then, on the other side, the potential is opposite, so when the proton comes back, it can gain another energy. So each revolution (two half-cycles of the electric field) gives two energy gains.

So each revolution adds 2eU0 to the kinetic energy.

Therefore, the calculation stands as N=2500.

Looking at the options, option D is 2500. So the answer should be D.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy required. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The alternating voltage applied is \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy as it passes through the electric field. Each revolution involves two acceleration steps, as the proton alternates between two gaps in the D-shaped electrodes. The energy gained per revolution is therefore \(2eU_0\), where \(e\) is the proton's charge and \(U_0\) is the peak voltage.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Energy per revolution**:  
   Each revolution provides an energy gain of \(2eU_0\).  
   Since \(eU_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) (as \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\) and \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\)),  
   \[
   \text{Energy per revolution} = 2 \times 190 \, \text{kV} = 380 \, \text{kV}.
   \]

2. **Total energy required**:  
   The proton needs a total energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{kV}\).

3. **Number of revolutions**:  
   The total number of revolutions \(N\) is given by:  
   \[
   N = \frac{\text{Total energy}}{\text{Energy per revolution}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{kV}}{380 \, \text{kV}} = 2500.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\). This corresponds to option **D**.
