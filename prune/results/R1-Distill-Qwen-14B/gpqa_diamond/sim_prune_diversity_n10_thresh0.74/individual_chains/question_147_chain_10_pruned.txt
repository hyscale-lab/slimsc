Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation, and I need to find the velocity of particle A. Hmm, let's see. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Wait, wait, no, the problem says it's p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Right, so protons and antiprotons annihilating into these other particles A⁺ and A⁻.

The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Oh, wait, that's the rest mass energy, I think. And the antiproton is moving slowly. So the antiproton's velocity is much less than c. That probably means that the kinetic energy is low compared to the rest mass energy, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, I remember that in annihilation reactions, the total energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the total energy is dominated by the rest mass of the proton and antiproton, plus a little kinetic energy. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the mass of the proton m_p is about 938 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of each is 938 MeV. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate their total energy as just their rest energies plus the kinetic energy. But wait, the problem says the antipro
