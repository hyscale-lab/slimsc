Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and producing photons. I remember that electrons and positrons annihilate each other, producing gamma-ray photons. But wait, the problem says two photons, so each must carry some energy and momentum.

So, the setup: an electron is moving from the left along the horizontal axis with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

First, I should remember some basic concepts. The Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means higher speed, closer to the speed of light. For the electron, gamma is 4, so it's moving pretty fast. The positron's gamma is 2, so it's also moving at relativistic speeds but not as fast as the electron.

Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their velocities are opposite in direction. So their momenta will have opposite signs. Let me think about momentum conservation here.

In any collision, the total momentum before should equal the total after. Since the system is isolated, momentum is conserved. So the total momentum of the electron and positron before collision must equal the total momentum of the two photons after.

Wait, but photons have momentum. The momentum of a photon is given by p = E/c, and it's directed in the same direction as the photon's movement. Also, the energy is the same for both photons, so their momenta should be the same in magnitude, but perhaps opposite in direction? Hmm, but wait, the photons are moving in different directions (upper-right and lower-right), so their momenta add vectorially.

Wait, no. Let me think. The initial system's total momentum is the sum of the electron and positron's momentum. Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So I need to calculate each momentum and add them.

So, let's model this. Let's take the horizontal axis as the x-axis. The electron is moving along +x (from left), and the positron is moving along -x (from right). Wait,
