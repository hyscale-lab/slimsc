Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar. It's good because it can handle droughts, but the bad part is that it has an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is making it unusable for food, so the goal is to eliminate it. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and after sequencing, they noticed some changes in the first exon area of the target gene in the mutants. The question is asking which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4, each with a different sequence change. Let me look at the sequences provided.

The intact gene is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the start codon is ATG, then TTTCTCGCTGGTACT, etc.

Now, looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, let's see where the changes are. Let's break it down. The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT... but in mutant 1, after ATG, it's TTCTACGCT? Wait, let me count the letters. Wait, perhaps I should write them out.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare each part. Let's take the first 20 nucleotides or so.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CT ACG TGG TAC TTCTGT... Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for point mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for changes in the amino acid sequence since the question is about function. Because the anti-nutritional compound is a product of the gene, a mutation that disrupts the gene's function (like a premature stop codon) would be desired.

So, each mutation would lead to a different protein product, perhaps. Let's see each mutant's DNA changes and how that translates into amino acids.

The process would be: DNA -> mRNA (transcription), then mRNA to protein (translation). Remember that DNA is in the 5' to 3' direction for the coding strand, and mRNA is complementary to the template strand, but same direction as coding.

Wait, the given sequences are the coding strands, I think, because they start with ATG, which is the start codon. So, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, but in the same direction as the coding strand.

So, to find the amino acids, I can take the DNA sequence, transcribe it into mRNA, and then translate into amino acids.

But wait, maybe it's easier to look
