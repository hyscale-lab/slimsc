Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. But I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. The components are 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, the strong ones will completely dissociate, so HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't fully dissociate. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So I need to figure out if the mixture is acidic, basic, or neutral.

First, I think I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Then, see if H+ is in excess or not. If the moles of H+ exceed OH-, the solution will be acidic, else basic.

Let me break it down step by step.

1. Calculate moles for each solution.
2. Find the total volume when they're mixed.
3. Determine the net moles of H+ or OH-.
4. Then find the concentration of H+ or OH-.
5. Use -log to find pH or pOH, depending on what's left.

Starting with CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll donate OH-.

Wait, but mixing an acid and a base will cause a neutralization reaction. So I need to compute the total H+ and OH- contributed by each solution, then subtract to see what's left.

Let me compute each component:

For CH3COOH (acetic acid):
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 mol.

But wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all its H+. But when HCl is added (which is a strong acid), it will increase the H+ concentration. Also
