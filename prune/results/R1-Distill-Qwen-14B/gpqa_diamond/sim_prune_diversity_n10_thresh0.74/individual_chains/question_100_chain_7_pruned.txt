Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. So, we have a series of reactions starting from Compound A (C3H6) and ending with Compound H. The question is about identifying the incorrect statement regarding the products.

First, I'll list out each reaction step to figure out what each compound might be. 

Starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. The formula C3H6 could be propene (since propene is C3H6, with the formula CH2=CH2CH3) or cyclopropane, but considering the reactions, propene seems more likely because bromination in CCl4 is a typical addition reaction for alkenes.

So, when propene undergoes bromination with CCl4, that's a dibromination via the bromonium ion mechanism. Wait, no, wait. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add bromine (Br2) in a diaddition, so Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. But I might be mixing up. Wait, when propene reacts with Br2 in CCl4, it's a diaddition across the double bond, so yes, 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to an elimination reaction. So, if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with KOH would lead to the elimination of HBr, forming an alkene. Which alkene? Since the dihalide is on C1 and C2, eliminating both would form 1-propene (propene again). Wait, but wait, elimination from 1,2-dibromopropane would form either 1-propene or maybe 2-propene, but propene is the same as 1-propene because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So Compound C would be propene again? Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound A was cyclopropane, but that's less likely because cyclopropane is more strained and less reactive in bromination. So probably, Compound C is propene.

Wait, but waitâ€”if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and upon treatment with alcoholic KOH, it will eliminate two equivalents of HBr. The KOH would deprotonate, take a bromide, form a double bond. The structure would be CH2=CH2CH3, which is propene. So, yes, C
