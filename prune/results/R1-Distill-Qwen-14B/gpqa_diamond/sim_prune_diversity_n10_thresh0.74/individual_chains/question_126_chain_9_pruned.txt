Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. The options are about the number of peaks observed in two different HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral.

First, let's break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.
LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is hexan-3-one, with a methoxy group at C5, and the configuration is S.

When LAH reduces a ketone, it converts the carbonyl (C=O) into a CH-OH group. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol. Wait, but since it's a secondary alcohol, the configuration (R/S) would depend on the starting material. Wait, the starting material is an (S)-configured compound. Hmm. Wait, the starting molecule is a ketone, which is planar, so the configuration at C5 (the methoxy group) is S. But when it's reduced, the ketone (C3) becomes an alcohol. So the product will be 3-hexanol, but wait, no.

Wait, the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. Wait no, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3

But the 5-methoxy group would be on the fifth carbon. So it's:

CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 ?

Wait, wait, let's number the carbons. For hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

1   2   3       4   5   6
CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. Wait, that's the same as the CH2 group in position 5. So the structure would be:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So the molecule is (S)-configured at C5.

So when we reduce this with LAH, the ket
