Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told to assume LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the probability of a particle being in a higher energy state depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * e^(-ΔE/(kT)). Here, g's are the statistical weights, but the question says the excitation is twice as much. So maybe the statistical weights are the same for both stars, so they cancel out?

Wait, but the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice the ratio n2_upper / n2_lower. Or maybe the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so their ratios are in a 2:1 proportion.

Let me think. Let’s denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = 2 R2. Or wait, star_1 is twice as excited, so maybe R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So I think the excitation is twice. So the ratio of the populations (excited state to ground state, perhaps) is twice as large in star_1 as in star_2.

So let me write this as R1 = 2 * R2. But from the Boltzmann equation, R = (g_upper/g_lower) * e^(-ΔE/(kT)). Assuming g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars (
