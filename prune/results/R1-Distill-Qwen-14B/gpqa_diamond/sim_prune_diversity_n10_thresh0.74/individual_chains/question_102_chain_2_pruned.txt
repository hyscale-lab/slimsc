Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving some genetic constructs and protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup uses a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive expression of the ligand. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which I think is used for co-expression of two genes, so maybe the receptor is under the control of the same promoter but after the IRES?

Wait, the vector has specific stop cassettes. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So normally, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but only if the loxP cassette is excised. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with eGFP if the lox2272 cassette is excised. Oh, I see! Because loxP and lox2272 are different sites, Cre recombinase can only cut one of them.

Wait, wait. So the Cre construct is under the control of SOX10-Cre, right? Because when they crossed the mouse model with SOX10-Cre, which is a transactivator for neural crest cells. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So when Cre is expressed, it should excise the stop cassettes.

So in the mouse model, when the Cre is active, it should delete the lox sites. Let me think about the vector. The vector is a bicistronic construct with ligand first, then the receptor. The ligand is under CBA promoter, and the receptor is under IRES, I think. Wait, no. Wait, the vector is set up so the ligand's ORF is under CBA, then after the ligand, there's the stop cassette. The receptor is after an IRES, right? Because the CBA promoter would drive the ligand, then the IRES would drive the receptor. Because the IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without a second promoter. So the construct would have:
5' CBA promoter -> Ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry
Then, after the IRES, which is upstream of the receptor, so the structure is:
... IRES -> Receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. Let's say the vector's backbone is something like:

Promoter (CBA) --> Ligand ORF --> loxP-stop
