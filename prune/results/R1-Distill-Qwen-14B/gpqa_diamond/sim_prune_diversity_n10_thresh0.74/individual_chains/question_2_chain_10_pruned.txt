Okay, so I'm tackling this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me start by breaking down each step of the reaction process.

First, the starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has the structure where a benzene ring is connected to a propenal group (CH₂=CHCHO). Wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually an aromatic aldehyde. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. More precisely, it's an aldehyde with a double bond adjacent to the aromatic ring. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO. Or wait, no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO. No, actually, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Oh right, the structure is benzene ring connected to CH₂=CHCHO. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is Ph-CH₂-COOH. But wait, the aldehyde would be Ph-CH₂-CHO. Hmm, that doesn’t sound right. No, wait, cinnamaldehyde is an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, so the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, the double bond is between the benzene ring and the aldehyde. Oh wait, no, the structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So more accurately, it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me visualize it correctly. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a propenyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, that's longer. Oh, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that's just benzaldehyde with a methyl group. No, I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think the correct structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzene ring with a double bond attached. So it's Ph-CH₂-CHO. No, wait. No, I think I'm mixing it up. The correct structure of c
