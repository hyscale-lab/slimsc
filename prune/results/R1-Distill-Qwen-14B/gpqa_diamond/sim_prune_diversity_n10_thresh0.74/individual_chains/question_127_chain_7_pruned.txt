Okay, so I've got to figure out which molecule is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially in the presence of certain conditions, they can undergo reactions like dehydrohalogenation or maybe elimination. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, when alkenes undergo elimination, it's usually a dehydration reaction, but wait, that's if there's a hydroxyl group. Or is this about something else?

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is the starting material. So that's a diene, right? But I'm a bit confused. So the formula would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think. Buty means four carbons, right? So 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would have a nine-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 2 and 6, and a four-carbon substituent (butyl) attached at position 5.

Wait, structure matters here. Let me draw it out. Nona is nine carbons. So the main chain is nine carbons. The butyl group is on the fifth carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the butyl is on carbon 5. Let me number the main chain. So the main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds at positions 2 and 6.

So positions 1 to 9.

Position 2: double bond
Position 6: double bond

At position 5, there's a butyl group. So the structure is:

1: CH2-
2: CH2- with a double bond (so CH2=CH-)
Wait, no, for the main chain, number starts from the end that gives the lower numbers for the double bonds. Oh wait, no, the double bonds are at 2 and 6, so the main chain is numbered so that the first double bond starts at position 2, and the second at 6. 

Wait, maybe the structure is: 

Positions 1  2     3 4 5  6    7 8 9
