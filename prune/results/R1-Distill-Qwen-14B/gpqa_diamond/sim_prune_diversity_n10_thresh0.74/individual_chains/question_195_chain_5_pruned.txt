Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

Okay, the question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Now, the question is asking about the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the first one. The key here is that both transit and occultation events need to occur.

Wait, so what's the deal with transits and occultations? I remember that a transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, which would cause a slight brightening because the planet's reflected light is no longer visible. But for both events to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that they can pass in front and behind each other relative to the star. Or wait, is it that the second planet must be able to transit in front of the star and also have the star eclipse it (i.e., the first planet would cause an occultation on the second planet)? Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, no. The second planet needs to transit, meaning it passes in front of the star, and also be occulted, meaning the star passes in front of it (so when the star is between us and the planet). So both events must be possible. But how does that affect their orbital periods?

Oh, right, for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned such that its path (as seen from Earth) intersects the star. The impact parameter affects whether a transit happens. Impact parameter is the distance (in terms of the star's radius) from the center of the star when the planet is at the closest point during transit. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach, and a higher one means a more grazing transit.

But wait, in this problem, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. So the first planet's orbit must be such that
